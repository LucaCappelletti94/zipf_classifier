There is no such thing as "the Queen's English." The property has goneinto the hands of a joint stock company and we own the bulk of theshares! --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Frequently, in Australia, one has cloud-effects of an unfamiliar sort.We had this kind of scenery, finely staged, all the way to Ballarat.Consequently we saw more sky than country on that journey. At one time agreat stretch of the vault was densely flecked with wee ragged-edgedflakes of painfully white cloud-stuff, all of one shape and size, andequidistant apart, with narrow cracks of adorable blue showing between.The whole was suggestive of a hurricane of snow-flakes drifting acrossthe skies. By and by these flakes fused themselves together ininterminable lines, with shady faint hollows between the lines, the longsatin-surfaced rollers following each other in simulated movement, andenchantingly counterfeiting the majestic march of a flowing sea. Later,the sea solidified itself; then gradually broke up its mass intoinnumerable lofty white pillars of about one size, and ranged theseacross the firmament, in receding and fading perspective, in thesimilitude of a stupendous colonnade--a mirage without a doubt flung fromthe far Gates of the Hereafter.
The approaches to Ballarat were beautiful. The features, great greenexpanses of rolling pasture-land, bisected by eye contenting hedges ofcommingled new-gold and old-gold gorse--and a lovely lake. One must putin the pause, there, to fetch the reader up with a slight jolt, and keephim from gliding by without noticing the lake. One must notice it; for alovely lake is not as common a thing along the railways of Australia asare the dry places. Ninety-two in the shade again, but balmy andcomfortable, fresh and bracing. A perfect climate.
Forty-five years ago the site now occupied by the City of Ballarat was asylvan solitude as quiet as Eden and as lovely. Nobody had ever heard ofit. On the 25th of August, 1851, the first great gold-strike made inAustralia was made here. The wandering prospectors who made it scrapedup two pounds and a half of gold the first day-worth $600. A few dayslater the place was a hive--a town. The news of the strike spreadeverywhere in a sort of instantaneous way--spread like a flash to thevery ends of the earth. A celebrity so prompt and so universal hashardly been paralleled in history, perhaps. It was as if the nameBALLARAT had suddenly been written on the sky, where all the world couldread it at once.
The smaller discoveries made in the colony of New South Wales threemonths before had already started emigrants toward Australia; they hadbeen coming as a stream, but they came as a flood, now. A hundredthousand people poured into Melbourne from England and other countries ina single month, and flocked away to the mines. The crews of the shipsthat brought them flocked with them; the clerks in the government officesfollowed; so did the cooks, the maids, the coachmen, the butlers, and theother domestic servants; so did the carpenters, the smiths, the plumbers,the painters, the reporters, the editors, the lawyers, the clients, thebarkeepers, the bummers, the blacklegs, the thieves, the loose women, thegrocers, the butchers, the bakers, the doctors, the druggists, thenurses; so did the police; even officials of high and hitherto enviedplace threw up their positions and joined the procession. This roaringavalanche swept out of Melbourne and left it desolate, Sunday-like,paralyzed, everything at a stand-still, the ships lying idle at anchor,all signs of life departed, all sounds stilled save the rasping of thecloud-shadows as they scraped across the vacant streets.
That grassy and leafy paradise at Ballarat was soon ripped open, andlacerated and scarified and gutted, in the feverish search for its hiddenriches. There is nothing like surface-mining to snatch the graces andbeauties and benignities out of a paradise, and make an odious andrepulsive spectacle of it.
What fortunes were made! Immigrants got rich while the ship unloaded andreloaded--and went back home for good in the same cabin they had come outin! Not all of them. Only some. I saw the others in Ballarat myself,forty-five years later--what were left of them by time and death and thedisposition to rove. They were young and gay, then; they are patriarchaland grave, now; and they do not get excited any more. They talk of thePast. They live in it. Their life is a dream, a retrospection.
Ballarat was a great region for "nuggets." No such nuggets were found inCalifornia as Ballarat produced. In fact, the Ballarat region hasyielded the largest ones known to history. Two of them weighed about 180pounds each, and together were worth $90,000. They were offered to anypoor person who would shoulder them and carry them away. Gold was soplentiful that it made people liberal like that.
Ballarat was a swarming city of tents in the early days. Everybody washappy, for a time, and apparently prosperous. Then came trouble. Thegovernment swooped down with a mining tax. And in its worst form, too;for it was not a tax upon what the miner had taken out, but upon what hewas going to take out--if he could find it. It was a license-tax licenseto work his claim--and it had to be paid before he could begin digging.
Consider the situation. No business is so uncertain as surface-mining.Your claim may be good, and it may be worthless. It may make you welloff in a month; and then again you may have to dig and slave for half ayear, at heavy expense, only to find out at last that the gold is notthere in cost-paying quantity, and that your time and your hard work havebeen thrown away. It might be wise policy to advance the miner a monthlysum to encourage him to develop the country's riches; but to tax himmonthly in advance instead--why, such a thing was never dreamed of inAmerica. There, neither the claim itself nor its products, howsoeverrich or poor, were taxed.
The Ballarat miners protested, petitioned, complained--it was of no use;the government held its ground, and went on collecting the tax. And notby pleasant methods, but by ways which must have been very galling tofree people. The rumblings of a coming storm began to be audible.
By and by there was a result; and I think it may be called the finestthing in Australasian history. It was a revolution--small in size; butgreat politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for aprinciple, a stand against injustice and oppression. It was the Baronsand John, over again; it was Hampden and Ship-Money; it was Concord andLexington; small beginnings, all of them, but all of them great inpolitical results, all of them epoch-making. It is another instance of avictory won by a lost battle. It adds an honorable page to history; thepeople know it and are proud of it. They keep green the memory of themen who fell at the Eureka Stockade, and Peter Lalor has his monument.
The surface-soil of Ballarat was full of gold. This soil the minersripped and tore and trenched and harried and disembowled, and made ityield up its immense treasure. Then they went down into the earth withdeep shafts, seeking the gravelly beds of ancient rivers and brooks--andfound them. They followed the courses of these streams, and gutted them,sending the gravel up in buckets to the upper world, and washing out ofit its enormous deposits of gold. The next biggest of the two monsternuggets mentioned above came from an old river-channel 180 feet underground.
Finally the quartz lodes were attacked. That is not poor-man's mining.Quartz-mining and milling require capital, and staying-power, andpatience. Big companies were formed, and for several decades, now, thelodes have been successfully worked, and have yielded great wealth.Since the gold discovery in 1853 the Ballarat mines--taking the threekinds of mining together--have contributed to the world's pocketsomething over three hundred millions of dollars, which is to say thatthis nearly invisible little spot on the earth's surface has yieldedabout one-fourth as much gold in forty-four years as all California hasyielded in forty-seven. The Californian aggregate, from 1848 to 1895,inclusive, as reported by the Statistician of the United States Mint, is$1,265,215,217.
A citizen told me a curious thing about those mines. With all myexperience of mining I had never heard of anything of the sort before.The main gold reef runs about north and south--of course for that is thecustom of a rich gold reef. At Ballarat its course is between walls ofslate. Now the citizen told me that throughout a stretch of twelve milesalong the reef, the reef is crossed at intervals by a straight blackstreak of a carbonaceous nature--a streak in the slate; a streak nothicker than a pencil--and that wherever it crosses the reef you willcertainly find gold at the junction. It is called the Indicator. Thirtyfeet on each side of the Indicator (and down in the slate, of course) isa still finer streak--a streak as fine as a pencil mark; and indeed, thatis its name Pencil Mark. Whenever you find the Pencil Mark you know thatthirty feet from it is the Indicator; you measure the distance, excavate,find the Indicator, trace it straight to the reef, and sink your shaft;your fortune is made, for certain. If that is true, it is curious. Andit is curious anyway.
Ballarat is a town of only 40,000 population; and yet, since it is inAustralia, it has every essential of an advanced and enlightened bigcity. This is pure matter of course. I must stop dwelling upon thesethings. It is hard to keep from dwelling upon them, though; for it isdifficult to get away from the surprise of it. I will let the otherdetails go, this time, but I must allow myself to mention that thislittle town has a park of 326 acres; a flower garden of 83 acres, with anelaborate and expensive fernery in it and some costly and unusually finestatuary; and an artificial lake covering 600 acres, equipped with afleet of 200 shells, small sail boats, and little steam yachts.
At this point I strike out some other praiseful things which I wastempted to add. I do not strike them out because they were not true ornot well said, but because I find them better said by another man--and aman more competent to testify, too, because he belongs on the ground, andknows. I clip them from a chatty speech delivered some years ago by Mr.William Little, who was at that time mayor of Ballarat:
 "The language of our citizens, in this as in other parts of Australasia, is mostly healthy Anglo-Saxon, free from Americanisms, vulgarisms, and the conflicting dialects of our Fatherland, and is pure enough to suit a Trench or a Latham. Our youth, aided by climatic influence, are in point of physique and comeliness unsurpassed in the Sunny South. Our young men are well ordered; and our maidens, 'not stepping over the bounds of modesty,' are as fair as Psyches, dispensing smiles as charming as November flowers."
The closing clause has the seeming of a rather frosty compliment, butthat is apparent only, not real. November is summer-time there.
His compliment to the local purity of the language is warranted. It isquite free from impurities; this is acknowledged far and wide. As in theGerman Empire all cultivated people claim to speak Hanovarian German, soin Australasia all cultivated people claim to speak Ballarat English.Even in England this cult has made considerable progress, and now that itis favored by the two great Universities, the time is not far away whenBallarat English will come into general use among the educated classes ofGreat Britain at large. Its great merit is, that it is shorter thanordinary English--that is, it is more compressed. At first you have somedifficulty in understanding it when it is spoken as rapidly as the oratorwhom I have quoted speaks it. An illustration will show what I mean.When he called and I handed him a chair, he bowed and said:
"Q."
Presently, when we were lighting our cigars, he held a match to mine andI said:
"Thank you," and he said:
"Km."
Then I saw. 'Q' is the end of the phrase "I thank you" 'Km' is the endof the phrase "You are welcome." Mr. Little puts no emphasis upon eitherof them, but delivers them so reduced that they hardly have a sound. AllBallarat English is like that, and the effect is very soft and pleasant;it takes all the hardness and harshness out of our tongue and gives to ita delicate whispery and vanishing cadence which charms the ear like thefaint rustling of the forest leaves.
