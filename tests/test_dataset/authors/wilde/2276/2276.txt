(To Ellen Terry)
As one who poring on a Grecian urnScans the fair shapes some Attic hand hath made,God with slim goddess, goodly man with maid,And for their beauty's sake is loth to turnAnd face the obvious day, must I not yearnFor many a secret moon of indolent bliss,When in midmost shrine of ArtemisI see thee standing, antique-limbed, and stern?
And yet--methinks I'd rather see thee playThat serpent of old Nile, whose witcheryMade Emperors drunken,--come, great Egypt, shakeOur stage with all thy mimic pageants! Nay,I am grown sick of unreal passions, makeThe world thine Actium, me thine Anthony!
