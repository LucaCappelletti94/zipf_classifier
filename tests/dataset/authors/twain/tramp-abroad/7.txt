CHAPTER VII [How Bismark Fought]
In addition to the corps laws, there are some corps usages which havethe force of laws.
Perhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership whois no longer an exempt--that is a freshman--has remained a sophomoresome little time without volunteering to fight; some day, the president,instead of calling for volunteers, will APPOINT this sophomoreto measure swords with a student of another corps; he is free todecline--everybody says so--there is no compulsion. This is alltrue--but I have not heard of any student who DID decline; to declineand still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous,and properly so, since he knew, when he joined, that his mainbusiness, as a member, would be to fight. No, there is no law againstdeclining--except the law of custom, which is confessedly stronger thanwritten law, everywhere.
The ten men whose duels I had witnessed did not go away when their hurtswere dressed, as I had supposed they would, but came back, one afteranother, as soon as they were free of the surgeon, and mingled with theassemblage in the dueling-room. The white-cap student who won the secondfight witnessed the remaining three, and talked with us during theintermissions. He could not talk very well, because his opponent's swordhad cut his under-lip in two, and then the surgeon had sewed it togetherand overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches; neither couldhe eat easily, still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesomeluncheon while the last duel was preparing. The man who was the worsthurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement. A goodpart of his face was covered with patches and bandages, and all therest of his head was covered and concealed by them. It is said that thestudent likes to appear on the street and in other public places inthis kind of array, and that this predilection often keeps him out whenexposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for him. Newly bandagedstudents are a very common spectacle in the public gardens ofHeidelberg. It is also said that the student is glad to get wounds inthe face, because the scars they leave will show so well there; and itis also said that these face wounds are so prized that youths have evenbeen known to pull them apart from time to time and put red wine in themto make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar as possible. Itdoes not look reasonable, but it is roundly asserted and maintained,nevertheless; I am sure of one thing--scars are plenty enough inGermany, among the young men; and very grim ones they are, too.They crisscross the face in angry red welts, and are permanent andineffaceable. Some of these scars are of a very strange and dreadfulaspect; and the effect is striking when several such accent the milderones, which form a city map on a man's face; they suggest the "burneddistrict" then. We had often noticed that many of the students worea colored silk band or ribbon diagonally across their breasts. Ittranspired that this signifies that the wearer has fought three duelsin which a decision was reached--duels in which he either whipped orwas whipped--for drawn battles do not count. [1] After a student hasreceived his ribbon, he is "free"; he can cease from fighting, withoutreproach--except some one insult him; his president cannot appoint himto fight; he can volunteer if he wants to, or remain quiescent if heprefers to do so. Statistics show that he does NOT prefer to remainquiescent. They show that the duel has a singular fascination about itsomewhere, for these free men, so far from resting upon the privilegeof the badge, are always volunteering. A corps student told me it was ofrecord that Prince Bismarck fought thirty-two of these duels in a singlesummer term when he was in college. So he fought twenty-nine after hisbadge had given him the right to retire from the field. 
 1. FROM MY DIARY.--Dined in a hotel a few miles up the Neckar,    in a room whose walls were hung all over with framed    portrait-groups of the Five Corps; some were recent,    but many antedated photography, and were pictured in    lithography--the dates ranged back to forty or fifty    years ago.  Nearly every individual wore the ribbon across    his breast.  In one portrait-group representing (as each    of these pictures did) an entire Corps, I took pains    to count the ribbons: there were twenty-seven members,    and twenty-one of them wore that significant badge.
The statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars.Two days in every week are devoted to dueling. The rule is rigid thatthere must be three duels on each of these days; there are generallymore, but there cannot be fewer. There were six the day I was present;sometimes there are seven or eight. It is insisted that eight duels aweek--four for each of the two days--is too low an average to drawa calculation from, but I will reckon from that basis, preferring anunderstatement to an overstatement of the case. This requires about fourhundred and eighty or five hundred duelists a year--for in summer thecollege term is about three and a half months, and in winter it is fourmonths and sometimes longer. Of the seven hundred and fifty students inthe university at the time I am writing of, only eighty belonged to thefive corps, and it is only these corps that do the dueling; occasionallyother students borrow the arms and battleground of the five corps inorder to settle a quarrel, but this does not happen every dueling-day.[2] Consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundredand fifty duels a year. This average gives six fights a year to eachof the eighty. This large work could not be accomplished if thebadge-holders stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer.
 2. They have to borrow the arms because they could not    get them elsewhere or otherwise.  As I understand it,    the public authorities, all over Germany, allow the five    Corps to keep swords, but DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO USE THEM.    This is law is rigid; it is only the execution of it that    is lax.
Of course, where there is so much fighting, the students make it a pointto keep themselves in constant practice with the foil. One often seesthem, at the tables in the Castle grounds, using their whips or canes toillustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about; and betweenthe duels, on the day whose history I have been writing, the swords werenot always idle; every now and then we heard a succession of the keenhissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through itspaces in the air, and this informed us that a student was practicing.Necessarily, this unceasing attention to the art develops an expertoccasionally. He becomes famous in his own university, his renownspreads to other universities. He is invited to Goettingen, to fightwith a Goettingen expert; if he is victorious, he will be invitedto other colleges, or those colleges will send their experts to him.Americans and Englishmen often join one or another of the five corps. Ayear or two ago, the principal Heidelberg expert was a big Kentuckian;he was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victorybehind him all about Germany; but at last a little student in Strasburgdefeated him. There was formerly a student in Heidelberg who had pickedup somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under insteadof cleaving down from above. While the trick lasted he won in sixteensuccessive duels in his university; but by that time observers haddiscovered what his charm was, and how to break it, therefore hischampionship ceased.
A rule which forbids social intercourse between members of differentcorps is strict. In the dueling-house, in the parks, on the street,and anywhere and everywhere that the students go, caps of a color groupthemselves together. If all the tables in a public garden were crowdedbut one, and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacantplaces, the yellow-caps, the blue-caps, the white caps, and the greencaps, seeking seats, would go by that table and not seem to see it, norseem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds. The studentby whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place, worethe white cap--Prussian Corps. He introduced us to many white caps, butto none of another color. The corps etiquette extended even to us, whowere strangers, and required us to group with the white corps only, andspeak only with the white corps, while we were their guests, and keepaloof from the caps of the other colors. Once I wished to examine someof the swords, but an American student said, "It would not be quitepolite; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue; they willbring in some with white hilts presently, and those you can handlefreely." When a sword was broken in the first duel, I wanted a pieceof it; but its hilt was the wrong color, so it was considered best andpolitest to await a properer season. It was brought to me after the roomwas cleared, and I will now make a "life-size" sketch of it by tracing aline around it with my pen, to show the width of the weapon. [Figure1] The length of these swords is about three feet, and they are quiteheavy. One's disposition to cheer, during the course of the duels orat their close, was naturally strong, but corps etiquette forbade anydemonstrations of this sort. However brilliant a contest or a victorymight be, no sign or sound betrayed that any one was moved. A dignifiedgravity and repression were maintained at all times.
When the dueling was finished and we were ready to go, the gentlemen ofthe Prussian Corps to whom we had been introduced took off their capsin the courteous German way, and also shook hands; their brethren of thesame order took off their caps and bowed, but without shaking hands; thegentlemen of the other corps treated us just as they would have treatedwhite caps--they fell apart, apparently unconsciously, and left us anunobstructed pathway, but did not seem to see us or know we were there.If we had gone thither the following week as guests of another corps,the white caps, without meaning any offense, would have observed theetiquette of their order and ignored our presence.
     [How strangely are comedy and tragedy blended in this life!     I had not been home a full half-hour, after witnessing those     playful sham-duels, when circumstances made it necessary for     me to get ready immediately to assist personally at a real     one--a duel with no effeminate limitation in the matter of     results, but a battle to the death.  An account of it, in     the next chapter, will show the reader that duels between     boys, for fun, and duels between men in earnest, are very     different affairs.]
