PEOPLE often talk as if there was an opposition between what isbeautiful and what is useful. There is no opposition to beautyexcept ugliness: all things are either beautiful or ugly, andutility will be always on the side of the beautiful thing, becausebeautiful decoration is always on the side of the beautiful thing,because beautiful decoration is always an expression of the use youput a thing to and the value placed on it. No workman willbeautifully decorate bad work, nor can you possibly get goodhandicraftsmen or workmen without having beautiful designs. Youshould be quite sure of that. If you have poor and worthlessdesigns in any craft or trade you will get poor and worthlessworkmen only, but the minute you have noble and beautiful designs,then you get men of power and intellect and feeling to work foryou. By having good designs you have workmen who work not merelywith their hands but with their hearts and heads too; otherwise youwill get merely the fool or the loafer to work for you.
That the beauty of life is a thing of no moment, I suppose fewpeople would venture to assert. And yet most civilised people actas if it were of none, and in so doing are wronging both themselvesand those that are to come after them. For that beauty which ismeant by art is no mere accident of human life which people cantake or leave, but a positive necessity of life if we are to liveas nature meant us to, that is to say unless we are content to beless than men.
Do not think that the commercial spirit which is the basis of yourlife and cities here is opposed to art. Who built the beautifulcities of the world but commercial men and commercial men only?Genoa built by its traders, Florence by its bankers, and Venice,most lovely of all, by its noble and honest merchants.
I do not wish you, remember, 'to build a new Pisa,' nor to bring'the life or the decorations of the thirteenth century back again.''The circumstances with which you must surround your workmen arethose' of modern American life, 'because the designs you have nowto ask for from your workmen are such as will make modern' American'life beautiful.' The art we want is the art based on all theinventions of modern civilisation, and to suit all the needs ofnineteenth-century life.
Do you think, for instance, that we object to machinery? I tellyou we reverence it; we reverence it when it does its proper work,when it relieves man from ignoble and soulless labour, not when itseeks to do that which is valuable only when wrought by the handsand hearts of men. Let us have no machine-made ornament at all; itis all bad and worthless and ugly. And let us not mistake themeans of civilisation for the end of civilisation; steam-engine,telephone and the like, are all wonderful, but remember that theirvalue depends entirely on the noble uses we make of them, on thenoble spirit in which we employ them, not on the things themselves.
It is, no doubt, a great advantage to talk to a man at theAntipodes through a telephone; its advantage depends entirely onthe value of what the two men have to say to one another. If onemerely shrieks slander through a tube and the other whispers follyinto a wire, do not think that anybody is very much benefited bythe invention.
The train that whirls an ordinary Englishman through Italy at therate of forty miles an hour and finally sends him home without anymemory of that lovely country but that he was cheated by a courierat Rome, or that he got a bad dinner at Verona, does not do him orcivilisation much good. But that swift legion of fiery-footedengines that bore to the burning ruins of Chicago the loving helpand generous treasure of the world was as noble and as beautiful asany golden troop of angels that ever fed the hungry and clothed thenaked in the antique times. As beautiful, yes; all machinery maybe beautiful when it is undecorated even. Do not seek to decorateit. We cannot but think all good machinery is graceful, also, theline of strength and the line of beauty being one.
Give then, as I said, to your workmen of to-day the bright andnoble surroundings that you can yourself create. Stately andsimple architecture for your cities, bright and simple dress foryour men and women; those are the conditions of a real artisticmovement. For the artist is not concerned primarily with anytheory of life but with life itself, with the joy and lovelinessthat should come daily on eye and ear for a beautiful externalworld.
But the simplicity must not be barrenness nor the bright colourgaudy. For all beautiful colours are graduated colours, thecolours that seem about to pass into one another's realm - colourwithout tone being like music without harmony, mere discord.Barren architecture, the vulgar and glaring advertisements thatdesecrate not merely your cities but every rock and river that Ihave seen yet in America - all this is not enough. A school ofdesign we must have too in each city. It should be a stately andnoble building, full of the best examples of the best art of theworld. Furthermore, do not put your designers in a barrenwhitewashed room and bid them work in that depressing andcolourless atmosphere as I have seen many of the American schoolsof design, but give them beautiful surroundings. Because you wantto produce a permanent canon and standard of taste in your workman,he must have always by him and before him specimens of the bestdecorative art of the world, so that you can say to him: 'This isgood work. Greek or Italian or Japanese wrought it so many yearsago, but it is eternally young because eternally beautiful.' Workin this spirit and you will be sure to be right. Do not copy it,but work with the same love, the same reverence, the same freedomof imagination. You must teach him colour and design, how allbeautiful colours are graduated colours and glaring colours theessence of vulgarity. Show him the quality of any beautiful workof nature like the rose, or any beautiful work of art like anEastern carpet - being merely the exquisite gradation of colour,one tone answering another like the answering chords of a symphony.Teach him how the true designer is not he who makes the design andthen colours it, but he who designs in colour, creates in colour,thinks in colour too. Show him how the most gorgeous stained-glasswindows of Europe are filled with white glass, and the mostgorgeous Eastern tapestry with toned colours - the primary coloursin both places being set in the white glass, and the tone colourslike brilliant jewels set in dusky gold. And then as regardsdesign, show him how the real designer will take first any givenlimited space, little disk of silver, it may be, like a Greek coin,or wide expanse of fretted ceiling or lordly wall as Tintoret choseat Venice (it does not matter which), and to this limited space -the first condition of decoration being the limitation of the sizeof the material used - he will give the effect of its being filledwith beautiful decoration, filled with it as a golden cup will befilled with wine, so complete that you should not be able to takeaway anything from it or add anything to it. For from a good pieceof design you can take away nothing, nor can you add anything toit, each little bit of design being as absolutely necessary and asvitally important to the whole effect as a note or chord of musicis for a sonata of Beethoven.
But I said the effect of its being so filled, because this, again,is of the essence of good design. With a simple spray of leavesand a bird in flight a Japanese artist will give you the impressionthat he has completely covered with lovely design the reed fan orlacquer cabinet at which he is working, merely because he knows theexact spot in which to place them. All good design depends on thetexture of the utensil used and the use you wish to put it to. Oneof the first things I saw in an American school of design was ayoung lady painting a romantic moonlight landscape on a large rounddish, and another young lady covering a set of dinner plates with aseries of sunsets of the most remarkable colours. Let your ladiespaint moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let them paintthem on dinner plates or dishes. Let them take canvas or paper forsuch work, but not clay or china. They are merely painting thewrong subjects on the wrong material, that is all. They have notbeen taught that every material and texture has certain qualitiesof its own. The design suitable for one is quite wrong for theother, just as the design which you should work on a flat table-cover ought to be quite different from the design you would work ona curtain, for the one will always be straight, the other brokeninto folds; and the use too one puts the object to should guide onein the choice of design. One does not want to eat one's terrapinsoff a romantic moonlight nor one's clams off a harrowing sunset.Glory of sun and moon, let them be wrought for us by our landscapeartist and be on the walls of the rooms we sit in to remind us ofthe undying beauty of the sunsets that fade and die, but do not letus eat our soup off them and send them down to the kitchen twice aday to be washed and scrubbed by the handmaid.
All these things are simple enough, yet nearly always forgotten.Your school of design here will teach your girls and your boys,your handicraftsmen of the future (for all your schools of artshould be local schools, the schools of particular cities). Wetalk of the Italian school of painting, but there is no Italianschool; there were the schools of each city. Every town in Italy,from Venice itself, queen of the sea, to the little hill fortressof Perugia, each had its own school of art, each different and allbeautiful.
So do not mind what art Philadelphia or New York is having, butmake by the hands of your own citizens beautiful art for the joy ofyour own citizens, for you have here the primary elements of agreat artistic movement.
For, believe me, the conditions of art are much simpler than peopleimagine. For the noblest art one requires a clear healthyatmosphere, not polluted as the air of our English cities is by thesmoke and grime and horridness which comes from open furnace andfrom factory chimney. You must have strong, sane, healthy physiqueamong your men and women. Sickly or idle or melancholy people donot do much in art. And lastly, you require a sense ofindividualism about each man and woman, for this is the essence ofart - a desire on the part of man to express himself in the noblestway possible. And this is the reason that the grandest art of theworld always came from a republic: Athens, Venice, and Florence -there were no kings there and so their art was as noble and simpleas sincere. But if you want to know what kind of art the folly ofkings will impose on a country look at the decorative art of Franceunder the GRAND MONARQUE, under Louis the Fourteenth; the gaudygilt furniture writhing under a sense of its own horror andugliness, with a nymph smirking at every angle and a dragonmouthing on every claw. Unreal and monstrous art this, and fitonly for such periwigged pomposities as the nobility of France atthat time, but not at all fit for you or me. We do not want therich to possess more beautiful things but the poor to create morebeautiful things; for ever man is poor who cannot create. Norshall the art which you and I need be merely a purple robe woven bya slave and thrown over the whitened body of some leprous king toadorn or to conceal the sin of his luxury, but rather shall it bethe noble and beautiful expression of a people's noble andbeautiful life. Art shall be again the most glorious of all thechords through which the spirit of a great nation finds its noblestutterance.
All around you, I said, lie the conditions for a great artisticmovement for every great art. Let us think of one of them; asculptor, for instance.
If a modern sculptor were to come and say, 'Very well, but wherecan one find subjects for sculpture out of men who wear frock-coatsand chimney-pot hats?' I would tell him to go to the docks of agreat city and watch the men loading or unloading the statelyships, working at wheel or windlass, hauling at rope or gangway. Ihave never watched a man do anything useful who has not beengraceful at some moment of his labour: it is only the loafer andthe idle saunterer who is as useless and uninteresting to theartist as he is to himself. I would ask the sculptor to go with meto any of your schools or universities, to the running ground andgymnasium, to watch the young men start for a race, hurling quoitor club, kneeling to tie their shoes before leaping, stepping fromthe boat or bending to the oar, and to carve them; and when he wasweary of cities I would ask him to come to your fields and meadowsto watch the reaper with his sickle and the cattle-driver withlifted lasso. For if a man cannot find the noblest motives for hisart in such simple daily things as a woman drawing water from thewell or a man leaning with his scythe, he will not find themanywhere at all. Gods and goddesses the Greek carved because heloved them; saint and king the Goth because he believed in them.But you, you do not care much for Greek gods and goddesses, and youare perfectly and entirely right; and you do not think much ofkings either, and you are quite right. But what you do love areyour own men and women, your own flowers and fields, your own hillsand mountains, and these are what your art should represent to you.
Ours has been the first movement which has brought thehandicraftsman and the artist together, for remember that byseparating the one from the other you do ruin to both; you rob theone of all spiritual motive and all imaginative joy, you isolatethe other from all real technical perfection. The two greatestschools of art in the world, the sculptor at Athens and the schoolof painting at Venice, had their origin entirely in a longsuccession of simple and earnest handicraftsmen. It was the Greekpotter who taught the sculptor that restraining influence of designwhich was the glory of the Parthenon; it was the Italian decoratorof chests and household goods who kept Venetian painting alwaystrue to its primary pictorial condition of noble colour. For weshould remember that all the arts are fine arts and all the artsdecorative arts. The greatest triumph of Italian painting was thedecoration of a pope's chapel in Rome and the wall of a room inVenice. Michael Angelo wrought the one, and Tintoret, the dyer'sson, the other. And the little 'Dutch landscape, which you putover your sideboard to-day, and between the windows to-morrow, is'no less a glorious 'piece of work than the extents of field andforest with which Benozzo has made green and beautiful the oncemelancholy arcade of the Campo Santo at Pisa,' as Ruskin says.
Do not imitate the works of a nation, Greek or Japanese, Italian orEnglish; but their artistic spirit of design and their artisticattitude to-day, their own world, you should absorb but imitatenever, copy never. Unless you can make as beautiful a design inpainted china or embroidered screen or beaten brass out of yourAmerican turkey as the Japanese does out of his grey silver-wingedstork, you will never do anything. Let the Greek carve his lionsand the Goth his dragons: buffalo and wild deer are the animalsfor you.
Golden rod and aster and rose and all the flowers that cover yourvalleys in the spring and your hills in the autumn: let them bethe flowers for your art. Not merely has Nature given you thenoblest motives for a new school of decoration, but to you aboveall other countries has she given the utensils to work in.
You have quarries of marble richer than Pentelicus, more variedthan Paros, but do not build a great white square house of marbleand think that it is beautiful, or that you are using marble nobly.If you build in marble you must either carve it into joyousdecoration, like the lives of dancing children that adorn themarble castles of the Loire, or fill it with beautiful sculpture,frieze and pediment, as the Greeks did, or inlay it with othercoloured marbles as they did in Venice. Otherwise you had betterbuild in simple red brick as your Puritan fathers, with no pretenceand with some beauty. Do not treat your marble as if it wasordinary stone and build a house of mere blocks of it. For it isindeed a precious stone, this marble of yours, and only workmen ofnobility of invention and delicacy of hand should be allowed totouch it at all, carving it into noble statues or into beautifuldecoration, or inlaying it with other coloured marbles: for 'thetrue colours of architecture are those of natural stone, and Iwould fain see them taken advantage of to the full. Every varietyis here, from pale yellow to purple passing through orange, red,and brown, entirely at your command; nearly every kind of green andgrey also is attainable, and with these and with pure white whatharmony might you not achieve. Of stained and variegated stone thequantity is unlimited, the kinds innumerable. Were brightercolours required, let glass, and gold protected by glass, be usedin mosaic, a kind of work as durable as the solid stone andincapable of losing its lustre by time. And let the painter's workbe reserved for the shadowed loggia and inner chamber.
'This is the true and faithful way of building. Where this cannotbe, the device of external colouring may indeed be employed withoutdishonour - but it must be with the warning reflection that a timewill come when such aids will pass away and when the building willbe judged in its lifelessness, dying the death of the dolphin.Better the less bright, more enduring fabric. The transparentalabasters of San Miniato and the mosaics of Saint Mark's are morewarmly filled and more brightly touched by every return of morningand evening, while the hues of the Gothic cathedrals have died likethe iris out of the cloud, and the temples, whose azure and purpleonce flamed above the Grecian promontory, stand in their fadedwhiteness like snows which the sunset has left cold.' - Ruskin,SEVEN LAMPS OF ARCHITECTURE, II.
I do not know anything so perfectly commonplace in design as mostmodern jewellery. How easy for you to change that and to producegoldsmiths' work that would be a joy to all of us. The gold isready for you in unexhausted treasure, stored up in the mountainhollow or strewn on the river sand, and was not given to you merelyfor barren speculation. There should be some better record of itleft in your history than the merchant's panic and the ruined home.We do not remember often enough how constantly the history of agreat nation will live in and by its art. Only a few thin wreathsof beaten gold remain to tell us of the stately empire of Etruria;and, while from the streets of Florence the noble knight andhaughty duke have long since passed away, the gates which thesimple goldsmith Ghiberti made for their pleasure still guard theirlovely house of baptism, worthy still of the praise of MichaelAngelo who called them worthy to be the Gates of Paradise.
Have then your school of design, search out your workmen and, whenyou find one who has delicacy of hand and that wonder of inventionnecessary for goldsmiths' work, do not leave him to toil inobscurity and dishonour and have a great glaring shop and two greatglaring shop-boys in it (not to take your orders: they never dothat; but to force you to buy something you do not want at all).When you want a thing wrought in gold, goblet or shield for thefeast, necklace or wreath for the women, tell him what you likemost in decoration, flower or wreath, bird in flight or hound inthe chase, image of the woman you love or the friend you honour.Watch him as he beats out the gold into those thin plates delicateas the petals of a yellow rose, or draws it into the long wireslike tangled sunbeams at dawn. Whoever that workman be, help him,cherish him, and you will have such lovely work from his hand aswill be a joy to you for all time.
This is the spirit of our movement in England, and this is thespirit in which we would wish you to work, making eternal by yourart all that is noble in your men and women, stately in your lakesand mountains, beautiful in your own flowers and natural life. Wewant to see that you have nothing in your houses that has not beena joy to the man who made it, and is not a joy to those that useit. We want to see you create an art made by the hands of thepeople to please the hearts of the people too. Do you like thisspirit or not? Do you think it simple and strong, noble in itsaim, and beautiful in its result? I know you do.
Folly and slander have their own way for a little time, but for alittle time only. You now know what we mean: you will be able toestimate what is said of us - its value and its motive.
There should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be allowedto write about art. The harm they do by their foolish and randomwriting it would be impossible to overestimate - not to the artistbut to the public, blinding them to all, but harming the artist notat all. Without them we would judge a man simply by his work; butat present the newspapers are trying hard to induce the public tojudge a sculptor, for instance, never by his statues but by the wayhe treats his wife; a painter by the amount of his income and apoet by the colour of his neck-tie. I said there should be a law,but there is really no necessity for a new law: nothing could beeasier than to bring the ordinary critic under the head of thecriminal classes. But let us leave such an inartistic subject andreturn to beautiful and comely things, remembering that the artwhich would represent the spirit of modern newspapers would beexactly the art which you and I want to avoid - grotesque art,malice mocking you from every gateway, slander sneering at you fromevery corner.
Perhaps you may be surprised at my talking of labour and theworkman. You have heard of me, I fear, through the medium of yoursomewhat imaginative newspapers as, if not a 'Japanese young man,'at least a young man to whom the rush and clamour and reality ofthe modern world were distasteful, and whose greatest difficulty inlife was the difficulty of living up to the level of his blue china- a paradox from which England has not yet recovered.
Well, let me tell you how it first came to me at all to create anartistic movement in England, a movement to show the rich whatbeautiful things they might enjoy and the poor what beautifulthings they might create.
One summer afternoon in Oxford - 'that sweet city with her dreamingspires,' lovely as Venice in its splendour, noble in its learningas Rome, down the long High Street that winds from tower to tower,past silent cloister and stately gateway, till it reaches thatlong, grey seven-arched bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (usedto, I say, because they are now pulling it down to build a tramwayand a light cast-iron bridge in its place, desecrating theloveliest city in England) - well, we were coming down the street -a troop of young men, some of them like myself only nineteen, goingto river or tennis-court or cricket-field - when Ruskin going up tolecture in cap and gown met us. He seemed troubled and prayed usto go back with him to his lecture, which a few of us did, andthere he spoke to us not on art this time but on life, saying thatit seemed to him to be wrong that all the best physique andstrength of the young men in England should be spent aimlessly oncricket ground or river, without any result at all except that ifone rowed well one got a pewter-pot, and if one made a good score,a cane-handled bat. He thought, he said, that we should be workingat something that would do good to other people, at something bywhich we might show that in all labour there was something noble.Well, we were a good deal moved, and said we would do anything hewished. So he went out round Oxford and found two villages, Upperand Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a great swamp, sothat the villagers could not pass from one to the other withoutmany miles of a round. And when we came back in winter he asked usto help him to make a road across this morass for these villagepeople to use. So out we went, day after day, and learned how tolay levels and to break stones, and to wheel barrows along a plank- a very difficult thing to do. And Ruskin worked with us in themist and rain and mud of an Oxford winter, and our friends and ourenemies came out and mocked us from the bank. We did not mind itmuch then, and we did not mind it afterwards at all, but workedaway for two months at our road. And what became of the road?Well, like a bad lecture it ended abruptly - in the middle of theswamp. Ruskin going away to Venice, when we came back for the nextterm there was no leader, and the 'diggers,' as they called us,fell asunder. And I felt that if there was enough spirit amongstthe young men to go out to such work as road-making for the sake ofa noble ideal of life, I could from them create an artisticmovement that might change, as it has changed, the face of England.So I sought them out - leader they would call me - but there was noleader: we were all searchers only and we were bound to each otherby noble friendship and by noble art. There was none of us idle:poets most of us, so ambitious were we: painters some of us, orworkers in metal or modellers, determined that we would try andcreate for ourselves beautiful work: for the handicraftsmanbeautiful work, for those who love us poems and pictures, for thosewho love us not epigrams and paradoxes and scorn.
Well, we have done something in England and we will do somethingmore. Now, I do not want you, believe me, to ask your brilliantyoung men, your beautiful young girls, to go out and make a road ona swamp for any village in America, but I think you might each ofyou have some art to practise.
We must have, as Emerson said, a mechanical craft for our culture,a basis for our higher accomplishments in the work of our hands -the uselessness of most people's hands seems to me one of the mostunpractical things. 'No separation from labour can be without someloss of power or truth to the seer,' says Emerson again. Theheroism which would make on us the impression of Epaminondas mustbe that of a domestic conqueror. The hero of the future is he whoshall bravely and gracefully subdue this Gorgon of fashion and ofconvention.
When you have chosen your own part, abide by it, and do not weaklytry and reconcile yourself with the world. The heroic cannot bethe common nor the common the heroic. Congratulate yourself if youhave done something strange and extravagant and broken the monotonyof a decorous age.
And lastly, let us remember that art is the one thing which Deathcannot harm. The little house at Concord may be desolate, but thewisdom of New England's Plato is not silenced nor the brilliancy ofthat Attic genius dimmed: the lips of Longfellow are still musicalfor us though his dust be turning into the flowers which he loved:and as it is with the greater artists, poet and philosopher andsong-bird, so let it be with you.
