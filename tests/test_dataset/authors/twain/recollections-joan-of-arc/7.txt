She Delivers the Divine Command
I HEARD my name called. It was Joan's voice. It startled me, for howcould she know I was there? I said to myself, it is part of the dream; itis all dream--voice, vision and all; the fairies have done this. So Icrossed myself and pronounced the name of God, to break the enchantment.I knew I was awake now and free from the spell, for no spell canwithstand this exorcism. Then I heard my name called again, and I steppedat once from under cover, and there indeed was Joan, but not looking asshe had looked in the dream. For she was not crying now, but was lookingas she had used to look a year and a half before, when her heart waslight and her spirits high. Her old-time energy and fire were back, and asomething like exaltation showed itself in her face and bearing. It wasalmost as if she had been in a trance all that time and had come awakeagain. Really, it was just as if she had been away and lost, and was comeback to us at last; and I was so glad that I felt like running to calleverybody and have them flock around her and give her welcome. I ran toher excited and said:
"Ah, Joan, I've got such a wonderful thing to tell you about! You wouldnever imagine it. I've had a dream, and in the dream I saw you right herewhere you are standing now, and--"
But she put up her hand and said:
"It was not a dream."
It gave me a shock, and I began to feel afraid again.
"Not a dream?" I said, "how can you know about it, Joan?"
"Are you dreaming now?"
"I--I suppose not. I think I am not."
"Indeed you are not. I know you are not. And yow were not dreaming whenyou cut the mark in the tree."
I felt myself turning cold with fright, for now I knew of a certaintythat I had not been dreaming, but had really been in the presence of adread something not of this world. Then I remembered that my sinful feetwere upon holy ground--the ground where that celestial shadow had rested.I moved quickly away, smitten to the bones with fear. Joan followed, andsaid:
"Do not be afraid; indeed there is no need. Come with me. We will sit bythe spring and I will tell you all my secret."
When she was ready to begin, I checked her and said:
"First tell me this. You could not see me in the wood; how did you know Icut a mark in the tree?"
"Wait a little; I will soon come to that; then you will see."
"But tell me one thing now; what was that awful shadow that I saw?"
"I will tell you, but do not be disturbed; you are not in danger. It wasthe shadow of an archangel--Michael, the chief and lord of the armies ofheaven."
I could but cross myself and tremble for having polluted that ground withmy feet.
"You were not afraid, Joan? Did you see his face--did you see his form?"
"Yes; I was not afraid, because this was not the first time. I was afraidthe first time."
"When was that, Joan?"
"It is nearly three years ago now."
"So long? Have you seen him many times?"
"Yes, many times."
"It is this, then, that has changed you; it was this that made youthoughtful and not as you were before. I see it now. Why did you not tellus about it?"
"It was not permitted. It is permitted now, and soon I shall tell all.But only you, now. It must remain a secret for a few days still."
"Has none seen that white shadow before but me?"
"No one. It has fallen upon me before when you and others were present,but none could see it. To-day it has been otherwise, and I was told why;but it will not be visible again to any."
"It was a sign to me, then--and a sign with a meaning of some kind?"
"Yes, but I may not speak of that."
"Strange--that that dazzling light could rest upon an object before one'seyes and not be visible."
"With it comes speech, also. Several saints come, attended by myriads ofangels, and they speak to me; I hear their voices, but others do not.They are very dear to me--my Voices; that is what I call them to myself."
"Joan, what do they tell you?"
"All manner of things--about France, I mean."
"What things have they been used to tell you?"
She sighed, and said:
"Disasters--only disasters, and misfortunes, and humiliation. There wasnaught else to foretell."
"They spoke of them to you beforehand?" "Yes. So that I knew what wasgoing to happen before it happened. It made me grave--as you saw. Itcould not be otherwise. But always there was a word of hope, too. Morethan that: France was to be rescued, and made great and free again. Buthow and by whom--that was not told. Not until to-day." As she said thoselast words a sudden deep glow shone in her eyes, which I was to see theremany times in after-days when the bugles sounded the charge and learn tocall it the battle-light. Her breast heaved, and the color rose in herface. "But to-day I know. God has chosen the meanest of His creatures forthis work; and by His command, and in His protection, and by Hisstrength, not mine, I am to lead His armies, and win back France, and setthe crown upon the head of His servant that is Dauphin and shall beKing."
I was amazed, and said:
"You, Joan? You, a child, lead armies?"
"Yes. For one little moment or two the thought crushed me; for it is asyou say--I am only a child; a child and ignorant--ignorant of everythingthat pertains to war, and not fitted for the rough life of camps and thecompanionship of soldiers. But those weak moments passed; they will notcome again. I am enlisted, I will not turn back, God helping me, till theEnglish grip is loosed from the throat of France. My Voices have nevertold me lies, they have not lied to-day. They say I am to go to Robert deBaudricourt, governor of Vaucouleurs, and he will give me men-at-arms forescort and send me to the King. A year from now a blow will be struckwhich will be the beginning of the end, and the end will follow swiftly."
"Where will it be struck?"
"My Voices have not said; nor what will happen this present year, beforeit is struck. It is appointed me to strike it, that is all I know; andfollow it with others, sharp and swift, undoing in ten weeks England'slong years of costly labor, and setting the crown upon the Dauphin'shead--for such is God's will; my Voices have said it, and shall I doubtit? No; it will be as they have said, for they say only that which istrue."
These were tremendous sayings. They were impossibilities to my reason,but to my heart they rang true; and so, while my reason doubted, my heartbelieved--believed, and held fast to the belief from that day. PresentlyI said:
"Joan, I believe the things which you have said, and now I am glad that Iam to march with you to the great wars--that is, if it is with you I amto march when I go."
She looked surprised, and said:
"It is true that you will be with me when I go to the wars, but how didyou know?"
"I shall march with you, and so also will Jean and Pierre, but notJacques."
"All true--it is so ordered, as was revealed to me lately, but I did notknow until to-day that the marching would be with me, or that I shouldmarch at all. How did you know these things?"
I told her when it was that she had said them. But she did not rememberabout it. So then I knew that she had been asleep, or in a trance or anecstasy of some kind, at that time. She bade me keep these and the otherrevelations to myself for the present, and I said I would, and kept thefaith I promised.
None who met Joan that day failed to notice the change that had come overher. She moved and spoke with energy and decision; there was a strangenew fire in her eye, and also a something wholly new and remarkable inher carriage and in the set of her head. This new light in the eye andthis new bearing were born of the authority and leadership which had thisday been vested in her by the decree of God, and they asserted thatauthority as plainly as speech could have done it, yet withoutostentation or bravado. This calm consciousness of command, and calmunconscious outward expression of it, remained with her thenceforth untilher mission was accomplished.
Like the other villagers, she had always accorded me the deference due myrank; but now, without word said on either side, she and I changedplaces; she gave orders, not suggestions. I received them with thedeference due a superior, and obeyed them without comment. In the eveningshe said to me:
"I leave before dawn. No one will know it but you. I go to speak with thegovernor of Vaucouleurs as commanded, who will despise me and treat merudely, and perhaps refuse my prayer at this time. I go first to Burey,to persuade my uncle Laxart to go with me, it not being meet that I goalone. I may need you in Vaucouleurs; for if the governor will notreceive me I will dictate a letter to him, and so must have some one byme who knows the art of how to write and spell the words. You will gofrom here to-morrow in the afternoon, and remain in Vaucouleurs until Ineed you."
I said I would obey, and she went her way. You see how clear a head shehad, and what a just and level judgment. She did not order me to go withher; no, she would not subject her good name to gossiping remark. Sheknew that the governor, being a noble, would grant me, another noble,audience; but no, you see, she would not have that, either. A poorpeasant-girl presenting a petition through a young nobleman--how wouldthat look? She always protected her modesty from hurt; and so, forreward, she carried her good name unsmirched to the end. I knew what Imust do now, if I would have her approval: go to Vaucouleurs, keep out ofher sight, and be ready when wanted.
I went the next afternoon, and took an obscure lodging; the next day Icalled at the castle and paid my respects to the governor, who invited meto dine with him at noon of the following day. He was an ideal soldier ofthe time; tall, brawny, gray-headed, rough, full of strange oathsacquired here and there and yonder in the wars and treasured as if theywere decorations. He had been used to the camp all his life, and to hisnotion war was God's best gift to man. He had his steel cuirass on, andwore boots that came above his knees, and was equipped with a huge sword;and when I looked at this martial figure, and heard the marvelous oaths,and guessed how little of poetry and sentiment might be looked for inthis quarter, I hoped the little peasant-girl would not get the privilegeof confronting this battery, but would have to content herself with thedictated letter.
I came again to the castle the next day at noon, and was conducted to thegreat dining-hall and seated by the side of the governor at a small tablewhich was raised a couple of steps higher than the general table. At thesmall table sat several other guests besides myself, and at the generaltable sat the chief officers of the garrison. At the entrance door stooda guard of halberdiers, in morion and breastplate.
As for talk, there was but one topic, of course--the desperate situationof France. There was a rumor, some one said, that Salisbury was makingpreparations to march against Orleans. It raised a turmoil of excitedconversation, and opinions fell thick and fast. Some believed he wouldmarch at once, others that he could not accomplish the investment beforefall, others that the siege would be long, and bravely contested; butupon one thing all voices agreed: that Orleans must eventually fall, andwith it France. With that, the prolonged discussion ended, and there wassilence. Every man seemed to sink himself in his own thoughts, and toforget where he was. This sudden and profound stillness, where before hadbeen so much animation, was impressive and solemn. Now came a servant andwhispered something to the governor, who said:
"Would talk with me?"
"Yes, your Excellency."
"H'm! A strange idea, certainly. Bring them in."
It was Joan and her uncle Laxart. At the spectacle of the great peoplethe courage oozed out of the poor old peasant and he stopped midway andwould come no further, but remained there with his red nightcap crushedin his hands and bowing humbly here, there, and everywhere, stupefiedwith embarrassment and fear. But Joan came steadily forward, erect andself-possessed, and stood before the governor. She recognized me, but inno way indicated it. There was a buzz of admiration, even the governorcontributing to it, for I heard him mutter, "By God's grace, it is abeautiful creature!" He inspected her critically a moment or two, thensaid:
"Well, what is your errand, my child?"
"My message is to you, Robert de Baudricourt, governor of Vaucouleurs,and it is this: that you will send and tell the Dauphin to wait and notgive battle to his enemies, for God will presently send him help."
This strange speech amazed the company, and many murmured, "The pooryoung thing is demented." The governor scowled, and said:
"What nonsense is this? The King--or the Dauphin, as you call him--needsno message of that sort. He will wait, give yourself no uneasiness as tothat. What further do you desire to say to me?"
"This. To beg that you will give me an escort of men-at-arms and send meto the Dauphin."
"What for?"
"That he may make me his general, for it is appointed that I shall drivethe English out of France, and set the crown upon his head."
"What--you? Why, you are but a child!"
"Yet am I appointed to do it, nevertheless."
"Indeed! And when will all this happen?"
"Next year he will be crowned, and after that will remain master ofFrance."
There was a great and general burst of laughter, and when it had subsidedthe governor said:
"Who has sent you with these extravagant messages?"
"My Lord."
"What Lord?"
"The King of Heaven."
Many murmured, "Ah, poor thing, poor thing!" and others, "Ah, her mind isbut a wreck!" The governor hailed Laxart, and said:
"Harkye!--take this mad child home and whip her soundly. That is the bestcure for her ailment."
As Joan was moving away she turned and said, with simplicity:
"You refuse me the soldiers, I know not why, for it is my Lord that hascommanded you. Yes, it is He that has made the command; therefore I mustcome again, and yet again; then I shall have the men-at-arms."
There was a great deal of wondering talk, after she was gone; and theguards and servants passed the talk to the town, the town passed it tothe country; Domremy was already buzzing with it when we got back.
