"Is it THEM?"
And somebody trotting along with the gang wouldanswer back and say:
"You bet it is."
When we got to the house the street in front of itwas packed, and the three girls was standing in thedoor. Mary Jane WAS red-headed, but that don't makeno difference, she was most awful beautiful, and herface and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was soglad her uncles was come. The king he spread hisarms, and Marsy Jane she jumped for them, and thehare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they HAD it!Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy tosee them meet again at last and have such good times.
Then the king he hunched the duke private -- I seehim do it -- and then he looked around and see thecoffin, over in the corner on two chairs; so then himand the duke, with a hand across each other's shoul-der, and t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow andsolemn over there, everybody dropping back to givethem room, and all the talk and noise stopping, peoplesaying "Sh!" and all the men taking their hats off anddrooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.And when they got there they bent over and looked inthe coffin, and took one sight, and then they bust outa-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most;and then they put their arms around each other'snecks, and hung their chins over each other's shoul-ders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four, Inever see two men leak the way they done. And,mind you, everybody was doing the same; and theplace was that damp I never see anything like it.Then one of them got on one side of the coffin, andt'other on t'other side, and they kneeled down andrested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to prayall to themselves. Well, when it come to that itworked the crowd like you never see anything like it,and everybody broke down and went to sobbing rightout loud -- the poor girls, too; and every woman,nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a word,and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and thenput their hand on their head, and looked up towardsthe sky, with the tears running down, and then bustedout and went off sobbing and swabbing, and give thenext woman a show. I never see anything so dis-gusting.
Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes for-ward a little, and works himself up and slobbers out aspeech, all full of tears and flapdoodle about its beinga sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose thediseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after thelong journey of four thousand mile, but it's a trialthat's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sym-pathy and these holy tears, and so he thanks them outof his heart and out of his brother's heart, because outof their mouths they can't, words being too weak andcold, and all that kind of rot and slush, till it was justsickening; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to cry-ing fit to bust.
And the minute the words were out of his mouthsomebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer,and everybody joined in with all their might, and itjust warmed you up and made you feel as good aschurch letting out. Music is a good thing; and afterall that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshenup things so, and sound so honest and bully.
Then the king begins to work his jaw again, andsays how him and his nieces would be glad if a few ofthe main principal friends of the family would takesupper here with them this evening, and help set upwith the ashes of the diseased; and says if his poorbrother laying yonder could speak he knows who hewould name, for they was names that was very dear tohim, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he willname the same, to wit, as follows, vizz.: -- Rev. Mr.Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Mr. Ben Rucker,and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robin-son, and their wives, and the widow Bartley.
Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to theend of the town a-hunting together -- that is, I meanthe doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other world,and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bellwas away up to Louisville on business. But the restwas on hand, and so they all come and shook handswith the king and thanked him and talked to him; andthen they shook hands with the duke and didn't saynothing, but just kept a-smiling and bobbing theirheads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sortsof signs with his hands and said "Goo-goo -- goo-goo-goo" all the time, like a baby that can't talk.
So the king he blattered along, and managed toinquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town,by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little thingsthat happened one time or another in the town, or toGeorge's family, or to Peter. And he always let onthat Peter wrote him the things; but that was a lie:he got every blessed one of them out of that youngflathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.
Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her fatherleft behind, and the king he read it out loud and criedover it. It give the dwelling-house and three thousanddollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard(which was doing a good business), along with someother houses and land (worth about seven thousand),and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey andWilliam, and told where the six thousand cash was hiddown cellar. So these two frauds said they'd go andfetch it up, and have everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle. We shutthe cellar door behind us, and when they found thebag they spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovelysight, all them yaller-boys. My, the way the king'seyes did shine! He slaps the duke on the shoulderand says:
"Oh, THIS ain't bully nor noth'n! Oh, no, I reckonnot! Why, Biljy, it beats the Nonesuch, DON'T it?"
The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them through their fingers and letthem jingle down on the floor; and the king says:
"It ain't no use talkin'; bein' brothers to a richdead man and representatives of furrin heirs that's gotleft is the line for you and me, Bilge. Thish yercomes of trust'n to Providence. It's the best way, inthe long run. I've tried 'em all, and ther' ain't nobetter way."
Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile,and took it on trust; but no, they must count it. Sothey counts it, and it comes out four hundred andfifteen dollars short. Says the king:
"Dern him, I wonder what he done with that fourhundred and fifteen dollars?"
They worried over that awhile, and ransacked allaround for it. Then the duke says:
"Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely hemade a mistake -- I reckon that's the way of it. Thebest way's to let it go, and keep still about it. Wecan spare it."
"Oh, shucks, yes, we can SPARE it. I don't k'yernoth'n 'bout that -- it's the COUNT I'm thinkin' about.We want to be awful square and open and above-boardhere, you know. We want to lug this h-yer moneyup stairs and count it before everybody -- then ther'ain't noth'n suspicious. But when the dead man saysther's six thous'n dollars, you know, we don't wantto --"
"Hold on," says the duke. "Le's make up thedeffisit," and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out ofhis pocket.
"It's a most amaz'n' good idea, duke -- you HAVEgot a rattlin' clever head on you," says the king."Blest if the old Nonesuch ain't a heppin' us outagin," and HE begun to haul out yaller-jackets andstack them up.
It most busted them, but they made up the sixthousand clean and clear.
"Say," says the duke, "I got another idea. Le'sgo up stairs and count this money, and then take andGIVE IT TO THE GIRLS."
"Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It's the mostdazzling idea 'at ever a man struck. You have cert'nlygot the most astonishin' head I ever see. Oh, this isthe boss dodge, ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it. Let'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to --this 'll lay 'em out."
When we got up-stairs everybody gethered aroundthe table, and the king he counted it and stacked it up,three hundred dollars in a pile -- twenty elegant littlepiles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked theirchops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and Isee the king begin to swell himself up for anotherspeech. He says:
"Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder hasdone generous by them that's left behind in the vale ofsorrers. He has done generous by these yer poorlittle lambs that he loved and sheltered, and that's leftfatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowedhim knows that he would a done MORE generous by 'emif he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his dear Williamand me. Now, WOULDN'T he? Ther' ain't no question'bout it in MY mind. Well, then, what kind o' brotherswould it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time?And what kind o' uncles would it be that 'd rob -- yes,ROB -- sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so atsech a time? If I know William -- and I THINK I do --he -- well, I'll jest ask him." He turns around andbegins to make a lot of signs to the duke with hishands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catchhis meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing withall his might for joy, and hugs him about fifteen timesbefore he lets up. Then the king says, "I knowedit; I reckon THAT 'll convince anybody the way HE feelsabout it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner, take themoney -- take it ALL. It's the gift of him that laysyonder, cold but joyful."
Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lipwent for the duke, and then such another hugging andkissing I never see yet. And everybody crowded upwith the tears in their eyes, and most shook the handsoff of them frauds, saying all the time:
"You DEAR good souls! -- how LOVELY! -- how COULDyou!"
Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talkingabout the diseased again, and how good he was, andwhat a loss he was, and all that; and before long a bigiron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside,and stood a-listening and looking, and not saying any-thing; and nobody saying anything to him either,because the king was talking and they was all busylistening. The king was saying -- in the middle ofsomething he'd started in on --
"-- they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased.That's why they're invited here this evenin'; but to-morrow we want ALL to come -- everybody; for herespected everybody, he liked everybody, and so it'sfitten that his funeral orgies sh'd be public."
And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hearhimself talk, and every little while he fetched in hisfuneral orgies again, till the duke he couldn't stand itno more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,"OBSEQUIES, you old fool," and folds it up, and goesto goo-gooing and reaching it over people's heads tohim. The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket,and says:
"Poor William, afflicted as he is, his HEART'S aluzright. Asks me to invite everybody to come to thefuneral -- wants me to make 'em all welcome. But heneedn't a worried -- it was jest what I was at."
Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca'm, andgoes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every nowand then, just like he done before. And when hedone it the third time he says:
"I say orgies, not because it's the common term,because it ain't -- obsequies bein' the common term --but because orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain'tused in England no more now -- it's gone out. Wesay orgies now in England. Orgies is better, becauseit means the thing you're after more exact. It's aword that's made up out'n the Greek ORGO, outside,open, abroad; and the Hebrew JEESUM, to plant, coverup; hence inTER. So, you see, funeral orgies is anopen er public funeral."
He was the WORST I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face. Everybodywas shocked. Everybody says, "Why, DOCTOR!" andAbner Shackleford says:
"Why, Robinson, hain't you heard the news? Thisis Harvey Wilks."
The king he smiled eager, and shoved out hisflapper, and says:
"Is it my poor brother's dear good friend and phy-sician? I --"
"Keep your hands off of me!" says the doctor."YOU talk like an Englishman, DON'T you? It's theworst imitation I ever heard. YOU Peter Wilks'sbrother! You're a fraud, that's what you are!"
Well, how they all took on! They crowded aroundthe doctor and tried to quiet him down, and tried toexplain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd showed inforty ways that he WAS Harvey, and knowed every-body by name, and the names of the very dogs, andbegged and BEGGED him not to hurt Harvey's feelingsand the poor girl's feelings, and all that. But it warn'tno use; he stormed right along, and said any man thatpretended to be an Englishman and couldn't imitatethe lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and aliar. The poor girls was hanging to the king and cry-ing; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns onTHEM. He says:
"I was your father's friend, and I'm your friend;and I warn you as a friend, and an honest one thatwants to protect you and keep you out of harm andtrouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and havenothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with hisidiotic Greek and Hebrew, as he calls it. He is thethinnest kind of an impostor -- has come here with alot of empty names and facts which he picked upsomewheres, and you take them for PROOFS, and arehelped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here,who ought to know better. Mary Jane Wilks, youknow me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend,too. Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out --I BEG you to do it. Will you?"
Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but shewas handsome! She says:
"HERE is my answer." She hove up the bag ofmoney and put it in the king's hands, and says,"Take this six thousand dollars, and invest for meand my sisters any way you want to, and don't giveus no receipt for it."
Then she put her arm around the king on one side,and Susan and the hare-lip done the same on theother. Everybody clapped their hands and stompedon the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king heldup his head and smiled proud. The doctor says:
"All right; I wash MY hands of the matter. But Iwarn you all that a time 's coming when you're goingto feel sick whenever you think of this day." Andaway he went.
"All right, doctor," says the king, kinder mockinghim; "we'll try and get 'em to send for you;" whichmade them all laugh, and they said it was a primegood hit.
