Was this His coming! I had hoped to seeA scene of wondrous glory, as was toldOf some great God who in a rain of goldBroke open bars and fell on Danae:Or a dread vision as when SemeleSickening for love and unappeased desirePrayed to see God's clear body, and the fireCaught her brown limbs and slew her utterly:With such glad dreams I sought this holy place,And now with wondering eyes and heart I standBefore this supreme mystery of Love:Some kneeling girl with passionless pale face,An angel with a lily in his hand,And over both the white wings of a Dove.
FLORENCE.
