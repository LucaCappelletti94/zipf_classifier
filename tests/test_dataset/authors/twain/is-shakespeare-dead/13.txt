Isn't it odd, when you think of it: that you may list all thecelebrated Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen of modern times,clear back to the first Tudors--a list containing five hundrednames, shall we say?--and you can go to the histories, biographiesand cyclopedias and learn the particulars of the lives of every oneof them. Every one of them except one--the most famous, the mostrenowned--by far the most illustrious of them all--Shakespeare!You can get the details of the lives of all the celebratedecclesiastics in the list; all the celebrated tragedians,comedians, singers, dancers, orators, judges, lawyers, poets,dramatists, historians, biographers, editors, inventors, reformers,statesmen, generals, admirals, discoverers, prize-fighters,murderers, pirates, conspirators, horse-jockeys, bunco-steerers,misers, swindlers, explorers, adventurers by land and sea, bankers,financiers, astronomers, naturalists, Claimants, impostors,chemists, biologists, geologists, philologists, college presidentsand professors, architects, engineers, painters, sculptors,politicians, agitators, rebels, revolutionists, patriots,demagogues, clowns, cooks, freaks, philosophers, burglars,highwaymen, journalists, physicians, surgeons--you can get thelife-histories of all of them but ONE. Just one--the mostextraordinary and the most celebrated of them all--Shakespeare!
You may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons furnishedby the rest of Christendom in the past four centuries, and you canfind out the life-histories of all those people, too. You willthen have listed 1500 celebrities, and you can trace the authenticlife-histories of the whole of them. Save one--far and away themost colossal prodigy of the entire accumulation--Shakespeare!About him you can find out NOTHING. Nothing of even the slightestimportance. Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in yourmemory. Nothing that even remotely indicates that he was everanything more than a distinctly common-place person--a manager, anactor of inferior grade, a small trader in a small village that didnot regard him as a person of any consequence, and had forgottenall about him before he was fairly cold in his grave. We can go tothe records and find out the life-history of every renowned RACE-HORSE of modern times--but not Shakespeare's! There are manyreasons why, and they have been furnished in cartloads (of guessand conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that isworth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is abundantlysufficient all by itself--HE HADN'T ANY HISTORY TO RECORD. Thereis no way of getting around that deadly fact. And no sane way hasyet been discovered of getting around its formidable significance.
Its quite plain significance--to any but those thugs (I do not usethe term unkindly) is, that Shakespeare had no prominence while helived, and none until he had been dead two or three generations.The Plays enjoyed high fame from the beginning; and if he wrotethem it seems a pity the world did not find it out. He ought tohave explained that he was the author, and not merely a nom deplume for another man to hide behind. If he had been lessintemperately solicitous about his bones, and more solicitous abouthis Works, it would have been better for his good name, and akindness to us. The bones were not important. They will moulderaway, they will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until thelast sun goes down.

P.S. March 25. About two months ago I was illuminating thisAutobiography with some notions of mine concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, and I then took occasion to air theopinion that the Stratford Shakespeare was a person of no publicconsequence or celebrity during his lifetime, but was utterlyobscure and unimportant. And not only in great London, but also inthe little village where he was born, where he lived a quarter of acentury, and where he died and was buried. I argued that if he hadbeen a person of any note at all, aged villagers would have hadmuch to tell about him many and many a year after his death,instead of being unable to furnish inquirers a single factconnected with him. I believed, and I still believe, that if hehad been famous, his notoriety would have lasted as long as minehas lasted in my native village out in Missouri. It is a goodargument, a prodigiously strong one, and a most formidable one foreven the most gifted, and ingenious, and plausible Stratfordolaterto get around or explain away. To-day a Hannibal Courier-Post ofrecent date has reached me, with an article in it which reinforcesmy contention that a really celebrated person cannot be forgottenin his village in the short space of sixty years. I will make anextract from it:
Hannibal, as a city, may have many sins to answer for, butingratitude is not one of them, or reverence for the great men shehas produced, and as the years go by her greatest son Mark Twain,or S. L. Clemens as a few of the unlettered call him, grows in theestimation and regard of the residents of the town he made famousand the town that made him famous. His name is associated withevery old building that is torn down to make way for the modernstructures demanded by a rapidly growing city, and with every hillor cave over or through which he might by any possibility haveroamed, while the many points of interest which he wove into hisstories, such as Holiday Hill, Jackson's Island, or Mark TwainCave, are now monuments to his genius. Hannibal is glad of anyopportunity to do him honor as he has honored her.
So it has happened that the "old timers" who went to school withMark or were with him on some of his usual escapades have beenhonored with large audiences whenever they were in a reminiscentmood and condescended to tell of their intimacy with the ordinaryboy who came to be a very extraordinary humorist and whose everyboyish act is now seen to have been indicative of what was to come.Like Aunt Beckey and Mrs. Clemens, they can now see that Mark washardly appreciated when he lived here and that the things he did asa boy and was whipped for doing were not all bad after all. Sothey have been in no hesitancy about drawing out the bad things hedid as well as the good in their efforts to get a "Mark Twainstory," all incidents being viewed in the light of his presentfame, until the volume of "Twainiana" is already considerable andgrowing in proportion as the "old timers" drop away and the storiesare retold second and third hand by their descendants. With someseventy-three years young and living in a villa instead of a househe is a fair target, and let him incorporate, copyright, or patenthimself as he will, there are some of his "works" that will goswooping up Hannibal chimneys as long as gray-beards gather aboutthe fires and begin with "I've heard father tell" or possibly "Oncewhen I."
The Mrs. Clemens referred to is my mother--WAS my mother.
And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper. Of date twentydays ago:
Miss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William Dickason, 408Rock Street, at 2.30 o'clock yesterday afternoon, aged 72 years.The deceased was a sister of "Huckleberry Finn," one of the famouscharacters in Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer. She had been a member ofthe Dickason family--the housekeeper--for nearly forty-five years,and was a highly respected lady. For the past eight years she hadbeen an invalid, but was as well cared for by Mr. Dickason and hisfamily as if she had been a near relative. She was a member of thePark Methodist Church and a Christian woman.
I remember her well. I have a picture of her in my mind which wasgraven there, clear and sharp and vivid, sixty-three years ago.She was at that time nine years old, and I was about eleven. Iremember where she stood, and how she looked; and I can still seeher bare feet, her bare head, her brown face, and her short tow-linen frock. She was crying. What it was about, I have long agoforgotten. But it was the tears that preserved the picture for me,no doubt. She was a good child, I can say that for her. She knewme nearly seventy years ago. Did she forget me, in the course oftime? I think not. If she had lived in Stratford in Shakespeare'stime, would she have forgotten him? Yes. For he was never famousduring his lifetime, he was utterly obscure in Stratford, and therewouldn't be any occasion to remember him after he had been dead aweek.
"Injun Joe," "Jimmy Finn," and "General Gaines" were prominent andvery intemperate ne'er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago.Plenty of gray-heads there remember them to this day, and can tellyou about them. Isn't it curious that two "town-drunkards" and onehalf-breed loafer should leave behind them, in a remote Missourianvillage, a fame a hundred times greater and several hundred timesmore particularized in the matter of definite facts thanShakespeare left behind him in the village where he had lived thehalf of his lifetime?
