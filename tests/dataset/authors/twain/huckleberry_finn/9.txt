This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridgeabout forty foot high. We had a rough time gettingto the top, the sides was so steep and the bushes sothick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, andby and by found a good big cavern in the rock, mostup to the top on the side towards Illinois. The cavernwas as big as two or three rooms bunched together,and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool inthere. Jim was for putting our traps in there rightaway, but I said we didn't want to be climbing up anddown there all the time.
Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place,and had all the traps in the cavern, we could rush thereif anybody was to come to the island, and they wouldnever find us without dogs. And, besides, he saidthem little birds had said it was going to rain, and didI want the things to get wet?
So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled upabreast the cavern, and lugged all the traps up there.Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoein, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish offof the lines and set them again, and begun to get readyfor dinner.
The door of the cavern was big enough to roll ahogshead in, and on one side of the door the floorstuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good place tobuild a fire on. So we built it there and cookeddinner.
We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eatour dinner in there. We put all the other things handyat the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it darkened up,and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds wasright about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rainedlike all fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so.It was one of these regular summer storms. It wouldget so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, andlovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thickthat the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind thatwould bend the trees down and turn up the pale under-side of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gustwould follow along and set the branches to tossingtheir arms as if they was just wild; and next, when itwas just about the bluest and blackest -- FST! it was asbright as glory, and you'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,hundreds of yards further than you could see before;dark as sin again in a second, and now you'd hear thethunder let go with an awful crash, and then go rum-bling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards theunder side of the world, like rolling empty barrelsdown stairs -- where it's long stairs and they bounce agood deal, you know.
"Jim, this is nice," I says. "I wouldn't want tobe nowhere else but here. Pass me along anotherhunk of fish and some hot corn-bread."
"Well, you wouldn't a ben here 'f it hadn't a benfor Jim. You'd a ben down dah in de woods widoutany dinner, en gittn' mos' drownded, too; dat youwould, honey. Chickens knows when it's gwyne torain, en so do de birds, chile."
The river went on raising and raising for ten ortwelve days, till at last it was over the banks. Thewater was three or four foot deep on the island in thelow places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side itwas a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri sideit was the same old distance across -- a half a mile --because the Missouri shore was just a wall of highbluffs.
Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe,It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods, evenif the sun was blazing outside. We went winding inand out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vineshung so thick we had to back away and go some otherway. Well, on every old broken-down tree you couldsee rabbits and snakes and such things; and whenthe island had been overflowed a day or two they gotso tame, on account of being hungry, that you couldpaddle right up and put your hand on them if youwanted to; but not the snakes and turtles -- they wouldslide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was inwas full of them. We could a had pets enough if we'dwanted them.
One night we catched a little section of a lumberraft -- nice pine planks. It was twelve foot wide andabout fifteen or sixteen foot long, and the top stoodabove water six or seven inches -- a solid, level floor.We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight some-times, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselvesin daylight.
Another night when we was up at the head of theisland, just before daylight, here comes a frame-housedown, on the west side. She was a two-story, andtilted over considerable. We paddled out and gotaboard -- clumb in at an upstairs window. But it wastoo dark to see yet, so we made the canoe fast and setin her to wait for daylight.
The light begun to come before we got to the footof the island. Then we looked in at the window. Wecould make out a bed, and a table, and two old chairs,and lots of things around about on the floor, and therewas clothes hanging against the wall. There wassomething laying on the floor in the far corner thatlooked like a man. So Jim says:
"Hello, you!"
But it didn't budge. So I hollered again, and thenJim says:
"De man ain't asleep -- he's dead. You hold still-- I'll go en see."
He went, and bent down and looked, and says:
"It's a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too.He's ben shot in de back. I reck'n he's ben deadtwo er three days. Come in, Huck, but doan' look athis face -- it's too gashly."
I didn't look at him at all. Jim throwed some oldrags over him, but he needn't done it; I didn't wantto see him. There was heaps of old greasy cardsscattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; andall over the walls was the ignorantest kind of wordsand pictures made with charcoal. There was two olddirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and somewomen's underclothes hanging against the wall, andsome men's clothing, too. We put the lot into thecanoe -- it might come good. There was a boy's oldspeckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and ithad a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would atook the bottle, but it was broke. There was a seedyold chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.They stood open, but there warn't nothing left in themthat was any account. The way things was scatteredabout we reckoned the people left in a hurry, andwarn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.
We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife with-out any handle, and a bran-new Barlow knife worthtwo bits in any store, and a lot of tallow candles, and atin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a rattyold bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needlesand pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and allsuch truck in it, and a hatchet and some nails, and afishline as thick as my little finger with some mon-strous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and aleather dog-collar, and a horseshoe, and some vials ofmedicine that didn't have no label on them; and justas we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a woodenleg. The straps was broke off of it, but, barring that,it was a good enough leg, though it was too long forme and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't findthe other one, though we hunted all around.
And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of amile below the island, and it was pretty broad day; soI made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up withthe quilt, because if he set up people could tell he wasa nigger a good ways off. I paddled over to theIllinois shore, and drifted down most a half a miledoing it. I crept up the dead water under the bank,and hadn't no accidents and didn't see nobody. Wegot home all safe.
