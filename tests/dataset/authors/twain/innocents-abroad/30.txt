 ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.
"See Naples and die." Well, I do not know that one would necessarily dieafter merely seeing it, but to attempt to live there might turn out alittle differently. To see Naples as we saw it in the early dawn fromfar up on the side of Vesuvius, is to see a picture of wonderful beauty.At that distance its dingy buildings looked white--and so, rank on rankof balconies, windows and roofs, they piled themselves up from the blueocean till the colossal castle of St. Elmo topped the grand white pyramidand gave the picture symmetry, emphasis and completeness. And when itslilies turned to roses--when it blushed under the sun's first kiss--itwas beautiful beyond all description. One might well say, then, "SeeNaples and die." The frame of the picture was charming, itself. Infront, the smooth sea--a vast mosaic of many colors; the lofty islandsswimming in a dreamy haze in the distance; at our end of the city thestately double peak of Vesuvius, and its strong black ribs and seams oflava stretching down to the limitless level campagna--a green carpet thatenchants the eye and leads it on and on, past clusters of trees, andisolated houses, and snowy villages, until it shreds out in a fringe ofmist and general vagueness far away. It is from the Hermitage, there onthe side of Vesuvius, that one should "see Naples and die."
But do not go within the walls and look at it in detail. That takes awaysome of the romance of the thing. The people are filthy in their habits,and this makes filthy streets and breeds disagreeable sights and smells.There never was a community so prejudiced against the cholera as theseNeapolitans are. But they have good reason to be. The cholera generallyvanquishes a Neapolitan when it seizes him, because, you understand,before the doctor can dig through the dirt and get at the disease the mandies. The upper classes take a sea-bath every day, and are prettydecent.
The streets are generally about wide enough for one wagon, and how theydo swarm with people! It is Broadway repeated in every street, in everycourt, in every alley! Such masses, such throngs, such multitudes ofhurrying, bustling, struggling humanity! We never saw the like of it,hardly even in New York, I think. There are seldom any sidewalks, andwhen there are, they are not often wide enough to pass a man on withoutcaroming on him. So everybody walks in the street--and where the streetis wide enough, carriages are forever dashing along. Why a thousandpeople are not run over and crippled every day is a mystery that no mancan solve. But if there is an eighth wonder in the world, it must be thedwelling-houses of Naples. I honestly believe a good majority of themare a hundred feet high! And the solid brick walls are seven feetthrough. You go up nine flights of stairs before you get to the "first"floor. No, not nine, but there or thereabouts. There is a littlebird-cage of an iron railing in front of every window clear away up, up,up, among the eternal clouds, where the roof is, and there is alwayssomebody looking out of every window--people of ordinary size lookingout from the first floor, people a shade smaller from the second, peoplethat look a little smaller yet from the third--and from thence upwardthey grow smaller and smaller by a regularly graduated diminution, tillthe folks in the topmost windows seem more like birds in an uncommonlytall martin-box than any thing else. The perspective of one of thesenarrow cracks of streets, with its rows of tall houses stretching awaytill they come together in the distance like railway tracks; itsclothes-lines crossing over at all altitudes and waving their banneredraggedness over the swarms of people below; and the white-dressed womenperched in balcony railings all the way from the pavement up to theheavens--a perspective like that is really worth going into Neapolitandetails to see.

Naples, with its immediate suburbs, contains six hundred and twenty-fivethousand inhabitants, but I am satisfied it covers no more ground than anAmerican city of one hundred and fifty thousand. It reaches up into theair infinitely higher than three American cities, though, and there iswhere the secret of it lies. I will observe here, in passing, that thecontrasts between opulence and poverty, and magnificence and misery, aremore frequent and more striking in Naples than in Paris even. One mustgo to the Bois de Boulogne to see fashionable dressing, splendidequipages and stunning liveries, and to the Faubourg St. Antoine to seevice, misery, hunger, rags, dirt--but in the thoroughfares of Naplesthese things are all mixed together. Naked boys of nine years and thefancy-dressed children of luxury; shreds and tatters, and brilliantuniforms; jackass-carts and state-carriages; beggars, Princes andBishops, jostle each other in every street. At six o'clock everyevening, all Naples turns out to drive on the 'Riviere di Chiaja',(whatever that may mean;) and for two hours one may stand there and seethe motliest and the worst mixed procession go by that ever eyes beheld.Princes (there are more Princes than policemen in Naples--the city isinfested with them)--Princes who live up seven flights of stairs anddon't own any principalities, will keep a carriage and go hungry; andclerks, mechanics, milliners and strumpets will go without their dinnersand squander the money on a hack-ride in the Chiaja; the rag-tag andrubbish of the city stack themselves up, to the number of twenty orthirty, on a rickety little go-cart hauled by a donkey not much biggerthan a cat, and they drive in the Chiaja; Dukes and bankers, in sumptuouscarriages and with gorgeous drivers and footmen, turn out, also, and sothe furious procession goes. For two hours rank and wealth, andobscurity and poverty clatter along side by side in the wild procession,and then go home serene, happy, covered with glory!
I was looking at a magnificent marble staircase in the King's palace, theother day, which, it was said, cost five million francs, and I suppose itdid cost half a million, may be. I felt as if it must be a fine thing tolive in a country where there was such comfort and such luxury as this.And then I stepped out musing, and almost walked over a vagabond who waseating his dinner on the curbstone--a piece of bread and a bunch ofgrapes. When I found that this mustang was clerking in a fruitestablishment (he had the establishment along with him in a basket,) attwo cents a day, and that he had no palace at home where he lived, I lostsome of my enthusiasm concerning the happiness of living in Italy.
This naturally suggests to me a thought about wages here. Lieutenants inthe army get about a dollar a day, and common soldiers a couple of cents.I only know one clerk--he gets four dollars a month. Printers get sixdollars and a half a month, but I have heard of a foreman who getsthirteen.
To be growing suddenly and violently rich, as this man is, naturallymakes him a bloated aristocrat. The airs he puts on are insufferable.
And, speaking of wages, reminds me of prices of merchandise. In Parisyou pay twelve dollars a dozen for Jouvin's best kid gloves; gloves ofabout as good quality sell here at three or four dollars a dozen. Youpay five and six dollars apiece for fine linen shirts in Paris; here andin Leghorn you pay two and a half. In Marseilles you pay forty dollarsfor a first-class dress coat made by a good tailor, but in Leghorn youcan get a full dress suit for the same money. Here you get handsomebusiness suits at from ten to twenty dollars, and in Leghorn you can getan overcoat for fifteen dollars that would cost you seventy in New York.Fine kid boots are worth eight dollars in Marseilles and four dollarshere. Lyons velvets rank higher in America than those of Genoa. Yet thebulk of Lyons velvets you buy in the States are made in Genoa andimported into Lyons, where they receive the Lyons stamp and are thenexported to America. You can buy enough velvet in Genoa for twenty-fivedollars to make a five hundred dollar cloak in New York--so the ladiestell me. Of course these things bring me back, by a natural and easytransition, to the
 ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.
And thus the wonderful Blue Grotto is suggested to me. It is situated onthe Island of Capri, twenty-two miles from Naples. We chartered a littlesteamer and went out there. Of course, the police boarded us and put usthrough a health examination, and inquired into our politics, before theywould let us land. The airs these little insect Governments put on arein the last degree ridiculous. They even put a policeman on board of ourboat to keep an eye on us as long as we were in the Capri dominions.They thought we wanted to steal the grotto, I suppose. It was worthstealing. The entrance to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide,and is in the face of a lofty perpendicular cliff--the sea-wall. Youenter in small boats--and a tight squeeze it is, too. You can not go inat all when the tide is up. Once within, you find yourself in an archedcavern about one hundred and sixty feet long, one hundred and twentywide, and about seventy high. How deep it is no man knows. It goes downto the bottom of the ocean. The waters of this placid subterranean lakeare the brightest, loveliest blue that can be imagined. They are astransparent as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the richestsky that ever bent over Italy. No tint could be more ravishing, nolustre more superb. Throw a stone into the water, and the myriad of tinybubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatricalfires. Dip an oar, and its blade turns to splendid frosted silver,tinted with blue. Let a man jump in, and instantly he is cased in anarmor more gorgeous than ever kingly Crusader wore.
Then we went to Ischia, but I had already been to that island and tiredmyself to death "resting" a couple of days and studying human villainy,with the landlord of the Grande Sentinelle for a model. So we went toProcida, and from thence to Pozzuoli, where St. Paul landed after hesailed from Samos. I landed at precisely the same spot where St. Paullanded, and so did Dan and the others. It was a remarkable coincidence.St. Paul preached to these people seven days before he started to Rome.
Nero's Baths, the ruins of Baiae, the Temple of Serapis; Cumae, where theCumaen Sybil interpreted the oracles, the Lake Agnano, with its ancientsubmerged city still visible far down in its depths--these and a hundredother points of interest we examined with critical imbecility, but theGrotto of the Dog claimed our chief attention, because we had heard andread so much about it. Every body has written about the Grotto del Caneand its poisonous vapors, from Pliny down to Smith, and every tourist hasheld a dog over its floor by the legs to test the capabilities of theplace. The dog dies in a minute and a half--a chicken instantly. As ageneral thing, strangers who crawl in there to sleep do not get up untilthey are called. And then they don't either. The stranger that venturesto sleep there takes a permanent contract. I longed to see this grotto.I resolved to take a dog and hold him myself; suffocate him a little, andtime him; suffocate him some more and then finish him. We reached thegrotto at about three in the afternoon, and proceeded at once to make theexperiments. But now, an important difficulty presented itself. We hadno dog.
 ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.
At the Hermitage we were about fifteen or eighteen hundred feet above thesea, and thus far a portion of the ascent had been pretty abrupt. Forthe next two miles the road was a mixture--sometimes the ascent wasabrupt and sometimes it was not: but one characteristic it possessed allthe time, without failure--without modification--it was alluncompromisingly and unspeakably infamous. It was a rough, narrow trail,and led over an old lava flow--a black ocean which was tumbled into athousand fantastic shapes--a wild chaos of ruin, desolation, andbarrenness--a wilderness of billowy upheavals, of furious whirlpools, ofminiature mountains rent asunder--of gnarled and knotted, wrinkled andtwisted masses of blackness that mimicked branching roots, great vines,trunks of trees, all interlaced and mingled together: and all these weirdshapes, all this turbulent panorama, all this stormy, far-stretchingwaste of blackness, with its thrilling suggestiveness of life, of action,of boiling, surging, furious motion, was petrified!--all stricken deadand cold in the instant of its maddest rioting!--fettered, paralyzed, andleft to glower at heaven in impotent rage for evermore!
Finally we stood in a level, narrow valley (a valley that had beencreated by the terrific march of some old time irruption) and on eitherhand towered the two steep peaks of Vesuvius. The one we had to climb--the one that contains the active volcano--seemed about eight hundred orone thousand feet high, and looked almost too straight-up-and-down forany man to climb, and certainly no mule could climb it with a man on hisback. Four of these native pirates will carry you to the top in a sedanchair, if you wish it, but suppose they were to slip and let you fall,--is it likely that you would ever stop rolling? Not this side ofeternity, perhaps. We left the mules, sharpened our finger-nails, andbegan the ascent I have been writing about so long, at twenty minutes tosix in the morning. The path led straight up a rugged sweep of loosechunks of pumice-stone, and for about every two steps forward we took, weslid back one. It was so excessively steep that we had to stop, everyfifty or sixty steps, and rest a moment. To see our comrades, we had tolook very nearly straight up at those above us, and very nearly straightdown at those below. We stood on the summit at last--it had taken anhour and fifteen minutes to make the trip.
What we saw there was simply a circular crater--a circular ditch, if youplease--about two hundred feet deep, and four or five hundred feet wide,whose inner wall was about half a mile in circumference. In the centreof the great circus ring thus formed, was a torn and ragged upheaval ahundred feet high, all snowed over with a sulphur crust of many and manya brilliant and beautiful color, and the ditch inclosed this like themoat of a castle, or surrounded it as a little river does a littleisland, if the simile is better. The sulphur coating of that island wasgaudy in the extreme--all mingled together in the richest confusion werered, blue, brown, black, yellow, white--I do not know that there was acolor, or shade of a color, or combination of colors, unrepresented--andwhen the sun burst through the morning mists and fired this tintedmagnificence, it topped imperial Vesuvius like a jeweled crown!
The crater itself--the ditch--was not so variegated in coloring, but yet,in its softness, richness, and unpretentious elegance, it was morecharming, more fascinating to the eye. There was nothing "loud" aboutits well-bred and well-creased look. Beautiful? One could stand andlook down upon it for a week without getting tired of it. It had thesemblance of a pleasant meadow, whose slender grasses and whose velvetymosses were frosted with a shining dust, and tinted with palest greenthat deepened gradually to the darkest hue of the orange leaf, anddeepened yet again into gravest brown, then faded into orange, then intobrightest gold, and culminated in the delicate pink of a new-blown rose.Where portions of the meadow had sunk, and where other portions had beenbroken up like an ice-floe, the cavernous openings of the one, and theragged upturned edges exposed by the other, were hung with a lace-work ofsoft-tinted crystals of sulphur that changed their deformities intoquaint shapes and figures that were full of grace and beauty.
The walls of the ditch were brilliant with yellow banks of sulphur andwith lava and pumice-stone of many colors. No fire was visible anywhere, but gusts of sulphurous steam issued silently and invisibly from athousand little cracks and fissures in the crater, and were wafted to ournoses with every breeze. But so long as we kept our nostrils buried inour handkerchiefs, there was small danger of suffocation.
Some of the boys thrust long slips of paper down into holes and set themon fire, and so achieved the glory of lighting their cigars by the flamesof Vesuvius, and others cooked eggs over fissures in the rocks and werehappy.
The view from the summit would have been superb but for the fact that thesun could only pierce the mists at long intervals. Thus the glimpses wehad of the grand panorama below were only fitful and unsatisfactory.
 THE DESCENT.
The descent of the mountain was a labor of only four minutes. Instead ofstalking down the rugged path we ascended, we chose one which was beddedknee-deep in loose ashes, and ploughed our way with prodigious stridesthat would almost have shamed the performance of him of the seven-leagueboots.
The Vesuvius of today is a very poor affair compared to the mightyvolcano of Kilauea, in the Sandwich Islands, but I am glad I visited it.It was well worth it.
It is said that during one of the grand eruptions of Vesuvius itdischarged massy rocks weighing many tons a thousand feet into the air,its vast jets of smoke and steam ascended thirty miles toward thefirmament, and clouds of its ashes were wafted abroad and fell upon thedecks of ships seven hundred and fifty miles at sea! I will take theashes at a moderate discount, if any one will take the thirty miles ofsmoke, but I do not feel able to take a commanding interest in the wholestory by myself.
