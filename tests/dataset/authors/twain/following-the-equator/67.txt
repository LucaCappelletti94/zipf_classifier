First catch your Boer, then kick him. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

Those latter days were days of bitter worry and trouble for the harassedReformers.
From Mrs. Hammond we learn that on the 31st (the day after Johannesburgheard of the invasion), "The Reform Committee repudiates Dr. Jameson'sinroad."
It also publishes its intention to adhere to the Manifesto.
It also earnestly desires that the inhabitants shall refrain from overtacts against the Boer government.
It also "distributes arms" at the Court House, and furnishes horses "tothe newly-enrolled volunteers."
It also brings a Transvaal flag into the committee-room, and the entirebody swear allegiance to it "with uncovered heads and upraised arms."
Also "one thousand Lee-Metford rifles have been given out"--to rebels.
Also, in a speech, Reformer Lionel Phillips informs the public that theReform Committee Delegation has "been received with courtesy by theGovernment Commission," and "been assured that their proposals shall beearnestly considered."  That "while the Reform Committee regrettedJameson's precipitate action, they would stand by him."
Also the populace are in a state of "wild enthusiasm," and "46 canscarcely be restrained; they want to go out to meet Jameson and bring himin with triumphal outcry."
Also the British High Commissioner has issued a damnifying proclamationagainst Jameson and all British abettors of his game.  It arrives January1st.
It is a difficult position for the Reformers, and full of hindrances andperplexities.  Their duty is hard, but plain:
1.  They have to repudiate the inroad, and stand by the inroader.
2.  They have to swear allegiance to the Boer government, and distributecavalry horses to the rebels.
3.  They have to forbid overt acts against the Boer government, anddistribute arms to its enemies.
4.  They have to avoid collision with the British government, but stillstand by Jameson and their new oath of allegiance to the Boer government,taken, uncovered, in presence of its flag.
They did such of these things as they could; they tried to do them all;in fact, did do them all, but only in turn, not simultaneously.  In thenature of things they could not be made to simultane.
In preparing for armed revolution and in talking revolution, were theReformers "bluffing," or were they in earnest?  If they were in earnest,they were taking great risks--as has been already pointed out.  Agentleman of high position told me in Johannesburg that he had in hispossession a printed document proclaiming a new government and naming itspresident--one of the Reform leaders.  He said that this proclamation hadbeen ready for issue, but was suppressed when the raid collapsed.Perhaps I misunderstood him.  Indeed, I must have misunderstood him, forI have not seen mention of this large incident in print anywhere.
Besides, I hope I am mistaken; for, if I am, then there is argument thatthe Reformers were privately not serious, but were only trying to scarethe Boer government into granting the desired reforms.
The Boer government was scared, and it had a right to be.  For if Mr.Rhodes's plan was to provoke a collision that would compel theinterference of England, that was a serious matter.  If it could be shownthat that was also the Reformers' plan and purpose, it would prove thatthey had marked out a feasible project, at any rate, although it was onewhich could hardly fail to cost them ruinously before England shouldarrive.  But it seems clear that they had no such plan nor desire.  If,when the worst should come to the worst, they meant to overthrow thegovernment, they also meant to inherit the assets themselves, no doubt.
This scheme could hardly have succeeded.  With an army of Boers at theirgates and 50,000 riotous blacks in their midst, the odds against successwould have been too heavy--even if the whole town had been armed.  Withonly 2,500 rifles in the place, they stood really no chance.
To me, the military problems of the situation are of more interest thanthe political ones, because by disposition I have always been especiallyfond of war.  No, I mean fond of discussing war; and fond of givingmilitary advice.  If I had been with Jameson the morning after hestarted, I should have advised him to turn back.  That was Monday; it wasthen that he received his first warning from a Boer source not to violatethe friendly soil of the Transvaal.  It showed that his invasion wasknown.  If I had been with him on Tuesday morning and afternoon, when hereceived further warnings, I should have repeated my advice.  If I hadbeen with him the next morning--New Year's--when he received notice that"a few hundred" Boers were waiting for him a few miles ahead, I shouldnot have advised, but commanded him to go back.  And if I had been withhim two or three hours later--a thing not conceivable to me--I shouldhave retired him by force; for at that time he learned that the fewhundred had now grown to 800; and that meant that the growing would go ongrowing.
For,--by authority of Mr. Garrett, one knows that Jameson's 600 were only530 at most, when you count out his native drivers, etc.; and that the530 consisted largely of "green" youths, "raw young fellows," not trainedand war-worn British soldiers; and I would have told.  Jameson that thoselads would not be able to shoot effectively from horseback in the scamperand racket of battle, and that there would not be anything for them toshoot at, anyway, but rocks; for the Boers would be behind the rocks, notout in the open.  I would have told him that 300 Boer sharpshootersbehind rocks would be an overmatch for his 500 raw young fellows onhorseback.
If pluck were the only thing essential to battle-winning, the Englishwould lose no battles.  But discretion, as well as pluck, is requiredwhen one fights Boers and Red Indians.  In South Africa the Briton hasalways insisted upon standing bravely up, unsheltered, before the hiddenBoer, and taking the results: Jameson's men would follow the custom.Jameson would not have listened to me--he would have been intent uponrepeating history, according to precedent.  Americans are not acquaintedwith the British-Boer war of 1881; but its history is interesting, andcould have been instructive to Jameson if he had been receptive.  I willcull some details of it from trustworthy sources mainly from "Russell'sNatal."  Mr. Russell is not a Boer, but a Briton.  He is inspector ofschools, and his history is a text-book whose purpose is the instructionof the Natal English youth.
After the seizure of the Transvaal and the suppression of the Boergovernment by England in 1877, the Boers fretted for three years, andmade several appeals to England for a restoration of their liberties,but without result.  Then they gathered themselves together in a greatmass-meeting at Krugersdorp, talked their troubles over, and resolved tofight for their deliverance from the British yoke.  (Krugersdorp--theplace where the Boers interrupted the Jameson raid.)  The little handfulof farmers rose against the strongest empire in the world.  Theyproclaimed martial law and the re-establishment of their Republic.  Theyorganized their forces and sent them forward to intercept the Britishbattalions. This, although Sir Garnet Wolseley had but lately madeproclamation that "so long as the sun shone in the heavens," theTransvaal would be and remain English territory.  And also in spite ofthe fact that the commander of the 94th regiment--already on the march tosuppress this rebellion--had been heard to say that "the Boers would turntail at the first beat of the big drum."--["South Africa As It Is,"by F. Reginald Statham, page 82.  London: T.  Fisher Unwin, 1897.]
Four days after the flag-raising, the Boer force which had been sentforward to forbid the invasion of the English troops met them atBronkhorst Spruit--246 men of the 94th regiment, in command of a colonel,the big drum beating, the band playing--and the first battle was fought.It lasted ten minutes.  Result:
     British loss, more than 150 officers and men, out of the 246.     Surrender of the remnant.
     Boer loss--if any--not stated.
They are fine marksmen, the Boers.  From the cradle up, they live onhorseback and hunt wild animals with the rifle.  They have a passion forliberty and the Bible, and care for nothing else.
"General Sir George Colley, Lieutenant-Governor and Commander-in-Chief inNatal, felt it his duty to proceed at once to the relief of the loyalistsand soldiers beleaguered in the different towns of the Transvaal."  Hemoved out with 1,000 men and some artillery.  He found the Boers encampedin a strong and sheltered position on high ground at Laing's Nek--everyBoer behind a rock.  Early in the morning of the 28th January, 1881, hemoved to the attack "with the 58th regiment, commanded by Colonel Deane,a mounted squadron of 70 men, the 60th Rifles, the Naval Brigade withthree rocket tubes, and the Artillery with six guns."  He shelled theBoers for twenty minutes, then the assault was delivered, the 58thmarching up the slope in solid column.  The battle was soon finished,with this result, according to Russell--
     British loss in killed and wounded, 174.
     Boer loss, "trifling."
Colonel Deane was killed, and apparently every officer above the grade oflieutenant was killed or wounded, for the 58th retreated to its camp incommand of a lieutenant.  ("Africa as It Is.")
That ended the second battle.
On the 7th of February General Colley discovered that the Boers wereflanking his position.  The next morning he left his camp at MountPleasant and marched out and crossed the Ingogo river with 270 men,started up the Ingogo heights, and there fought a battle which lastedfrom noon till nightfall.  He then retreated, leaving his wounded withhis military chaplain, and in recrossing the now swollen river lost someof his men by drowning.  That was the third Boer victory.  Result,according to Mr. Russell--
     British loss 150 out of 270 engaged.
     Boer loss, 8 killed, 9 wounded--17.
There was a season of quiet, now, but at the end of about three weeks SirGeorge Colley conceived the idea of climbing, with an infantry andartillery force, the steep and rugged mountain of Amajuba in the night--abitter hard task, but he accomplished it.  On the way he left about 200men to guard a strategic point, and took about 400 up the mountain withhim.  When the sun rose in the morning, there was an unpleasant surprisefor the Boers; yonder were the English troops visible on top of themountain two or three miles away, and now their own position was at themercy of the English artillery.  The Boer chief resolved to retreat--upthat mountain.  He asked for volunteers, and got them.
The storming party crossed the swale and began to creep up the steeps,"and from behind rocks and bushes they shot at the soldiers on theskyline as if they were stalking deer," says Mr. Russell.  There was"continuous musketry fire, steady and fatal on the one side, wild andineffectual on the other." The Boers reached the top, and began to put intheir ruinous work.  Presently the British "broke and fled for theirlives down the rugged steep." The Boers had won the battle.  Result inkilled and wounded, including among the killed the British General:
     British loss, 226, out of 400 engaged.
     Boer loss, 1 killed, 5 wounded.
That ended the war.  England listened to reason, and recognized the BoerRepublic--a government which has never been in any really awful dangersince, until Jameson started after it with his 500 "raw young fellows."To recapitulate:
The Boer farmers and British soldiers fought 4 battles, and the Boers wonthem all.  Result of the 4, in killed and wounded:
     British loss, 700 men.
     Boer loss, so far as known, 23 men.
It is interesting, now, to note how loyally Jameson and his severaltrained British military officers tried to make their battles conform toprecedent.  Mr. Garrett's account of the Raid is much the best one I havemet with, and my impressions of the Raid are drawn from that.
When Jameson learned that near Krugersdorp he would find 800 Boerswaiting to dispute his passage, he was not in the least disturbed.  Hewas feeling as he had felt two or three days before, when he had openedhis campaign with a historic remark to the same purport as the one withwhich the commander of the 94th had opened the Boer-British war offourteen years before.  That Commander's remark was, that the Boers"would turn tail at the first beat of the big drum."  Jameson's was, thatwith his "raw young fellows" he could kick the (persons) of the Boers"all round the Transvaal."  He was keeping close to historic precedent.
Jameson arrived in the presence of the Boers.  They--according toprecedent--were not visible.  It was a country of ridges, depressions,rocks, ditches, moraines of mining-tailings--not even as favorable forcavalry work as Laing's Nek had been in the former disastrous days.Jameson shot at the ridges and rocks with his artillery, just as GeneralColley had done at the Nek; and did them no damage and persuaded no Boerto show himself.  Then about a hundred of his men formed up to charge theridge-according to the 58th's precedent at the Nek; but as they dashedforward they opened out in a long line, which was a considerableimprovement on the 58th's tactics; when they had gotten to within 200yards of the ridge the concealed Boers opened out on them and emptied 20saddles.  The unwounded dismounted and fired at the rocks over the backsof their horses; but the return-fire was too hot, and they mounted again,"and galloped back or crawled away into a clump of reeds for cover, wherethey were shortly afterward taken prisoners as they lay among the reeds.Some thirty prisoners were so taken, and during the night which followedthe Boers carried away another thirty killed and wounded--the wounded toKrugersdorp hospital."  Sixty per cent. of the assaulted force disposedof--according to Mr. Garrett's estimate.
It was according to Amajuba precedent, where the British loss was 226 outof about 400 engaged.
Also, in Jameson's camp, that night, "there lay about 30 wounded orotherwise disabled" men.  Also during the night "some 30 or 40 youngfellows got separated from the command and straggled through intoJohannesburg."  Altogether a possible 150 men gone, out of his 530.  Hislads had fought valorously, but had not been able to get near enough to aBoer to kick him around the Transvaal.
At dawn the next morning the column of something short of 400 whitesresumed its march.  Jameson's grit was stubbornly good; indeed, it wasalways that.  He still had hopes.  There was a long and tediouszigzagging march through broken ground, with constant harassment from theBoers; and at last the column "walked into a sort of trap," and the Boers"closed in upon it."  "Men and horses dropped on all sides.  In thecolumn the feeling grew that unless it could burst through the Boer linesat this point it was done for.  The Maxims were fired until they grew toohot, and, water failing for the cool jacket, five of them jammed and wentout of action.  The 7-pounder was fired until only half an hour'sammunition was left to fire with.  One last rush was made, and failed,and then the Staats Artillery came up on the left flank, and the game wasup."
Jameson hoisted a white flag and surrendered.
There is a story, which may not be true, about an ignorant Boer farmerthere who thought that this white flag was the national flag of England.He had been at Bronkhorst, and Laing's Nek, and Ingogo and Amajuba, andsupposed that the English did not run up their flag excepting at the endof a fight.
The following is (as I understand it) Mr. Garrett's estimate of Jameson'stotal loss in killed and wounded for the two days:
"When they gave in they were minus some 20 per cent. of combatants.There were 76 casualties.  There were 30 men hurt or sick in the wagons.There were 27 killed on the spot or mortally wounded."
Total, 133, out of the original 530.  It is just 25 per cent.--[However,I judge that the total was really 150; for the number of wounded carriedto Krugersdorp hospital was 53; not 30, as Mr. Garrett reports it.  Thelady whose guest I was in Krugerdorp gave me the figures.  She was headnurse from the beginning of hostilities (Jan. 1) until the professionalnurses arrived, Jan. 8th.  Of the 53, "Three or four were Boers"; I quoteher words.]--This is a large improvement upon the precedents establishedat Bronkhorst, Laing's Nek, Ingogo, and Amajuba, and seems to indicatethat Boer marksmanship is not so good now as it was in those days.  Butthere is one detail in which the Raid-episode exactly repeats history.By surrender at Bronkhorst, the whole British force disappeared from thetheater of war; this was the case with Jameson's force.
In the Boer loss, also, historical precedent is followed with sufficientfidelity.  In the 4 battles named above, the Boer loss, so far as known,was an average of 6 men per battle, to the British average loss of 175.In Jameson's battles, as per Boer official report, the Boer loss inkilled was 4.  Two of these were killed by the Boers themselves, byaccident, the other by Jameson's army--one of them intentionally, theother by a pathetic mischance.  "A young Boer named Jacobz was movingforward to give a drink to one of the wounded troopers (Jameson's) afterthe first charge, when another wounded man, mistaking his intention; shothim."  There were three or four wounded Boers in the Krugersdorphospital, and apparently no others have been reported.  Mr. Garrett, "ona balance of probabilities, fully accepts the official version, andthanks Heaven the killed was not larger."
As a military man, I wish to point out what seems to me to be militaryerrors in the conduct of the campaign which we have just beenconsidering.  I have seen active service in the field, and it was in theactualities of war that I acquired my training and my right to speak.I served two weeks in the beginning of our Civil War, and during all thattime commanded a battery of infantry composed of twelve men.  GeneralGrant knew the history of my campaign, for I told it him.  I also toldhim the principle upon which I had conducted it; which was, to tire theenemy.  I tired out and disqualified many battalions, yet never had acasualty myself nor lost a man.  General Grant was not given to payingcompliments, yet he said frankly that if I had conducted the whole warmuch bloodshed would have been spared, and that what the army might havelost through the inspiriting results of collision in the field would havebeen amply made up by the liberalizing influences of travel.  Furtherendorsement does not seem to me to be necessary.
Let us now examine history, and see what it teaches.  In the 4 battlesfought in 1881 and the two fought by Jameson, the British loss in killed,wounded, and prisoners, was substantially 1,300 men; the Boer loss, asfar as is ascertainable, eras about 30 men.  These figures show thatthere was a defect somewhere.  It was not in the absence of courage.  Ithink it lay in the absence of discretion.  The Briton should have doneone thing or the other: discarded British methods and fought the Boerwith Boer methods, or augmented his own force until--using Britishmethods--it should be large enough to equalize results with the Boer.
To retain the British method requires certain things, determinable byarithmetic.  If, for argument's sake, we allow that the aggregate of1,716 British soldiers engaged in the 4 early battles was opposed by thesame aggregate of Boers, we have this result: the British loss of 700 andthe Boer loss of 23 argues that in order to equalize results in futurebattles you must make the British force thirty times as strong as theBoer force.  Mr. Garrett shows that the Boer force immediately opposed toJameson was 2,000, and that there were 6,000 more on hand by the eveningof the second day.  Arithmetic shows that in order to make himself theequal of the 8,000 Boers, Jameson should have had 240,000 men, whereas hemerely had 530 boys.  From a military point of view, backed by the factsof history, I conceive that Jameson's military judgment was at fault.
Another thing.--Jameson was encumbered by artillery, ammunition, andrifles.  The facts of the battle show that he should have had none ofthose things along.  They were heavy, they were in his way, they impededhis march.  There was nothing to shoot at but rocks--he knew quite wellthat there would be nothing to shoot at but rocks--and he knew thatartillery and rifles have no effect upon rocks.  He was badly overloadedwith unessentials.  He had 8 Maxims--a Maxim is a kind of Gatling, Ibelieve, and shoots about 500 bullets per minute; he had one12 1/2-pounder cannon and two 7-pounders; also, 145,000 rounds ofammunition. He worked the Maxims so hard upon the rocks that five of thembecame disabled--five of the Maxims, not the rocks.  It is believed thatupwards of 100,000 rounds of ammunition of the various kinds were firedduring the 21 hours that the battles lasted.  One man killed.  He musthave been much mutilated.  It was a pity to bring those futile Maximsalong. Jameson should have furnished himself with a battery of Pudd'nheadWilson maxims instead, They are much more deadly than those others, andthey are easily carried, because they have no weight.
Mr. Garrett--not very carefully concealing a smile--excuses the presenceof the Maxims by saying that they were of very substantial use becausetheir sputtering disordered the aim of the Boers, and in that way savedlives.
Three cannon, eight Maxims, and five hundred rifles yielded a resultwhich emphasized a fact which had already been established--that theBritish system of standing out in the open to fight Boers who are behindrocks is not wise, not excusable, and ought to be abandoned for somethingmore efficacious.  For the purpose of war is to kill, not merely to wasteammunition.
If I could get the management of one of those campaigns, I would knowwhat to do, for I have studied the Boer.  He values the Bible above everyother thing.  The most delicious edible in South Africa is "biltong."You will have seen it mentioned in Olive Schreiner's books.  It is whatour plainsmen call "jerked beef."  It is the Boer's main standby.  He hasa passion for it, and he is right.
If I had the command of the campaign I would go with rifles only, nocumbersome Maxims and cannon to spoil good rocks with.  I would movesurreptitiously by night to a point about a quarter of a mile from theBoer camp, and there I would build up a pyramid of biltong and Biblesfifty feet high, and then conceal my men all about.  In the morning theBoers would send out spies, and then the rest would come with a rush.I would surround them, and they would have to fight my men on equalterms, in the open.  There wouldn't be any Amajuba results.
--[Just as I am finishing this book an unfortunate dispute has sprung upbetween Dr. Jameson and his officers, on the one hand, and Colonel Rhodeson the other, concerning the wording of a note which Colonel Rhodes sentfrom Johannesburg by a cyclist to Jameson just before hostilities beganon the memorable New Year's Day.  Some of the fragments of this note werefound on the battlefield after the fight, and these have been piecedtogether; the dispute is as to what words the lacking fragmentscontained.  Jameson says the note promised him a reinforcement of 300 menfrom Johannesburg.  Colonel Rhodes denies this, and says he merelypromised to send out "some" men "to meet you."]
[It seems a pity that these friends should fall out over so little athing.  If the 300 had been sent, what good would it have done?  In 21hours of industrious fighting, Jameson's 530 men, with 8 Maxims, 3cannon, and 145,000 rounds of ammunition, killed an aggregate of 1.Boer.  These statistics show that a reinforcement of 300 Johannesburgers,armed merely with muskets, would have killed, at the outside, only alittle over a half of another Boer.  This would not have saved the day.It would not even have seriously affected the general result.  Thefigures show clearly, and with mathematical violence, that the only wayto save Jameson, or even give him a fair and equal chance with the enemy,was for Johannesburg to send him 240 Maxims, 90 cannon, 600 carloads ofammunition, and 240,000 men.  Johannesburg was not in a position to dothis.  Johannesburg has been called very hard names for not reinforcingJameson.  But in every instance this has been done by two classes ofpersons--people who do not read history, and people, like Jameson, who donot understand what it means, after they have read it.]
