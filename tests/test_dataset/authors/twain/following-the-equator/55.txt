FROM DIARY:
February 14.  We left at 4:30 P.M.  Until dark we moved through richvegetation, then changed to a boat and crossed the Ganges.
February 15.  Up with the sun.  A brilliant morning, and frosty.  Adouble suit of flannels is found necessary.  The plain is perfectlylevel, and seems to stretch away and away and away, dimming andsoftening, to the uttermost bounds of nowhere.  What a soaring,strenuous, gushing fountain spray of delicate greenery a bunch of bamboois!  As far as the eye can reach, these grand vegetable geysers grace theview, their spoutings refined to steam by distance.  And there are fieldsof bananas, with the sunshine glancing from the varnished surface oftheir drooping vast leaves.  And there are frequent groves of palm; andan effective accent is given to the landscape by isolated individuals ofthis picturesque family, towering, clean-stemmed, their plumes broken andhanging ragged, Nature's imitation of an umbrella that has been out tosee what a cyclone is like and is trying not to look disappointed.  Andeverywhere through the soft morning vistas we glimpse the villages, thecountless villages, the myriad villages, thatched, built of clean newmatting, snuggling among grouped palms and sheaves of bamboo; villages,villages, no end of villages, not three hundred yards apart, and dozensand dozens of them in sight all the time; a mighty City, hundreds ofmiles long, hundreds of miles broad, made all of villages, the biggestcity in the earth, and as populous as a European kingdom.  I have seen nosuch city as this before.  And there is a continuously repeated andreplenished multitude of naked men in view on both sides and ahead.  Wefly through it mile after mile, but still it is always there, on bothsides and ahead--brown-bodied, naked men and boys, plowing in the fields.But not woman.  In these two hours I have not seen a woman or a girlworking in the fields.
              "From Greenland's icy mountains,               From India's coral strand,               Where Afric's sunny fountains               Roll down their golden sand.               From many an ancient river,               From many a palmy plain,               They call us to deliver               Their land from error's chain."
Those are beautiful verses, and they have remained in my memory all mylife.  But if the closing lines are true, let us hope that when we cometo answer the call and deliver the land from its errors, we shall secretefrom it some of our high-civilization ways, and at the same time borrowsome of its pagan ways to enrich our high system with.  We have a rightto do this.  If we lift those people up, we have a right to liftourselves up nine or ten grades or so, at their expense.  A few years agoI spent several weeks at Tolz, in Bavaria.  It is a Roman Catholicregion, and not even Benares is more deeply or pervasively orintelligently devout.  In my diary of those days I find this:
     "We took a long drive yesterday around about the lovely country     roads.  But it was a drive whose pleasure was damaged in a couple of     ways: by the dreadful shrines and by the shameful spectacle of gray     and venerable old grandmothers toiling in the fields.  The shrines     were frequent along the roads--figures of the Saviour nailed to the     cross and streaming with blood from the wounds of the nails and the     thorns.
     "When missionaries go from here do they find fault with the pagan     idols?  I saw many women seventy and even eighty years old mowing     and binding in the fields, and pitchforking the loads into the     wagons."
I was in Austria later, and in Munich.  In Munich I saw gray old womenpushing trucks up hill and down, long distances, trucks laden withbarrels of beer, incredible loads.  In my Austrian diary I find this:
     "In the fields I often see a woman and a cow harnessed to the plow,     and a man driving.
     "In the public street of Marienbad to-day, I saw an old, bent,     gray-headed woman, in harness with a dog, drawing a laden sled over     bare dirt roads and bare pavements; and at his ease walked the     driver, smoking his pipe, a hale fellow not thirty years old."
Five or six years ago I bought an open boat, made a kind of a canvaswagon-roof over the stern of it to shelter me from sun and rain; hired acourier and a boatman, and made a twelve-day floating voyage down theRhone from Lake Bourget to Marseilles.  In my diary of that trip I findthis entry.  I was far down the Rhone then:
     "Passing St. Etienne, 2:15 P.M.  On a distant ridge inland, a tall     openwork structure commandingly situated, with a statue of the     Virgin standing on it.  A devout country.  All down this river,     wherever there is a crag there is a statue of the Virgin on it.  I     believe I have seen a hundred of them.  And yet, in many respects,     the peasantry seem to be mere pagans, and destitute of any     considerable degree of civilization.
     " .  .  .  .  We reached a not very promising looking village about     4 o'clock, and I concluded to tie up for the day; munching fruit and     fogging the hood with pipe-smoke had grown monotonous; I could not     have the hood furled, because the floods of rain fell unceasingly.     The tavern was on the river bank, as is the custom.  It was dull     there, and melancholy--nothing to do but look out of the window into     the drenching rain, and shiver; one could do that, for it was bleak     and cold and windy, and country France furnishes no fire.  Winter     overcoats did not help me much; they had to be supplemented with     rugs.  The raindrops were so large and struck the river with such     force that they knocked up the water like pebble-splashes.
     "With the exception of a very occasional woodenshod peasant, nobody     was abroad in this bitter weather--I mean nobody of our sex.  But     all weathers are alike to the women in these continental countries.     To them and the other animals, life is serious; nothing interrupts     their slavery.  Three of them were washing clothes in the river     under the window when I arrived, and they continued at it as long as     there was light to work by.  One was apparently thirty; another--the     mother!--above fifty; the third--grandmother!--so old and worn and     gray she could have passed for eighty; I took her to be that old.     They had no waterproofs nor rubbers, of course; over their shoulders     they wore gunnysacks--simply conductors for rivers of water; some of     the volume reached the ground; the rest soaked in on the way.
     "At last a vigorous fellow of thirty-five arrived, dry and     comfortable, smoking his pipe under his big umbrella in an open     donkey-cart-husband, son, and grandson of those women!  He stood up     in the cart, sheltering himself, and began to superintend, issuing     his orders in a masterly tone of command, and showing temper when     they were not obeyed swiftly enough.
     "Without complaint or murmur the drowned women patiently carried out     the orders, lifting the immense baskets of soggy, wrung-out clothing     into the cart and stowing them to the man's satisfaction.  There     were six of the great baskets, and a man of mere ordinary strength     could not have lifted any one of them.  The cart being full now, the     Frenchman descended, still sheltered by his umbrella, entered the     tavern, and the women went drooping homeward, trudging in the wake     of the cart, and soon were blended with the deluge and lost to     sight.
     "When I went down into the public room, the Frenchman had his bottle     of wine and plate of food on a bare table black with grease, and was     'chomping' like a horse.  He had the little religious paper which is     in everybody's hands on the Rhone borders, and was enlightening     himself with the histories of French saints who used to flee to the     desert in the Middle Ages to escape the contamination of woman.  For     two hundred years France has been sending missionaries to other     savage lands.  To spare to the needy from poverty like hers is fine     and true generosity."
But to get back to India--where, as my favorite poem says--
              "Every prospect pleases,               And only man is vile."
It is because Bavaria and Austria and France have not introduced theircivilization to him yet.  But Bavaria and Austria and France are on theirway.  They are coming.  They will rescue him; they will refine thevileness out of him.
Some time during the forenoon, approaching the mountains, we changed fromthe regular train to one composed of little canvas-sheltered cars thatskimmed along within a foot of the ground and seemed to be going fiftymiles an hour when they were really making about twenty.  Each car hadseating capacity for half-a-dozen persons; and when the curtains were upone was substantially out of doors, and could see everywhere, and get allthe breeze, and be luxuriously comfortable.  It was not a pleasureexcursion in name only, but in fact.
After a while the stopped at a little wooden coop of a station justwithin the curtain of the sombre jungle, a place with a deep and denseforest of great trees and scrub and vines all about it.  The royal Bengaltiger is in great force there, and is very bold and unconventional.  Fromthis lonely little station a message once went to the railway manager inCalcutta: "Tiger eating station-master on front porch; telegraphinstructions."
It was there that I had my first tiger hunt.  I killed thirteen.  We werepresently away again, and the train began to climb the mountains.  In oneplace seven wild elephants crossed the track, but two of them got awaybefore I could overtake them.  The railway journey up the mountain isforty miles, and it takes eight hours to make it.  It is so wild andinteresting and exciting and enchanting that it ought to take a week.  Asfor the vegetation, it is a museum.  The jungle seemed to contain samplesof every rare and curious tree and bush that we had ever seen or heardof.  It is from that museum, I think, that the globe must have beensupplied with the trees and vines and shrubs that it holds precious.
The road is infinitely and charmingly crooked.  It goes winding in andout under lofty cliffs that are smothered in vines and foliage, andaround the edges of bottomless chasms; and all the way one glides byfiles of picturesque natives, some carrying burdens up, others going downfrom their work in the tea-gardens; and once there was a gaudy weddingprocession, all bright tinsel and color, and a bride, comely and girlish,who peeped out from the curtains of her palanquin, exposing her face withthat pure delight which the young and happy take in sin for sin's ownsake.
By and by we were well up in the region of the clouds, and from thatbreezy height we looked down and afar over a wonderful picture--thePlains of India, stretching to the horizon, soft and fair, level as afloor, shimmering with heat, mottled with cloud-shadows, and cloven withshining rivers.  Immediately below us, and receding down, down, down,toward the valley, was a shaven confusion of hilltops, with ribbony roadsand paths squirming and snaking cream-yellow all over them and aboutthem, every curve and twist sharply distinct.
At an elevation of 6,000 feet we entered a thick cloud, and it shut outthe world and kept it shut out.  We climbed 1,000 feet higher, then beganto descend, and presently got down to Darjeeling, which is 6,000 feetabove the level of the Plains.
We had passed many a mountain village on the way up, and seen some newkinds of natives, among them many samples of the fighting Ghurkas.  Theyare not large men, but they are strong and resolute.  There are no bettersoldiers among Britain's native troops.  And we had passed shoals oftheir women climbing the forty miles of steep road from the valley totheir mountain homes, with tall baskets on their backs hitched to theirforeheads by a band, and containing a freightage weighing--I will not sayhow many hundreds of pounds, for the sum is unbelievable.  These wereyoung women, and they strode smartly along under these astonishingburdens with the air of people out for a holiday.  I was told that awoman will carry a piano on her back all the way up the mountain; andthat more than once a woman had done it.  If these were old women Ishould regard the Ghurkas as no more civilized than the Europeans.At the railway station at Darjeeling you find plenty of cab-substitutes--open coffins, in which you sit, and are then borne on men's shoulders upthe steep roads into the town.
Up there we found a fairly comfortable hotel, the property of anindiscriminate and incoherent landlord, who looks after nothing, butleaves everything to his army of Indian servants.  No, he does look afterthe bill--to be just to him--and the tourist cannot do better than followhis example.  I was told by a resident that the summit of Kinchinjunga isoften hidden in the clouds, and that sometimes a tourist has waitedtwenty-two days and then been obliged to go away without a sight of it.And yet went not disappointed; for when he got his hotel bill herecognized that he was now seeing the highest thing in the Himalayas.But this is probably a lie.
After lecturing I went to the Club that night, and that was a comfortableplace.  It is loftily situated, and looks out over a vast spread ofscenery; from it you can see where the boundaries of three countries cometogether, some thirty miles away; Thibet is one of them, Nepaul another,and I think Herzegovina was the other.  Apparently, in every town andcity in India the gentlemen of the British civil and military servicehave a club; sometimes it is a palatial one, always it is pleasant andhomelike.  The hotels are not always as good as they might be, and thestranger who has access to the Club is grateful for his privilege andknows how to value it.
Next day was Sunday.  Friends came in the gray dawn with horses, and myparty rode away to a distant point where Kinchinjunga and Mount Everestshow up best, but I stayed at home for a private view; for it was veryold, and I was not acquainted with the horses, any way.  I got a pipe anda few blankets and sat for two hours at the window, and saw the sun driveaway the veiling gray and touch up the snow-peaks one after another withpale pink splashes and delicate washes of gold, and finally flood thewhole mighty convulsion of snow-mountains with a deluge of richsplendors.
Kinchinjunga's peak was but fitfully visible, but in the between times itwas vividly clear against the sky--away up there in the blue dome morethan 28,000 feet above sea level--the loftiest land I had ever seen, by12,000 feet or more.  It was 45 miles away.  Mount Everest is a thousandfeet higher, but it was not a part of that sea of mountains piled upthere before me, so I did not see it; but I did not care, because I thinkthat mountains that are as high as that are disagreeable.
I changed from the back to the front of the house and spent the rest ofthe morning there, watching the swarthy strange tribes flock by fromtheir far homes in the Himalayas.  All ages and both sexes wererepresented, and the breeds were quite new to me, though the costumes ofthe Thibetans made them look a good deal like Chinamen.  The prayer-wheelwas a frequent feature.  It brought me near to these people, and madethem seem kinfolk of mine.  Through our preacher we do much of ourpraying by proxy.  We do not whirl him around a stick, as they do, butthat is merely a detail.  The swarm swung briskly by, hour after hour, astrange and striking pageant.  It was wasted there, and it seemed a pity.It should have been sent streaming through the cities of Europe orAmerica, to refresh eyes weary of the pale monotonies of thecircus-pageant.  These people were bound for the bazar, with things tosell.  We went down there, later, and saw that novel congress of the wildpeoples, and plowed here and there through it, and concluded that itwould be worth coming from Calcutta to see, even if there were noKinchinjunga and Everest.
