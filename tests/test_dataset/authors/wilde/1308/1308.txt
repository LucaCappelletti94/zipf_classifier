It has constantly been made a subject of reproach against artistsand men of letters that they are lacking in wholeness andcompleteness of nature. As a rule this must necessarily be so.That very concentration of vision and intensity of purpose which isthe characteristic of the artistic temperament is in itself a modeof limitation. To those who are preoccupied with the beauty ofform nothing else seems of much importance. Yet there are manyexceptions to this rule. Rubens served as ambassador, and Goetheas state councillor, and Milton as Latin secretary to Cromwell.Sophocles held civic office in his own city; the humourists,essayists, and novelists of modern America seem to desire nothingbetter than to become the diplomatic representatives of theircountry; and Charles Lamb's friend, Thomas Griffiths Wainewright,the subject of this brief memoir, though of an extremely artistictemperament, followed many masters other than art, being not merelya poet and a painter, an art-critic, an antiquarian, and a writerof prose, an amateur of beautiful things, and a dilettante ofthings delightful, but also a forger of no mean or ordinarycapabilities, and as a subtle and secret poisoner almost withoutrival in this or any age.This remarkable man, so powerful with 'pen, pencil and poison,' asa great poet of our own day has finely said of him, was born atChiswick, in 1794. His father was the son of a distinguishedsolicitor of Gray's Inn and Hatton Garden. His mother was thedaughter of the celebrated Dr. Griffiths, the editor and founder ofthe Monthly Review, the partner in another literary speculation ofThomas Davis, that famous bookseller of whom Johnson said that hewas not a bookseller, but 'a gentleman who dealt in books,' thefriend of Goldsmith and Wedgwood, and one of the most well-knownmen of his day. Mrs. Wainewright died, in giving him birth, at theearly age of twenty-one, and an obituary notice in the Gentleman'sMagazine tells us of her 'amiable disposition and numerousaccomplishments,' and adds somewhat quaintly that 'she is supposedto have understood the writings of Mr. Locke as well as perhaps anyperson of either sex now living.' His father did not long survivehis young wife, and the little child seems to have been brought upby his grandfather, and, on the death of the latter in 1803, by hisuncle George Edward Griffiths, whom he subsequently poisoned. Hisboyhood was passed at Linden House, Turnham Green, one of thosemany fine Georgian mansions that have unfortunately disappearedbefore the inroads of the suburban builder, and to its lovelygardens and well-timbered park he owed that simple and impassionedlove of nature which never left him all through his life, and whichmade him so peculiarly susceptible to the spiritual influences ofWordsworth's poetry. He went to school at Charles Burney's academyat Hammersmith. Mr. Burney was the son of the historian of music,and the near kinsman of the artistic lad who was destined to turnout his most remarkable pupil. He seems to have been a man of agood deal of culture, and in after years Mr. Wainewright oftenspoke of him with much affection as a philosopher, anarchaeologist, and an admirable teacher who, while he valued theintellectual side of education, did not forget the importance ofearly moral training. It was under Mr. Burney that he firstdeveloped his talent as an artist, and Mr. Hazlitt tells us that adrawing-book which he used at school is still extant, and displaysgreat talent and natural feeling. Indeed, painting was the firstart that fascinated him. It was not till much later that he soughtto find expression by pen or poison.Before this, however, he seems to have been carried away by boyishdreams of the romance and chivalry of a soldier's life, and to havebecome a young guardsman. But the reckless dissipated life of hiscompanions failed to satisfy the refined artistic temperament ofone who was made for other things. In a short time he wearied ofthe service. 'Art,' he tells us, in words that still move many bytheir ardent sincerity and strange fervour, 'Art touched herrenegade; by her pure and high influence the noisome mists werepurged; my feelings, parched, hot, and tarnished, were renovatedwith cool, fresh bloom, simple, beautiful to the simple-hearted.'But Art was not the only cause of the change. 'The writings ofWordsworth,' he goes on to say, 'did much towards calming theconfusing whirl necessarily incident to sudden mutations. I weptover them tears of happiness and gratitude.' He accordingly leftthe army, with its rough barrack-life and coarse mess-room tittle-tattle, and returned to Linden House, full of this new-bornenthusiasm for culture. A severe illness, in which, to use his ownwords, he was 'broken like a vessel of clay,' prostrated him for atime. His delicately strung organisation, however indifferent itmight have been to inflicting pain on others, was itself mostkeenly sensitive to pain. He shrank from suffering as a thing thatmars and maims human life, and seems to have wandered through thatterrible valley of melancholia from which so many great, perhapsgreater, spirits have never emerged. But he was young--onlytwenty-five years of age--and he soon passed out of the 'dead blackwaters,' as he called them, into the larger air of humanisticculture. As he was recovering from the illness that had led himalmost to the gates of death, he conceived the idea of taking upliterature as an art. 'I said with John Woodvil,' he cries, 'itwere a life of gods to dwell in such an element,' to see and hearand write brave things:-'These high and gusty relishes of lifeHave no allayings of mortality.'It is impossible not to feel that in this passage we have theutterance of a man who had a true passion for letters. 'To see andhear and write brave things,' this was his aim.Scott, the editor of the London Magazine, struck by the young man'sgenius, or under the influence of the strange fascination that heexercised on every one who knew him, invited him to write a seriesof articles on artistic subjects, and under a series of fancifulpseudonym he began to contribute to the literature of his day.Janus Weathercock, Egomet Bonmot, and Van Vinkvooms, were some ofthe grotesque masks under which he choose to hide his seriousnessor to reveal his levity. A mask tells us more than a face. Thesedisguises intensified his personality. In an incredibly short timehe seems to have made his mark. Charles Lamb speaks of 'kind,light-hearted Wainewright,' whose prose is 'capital.' We hear ofhim entertaining Macready, John Forster, Maginn, Talfourd, SirWentworth Dilke, the poet John Clare, and others, at a petit-diner.Like Disraeli, he determined to startle the town as a dandy, andhis beautiful rings, his antique cameo breast-pin, and his palelemon-coloured kid gloves, were well known, and indeed wereregarded by Hazlitt as being the signs of a new manner inliterature: while his rich curly hair, fine eyes, and exquisitewhite hands gave him the dangerous and delightful distinction ofbeing different from others. There was something in him ofBalzac's Lucien de Rubempre. At times he reminds us of JulienSorel. De Quincey saw him once. It was at a dinner at CharlesLamb's. 'Amongst the company, all literary men, sat a murderer,'he tells us, and he goes on to describe how on that day he had beenill, and had hated the face of man and woman, and yet found himselflooking with intellectual interest across the table at the youngwriter beneath whose affectations of manner there seemed to him tolie so much unaffected sensibility, and speculates on 'what suddengrowth of another interest' would have changed his mood, had heknown of what terrible sin the guest to whom Lamb paid so muchattention was even then guilty.His life-work falls naturally under the three heads suggested byMr. Swinburne, and it may be partly admitted that, if we set asidehis achievements in the sphere of poison, what he has actually leftto us hardly justifies his reputation.But then it is only the Philistine who seeks to estimate apersonality by the vulgar test of production. This young dandysought to be somebody, rather than to do something. He recognisedthat Life itself is in art, and has its modes of style no less thanthe arts that seek to express it. Nor is his work withoutinterest. We hear of William Blake stopping in the Royal Academybefore one of his pictures and pronouncing it to be 'very fine.'His essays are prefiguring of much that has since been realised.He seems to have anticipated some of those accidents of modernculture that are regarded by many as true essentials. He writesabout La Gioconda, and early French poets and the ItalianRenaissance. He loves Greek gems, and Persian carpets, andElizabethan translations of Cupid and Psyche, and theHypnerotomachia, and book-binding and early editions, and wide-margined proofs. He is keenly sensitive to the value of beautifulsurroundings, and never wearies of describing to us the rooms inwhich he lived, or would have liked to live. He had that curiouslove of green, which in individuals is always the sign of a subtleartistic temperament, and in nations is said to denote a laxity, ifnot a decadence of morals. Like Baudelaire he was extremely fondof cats, and with Gautier, he was fascinated by that 'sweet marblemonster' of both sexes that we can still see at Florence and in theLouvre.There is of course much in his descriptions, and his suggestionsfor decoration, that shows that he did not entirely free himselffrom the false taste of his time. But it is clear that he was oneof the first to recognise what is, indeed, the very keynote ofaesthetic eclecticism, I mean the true harmony of all reallybeautiful things irrespective of age or place, of school or manner.He saw that in decorating a room, which is to be, not a room forshow, but a room to live in, we should never aim at anyarchaeological reconstruction of the past, nor burden ourselveswith any fanciful necessity for historical accuracy. In thisartistic perception he was perfectly right. All beautiful thingsbelong to the same age.And so, in his own library, as he describes it, we find thedelicate fictile vase of the Greek, with its exquisitely paintedfigures and the faint [Greek text which cannot be reproduced]finely traced upon its side, and behind it hangs an engraving ofthe 'Delphic Sibyl' of Michael Angelo, or of the 'Pastoral' ofGiorgione. Here is a bit of Florentine majolica, and here a rudelamp from some old Roman tomb. On the table lies a book of Hours,'cased in a cover of solid silver gilt, wrought with quaint devicesand studded with small brilliants and rubies,' and close by it'squats a little ugly monster, a Lar, perhaps, dug up in the sunnyfields of corn-bearing Sicily.' Some dark antique bronzes contrastwith the pale gleam of two noble Christi Crucifixi, one carved inivory, the other moulded in wax.' He has his trays of Tassie'sgems, his tiny Louis-Quatorze bonbonniere with a miniature byPetitot, his highly prized 'brown-biscuit teapots, filagree-worked,' his citron morocco letter-case, and his 'pomona-green'chair.One can fancy him lying there in the midst of his books and castsand engravings, a true virtuoso, a subtle connoisseur, turning overhis fine collection of Mare Antonios, and his Turner's 'LiberStudiorum,' of which he was a warm admirer, or examining with amagnifier some of his antique gems and cameos, 'the head ofAlexander on an onyx of two strata,' or 'that superb altissimorelievo on cornelian, Jupiter AEgiochus.' He was always a greatamateur of engravings, and gives some very useful suggestions as tothe best means of forming a collection. Indeed, while fullyappreciating modern art, he never lost sight of the importance ofreproductions of the great masterpieces of the past, and all thathe says about the value of plaster casts is quite admirable.As an art-critic he concerned himself primarily with the compleximpressions produced by a work of art, and certainly the first stepin aesthetic criticism is to realise one's own impressions. Hecared nothing for abstract discussions on the nature of theBeautiful, and the historical method, which has since yielded suchrich fruit, did not belong to his day, but he never lost sight ofthe great truth that Art's first appeal is neither to the intellectnor to the emotions, but purely to the artistic temperament, and hemore than once points out that this temperament, this 'taste,' ashe calls it, being unconsciously guided and made perfect byfrequent contact with the best work, becomes in the end a form ofright judgment. Of course there are fashions in art just as thereare fashions in dress, and perhaps none of us can ever quite freeourselves from the influence of custom and the influence ofnovelty. He certainly could not, and he frankly acknowledges howdifficult it is to form any fair estimate of contemporary work.But, on the whole, his taste was good and sound. He admired Turnerand Constable at a time when they were not so much thought of asthey are now, and saw that for the highest landscape art we requiremore than 'mere industry and accurate transcription.' Of Crome's'Heath Scene near Norwich' he remarks that it shows 'how much asubtle observation of the elements, in their wild moods, does for amost uninteresting flat,' and of the popular type of landscape ofhis day he says that it is 'simply an enumeration of hill and dale,stumps of trees, shrubs, water, meadows, cottages and houses;little more than topography, a kind of pictorial map-work; in whichrainbows, showers, mists, haloes, large beams shooting throughrifted clouds, storms, starlight, all the most valued materials ofthe real painter, are not.' He had a thorough dislike of what isobvious or commonplace in art, and while he was charmed toentertain Wilkie at dinner, he cared as little for Sir David'spictures as he did for Mr. Crabbe's poems. With the imitative andrealistic tendencies of his day he had no sympathy and he tells usfrankly that his great admiration for Fuseli was largely due to thefact that the little Swiss did not consider it necessary that anartist should paint only what he sees. The qualities that hesought for in a picture were composition, beauty and dignity ofline, richness of colour, and imaginative power. Upon the otherhand, he was not a doctrinaire. 'I hold that no work of art can betried otherwise than by laws deduced from itself: whether or notit be consistent with itself is the question.' This is one of hisexcellent aphorisms. And in criticising painters so different asLandseer and Martin, Stothard and Etty, he shows that, to use aphrase now classical, he is trying 'to see the object as in itselfit really is.'However, as I pointed out before, he never feels quite at his easein his criticisms of contemporary work. 'The present,' he says,'is about as agreeable a confusion to me as Ariosto on the firstperusal. . . . Modern things dazzle me. I must look at themthrough Time's telescope. Elia complains that to him the merit ofa MS. poem is uncertain; "print," as he excellently says, "settlesit." Fifty years' toning does the same thing to a picture.' He ishappier when he is writing about Watteau and Lancret, about Rubensand Giorgione, about Rembrandt, Corregio, and Michael Angelo;happiest of all when he is writing about Greek things. What isGothic touched him very little, but classical art and the art ofthe Renaissance were always dear to him. He saw what our Englishschool could gain from a study of Greek models, and never weariesof pointing out to the young student the artistic possibilitiesthat lie dormant in Hellenic marbles and Hellenic methods of work.In his judgments on the great Italian Masters, says De Quincey,'there seemed a tone of sincerity and of native sensibility, as inone who spoke for himself, and was not merely a copier from books.'The highest praise that we can give to him is that he tried torevive style as a conscious tradition. But he saw that no amountof art lectures or art congresses, or 'plans for advancing the finearts,' will ever produce this result. The people, he says verywisely, and in the true spirit of Toynbee Hall, must always have'the best models constantly before their eyes.'As is to be expected from one who was a painter, he is oftenextremely technical in his art criticisms. Of Tintoret's 'St.George delivering the Egyptian Princess from the Dragon,' heremarks:-The robe of Sabra, warmly glazed with Prussian blue, is relievedfrom the pale greenish background by a vermilion scarf; and thefull hues of both are beautifully echoed, as it were, in a lowerkey by the purple-lake coloured stuffs and bluish iron armour ofthe saint, besides an ample balance to the vivid azure drapery onthe foreground in the indigo shades of the wild wood surroundingthe castle.And elsewhere he talks learnedly of 'a delicate Schiavone, variousas a tulip-bed, with rich broken tints,' of 'a glowing portrait,remarkable for morbidezza, by the scarce Moroni,' and of anotherpicture being 'pulpy in the carnations.'But, as a rule, he deals with his impressions of the work as anartistic whole, and tries to translate those impressions intowords, to give, as it were, the literary equivalent for theimaginative and mental effect. He was one of the first to developwhat has been called the art-literature of the nineteenth century,that form of literature which has found in Mr. Ruskin and Mr.Browning, its two most perfect exponents. His description ofLancret's Repas Italien, in which 'a dark-haired girl, "amorous ofmischief," lies on the daisy-powdered grass,' is in some respectsvery charming. Here is his account of 'The Crucifixion,' byRembrandt. It is extremely characteristic of his style:-Darkness--sooty, portentous darkness--shrouds the whole scene:only above the accursed wood, as if through a horrid rift in themurky ceiling, a rainy deluge--'sleety-flaw, discoloured water'--streams down amain, spreading a grisly spectral light, even morehorrible than that palpable night. Already the Earth pants thickand fast! the darkened Cross trembles! the winds are dropt--the airis stagnant--a muttering rumble growls underneath their feet, andsome of that miserable crowd begin to fly down the hill. Thehorses snuff the coming terror, and become unmanageable throughfear. The moment rapidly approaches when, nearly torn asunder byHis own weight, fainting with loss of blood, which now runs innarrower rivulets from His slit veins, His temples and breastdrowned in sweat, and His black tongue parched with the fierydeath-fever, Jesus cries, 'I thirst.' The deadly vinegar iselevated to Him.His head sinks, and the sacred corpse 'swings senseless of thecross.' A sheet of vermilion flame shoots sheer through the airand vanishes; the rocks of Carmel and Lebanon cleave asunder; thesea rolls on high from the sands its black weltering waves. Earthyawns, and the graves give up their dwellers. The dead and theliving are mingled together in unnatural conjunction and hurrythrough the holy city. New prodigies await them there. The veilof the temple--the unpierceable veil--is rent asunder from top tobottom, and that dreaded recess containing the Hebrew mysteries--the fatal ark with the tables and seven-branched candelabrum--isdisclosed by the light of unearthly flames to the God-desertedmultitude.Rembrandt never painted this sketch, and he was quite right. Itwould have lost nearly all its charms in losing that perplexingveil of indistinctness which affords such ample range wherein thedoubting imagination may speculate. At present it is like a thingin another world. A dark gulf is betwixt us. It is not tangibleby the body. We can only approach it in the spirit.In this passage, written, the author tells us, 'in awe andreverence,' there is much that is terrible, and very much that isquite horrible, but it is not without a certain crude form ofpower, or, at any rate, a certain crude violence of words, aquality which this age should highly appreciate, as it is its chiefdefect. It is pleasanter, however, to pass to this description ofGiulio Romano's 'Cephalus and Procris':-We should read Moschus's lament for Bion, the sweet shepherd,before looking at this picture, or study the picture as apreparation for the lament. We have nearly the same images inboth. For either victim the high groves and forest dells murmur;the flowers exhale sad perfume from their buds; the nightingalemourns on the craggy lands, and the swallow in the long-windingvales; 'the satyrs, too, and fauns dark-veiled groan,' and thefountain nymphs within the wood melt into tearful waters. Thesheep and goats leave their pasture; and oreads, 'who love to scalethe most inaccessible tops of all uprightest rocks,' hurry downfrom the song of their wind-courting pines; while the dryads bendfrom the branches of the meeting trees, and the rivers moan forwhite Procris, 'with many-sobbing streams,'Filling the far-seen ocean with a voice.The golden bees are silent on the thymy Hymettus; and the knellinghorn of Aurora's love no more shall scatter away the cold twilighton the top of Hymettus. The foreground of our subject is a grassysunburnt bank, broken into swells and hollows like waves (a sort ofland-breakers), rendered more uneven by many foot-tripping rootsand stumps of trees stocked untimely by the axe, which are againthrowing out light-green shoots. This bank rises rather suddenlyon the right to a clustering grove, penetrable to no star, at theentrance of which sits the stunned Thessalian king, holding betweenhis knees that ivory-bright body which was, but an instant agone,parting the rough boughs with her smooth forehead, and treadingalike on thorns and flowers with jealousy-stung foot--now helpless,heavy, void of all motion, save when the breeze lifts her thickhair in mockery.From between the closely-neighboured boles astonished nymphs pressforward with loud cries -And deerskin-vested satyrs, crowned with ivy twists, advance;And put strange pity in their horned countenance.Laelaps lies beneath, and shows by his panting the rapid pace ofdeath. On the other side of the group, Virtuous Love with 'vansdejected' holds forth the arrow to an approaching troop of sylvanpeople, fauns, rams, goats, satyrs, and satyr-mothers, pressingtheir children tighter with their fearful hands, who hurry alongfrom the left in a sunken path between the foreground and a rockywall, on whose lowest ridge a brook-guardian pours from her urn hergrief-telling waters. Above and more remote than the Ephidryad,another female, rending her locks, appears among the vine-festoonedpillars of an unshorn grove. The centre of the picture is filledby shady meadows, sinking down to a river-mouth; beyond is 'thevast strength of the ocean stream,' from whose floor theextinguisher of stars, rosy Aurora, drives furiously up her brine-washed steeds to behold the death-pangs of her rival.Were this description carefully re-written, it would be quiteadmirable. The conception of making a prose poem out of paint isexcellent. Much of the best modern literature springs from thesame aim. In a very ugly and sensible age, the arts borrow, notfrom life, but from each other.His sympathies, too, were wonderfully varied. In everythingconnected with the stage, for instance, he was always extremelyinterested, and strongly upheld the necessity for archaeologicalaccuracy in costume and scene-painting. 'In art,' he says in oneof his essays, 'whatever is worth doing at all is worth doingwell'; and he points out that once we allow the intrusion ofanachronisms, it becomes difficult to say where the line is to bedrawn. In literature, again, like Lord Beaconsfield on a famousoccasion, he was 'on the side of the angels.' He was one of thefirst to admire Keats and Shelley--'the tremulously-sensitive andpoetical Shelley,' as he calls him. His admiration for Wordsworthwas sincere and profound. He thoroughly appreciated William Blake.One of the best copies of the 'Songs of Innocence and Experience'that is now in existence was wrought specially for him. He lovedAlain Chartier, and Ronsard, and the Elizabethan dramatists, andChaucer and Chapman, and Petrarch. And to him all the arts wereone. 'Our critics,' he remarks with much wisdom, 'seem hardlyaware of the identity of the primal seeds of poetry and painting,nor that any true advancement in the serious study of one art co-generates a proportionate perfection in the other'; and he sayselsewhere that if a man who does not admire Michael Angelo talks ofhis love for Milton, he is deceiving either himself or hislisteners. To his fellow-contributors in the London Magazine hewas always most generous, and praises Barry Cornwall, AllanCunningham, Hazlitt, Elton, and Leigh Hunt without anything of themalice of a friend. Some of his sketches of Charles Lamb areadmirable in their way, and, with the art of the true comedian,borrow their style from their subject:-What can I say of thee more than all know? that thou hadst thegaiety of a boy with the knowledge of a man: as gentle a heart asever sent tears to the eyes.How wittily would he mistake your meaning, and put in a conceitmost seasonably out of season. His talk without affectation wascompressed, like his beloved Elizabethans, even unto obscurity.Like grains of fine gold, his sentences would beat out into wholesheets. He had small mercy on spurious fame, and a causticobservation on the FASHION FOR MEN OF GENIUS was a standing dish.Sir Thomas Browne was a 'bosom cronie' of his; so was Burton, andold Fuller. In his amorous vein he dallied with that peerlessDuchess of many-folio odour; and with the heyday comedies ofBeaumont and Fletcher he induced light dreams. He would delivercritical touches on these, like one inspired, but it was good tolet him choose his own game; if another began even on theacknowledged pets he was liable to interrupt, or rather append, ina mode difficult to define whether as misapprehensive ormischievous. One night at C-'s, the above dramatic partners werethe temporary subject of chat. Mr. X. commended the passion andhaughty style of a tragedy (I don't know which of them), but wasinstantly taken up by Elia, who told him 'THAT was nothing; thelyrics were the high things--the lyrics!'One side of his literary career deserves especial notice. Modernjournalism may be said to owe almost as much to him as to any manof the early part of this century. He was the pioneer of Asiaticprose, and delighted in pictorial epithets and pompousexaggerations. To have a style so gorgeous that it conceals thesubject is one of the highest achievements of an important and muchadmired school of Fleet Street leader-writers, and this schoolJanus Weathercock may be said to have invented. He also saw thatit was quite easy by continued reiteration to make the publicinterested in his own personality, and in his purely journalisticarticles this extraordinary young man tells the world what he hadfor dinner, where he gets his clothes, what wines he likes, and inwhat state of health he is, just as if he were writing weekly notesfor some popular newspaper of our own time. This being the leastvaluable side of his work, is the one that has had the most obviousinfluence. A publicist, nowadays, is a man who bores the communitywith the details of the illegalities of his private life.Like most artificial people, he had a great love of nature. 'Ihold three things in high estimation,' he says somewhere: 'to sitlazily on an eminence that commands a rich prospect; to be shadowedby thick trees while the sun shines around me; and to enjoysolitude with the consciousness of neighbourhood. The countrygives them all to me.' He writes about his wandering over fragrantfurze and heath repeating Collins's 'Ode to Evening,' just to catchthe fine quality of the moment; about smothering his face 'in awatery bed of cowslips, wet with May dews'; and about the pleasureof seeing the sweet-breathed kine 'pass slowly homeward through thetwilight,' and hearing 'the distant clank of the sheep-bell.' Onephrase of his, 'the polyanthus glowed in its cold bed of earth,like a solitary picture of Giorgione on a dark oaken panel,' iscuriously characteristic of his temperament, and this passage israther pretty in its way:-The short tender grass was covered with marguerites--'such that mencalled DAISIES in our town'--thick as stars on a summer's night.The harsh caw of the busy rooks came pleasantly mellowed from ahigh dusky grove of elms at some distance off, and at intervals washeard the voice of a boy scaring away the birds from the newly-sownseeds. The blue depths were the colour of the darkest ultramarine;not a cloud streaked the calm aether; only round the horizon's edgestreamed a light, warm film of misty vapour, against which the nearvillage with its ancient stone church showed sharply out withblinding whiteness. I thought of Wordsworth's 'Lines written inMarch.'However, we must not forget that the cultivated young man whopenned these lines, and who was so susceptible to Wordsworthianinfluences, was also, as I said at the beginning of this memoir,one of the most subtle and secret poisoners of this or any age.How he first became fascinated by this strange sin he does not tellus, and the diary in which he carefully noted the results of histerrible experiments and the methods that he adopted, hasunfortunately been lost to us. Even in later days, too, he wasalways reticent on the matter, and preferred to speak about 'TheExcursion,' and the 'Poems founded on the Affections.' There is nodoubt, however, that the poison that he used was strychnine. Inone of the beautiful rings of which he was so proud, and whichserved to show off the fine modelling of his delicate ivory hands,he used to carry crystals of the Indian nux vomica, a poison, oneof his biographers tells us, 'nearly tasteless, difficult ofdiscovery, and capable of almost infinite dilution.' His murders,says De Quincey, were more than were ever made known judicially.This is no doubt so, and some of them are worthy of mention. Hisfirst victim was his uncle, Mr. Thomas Griffiths. He poisoned himin 1829 to gain possession of Linden House, a place to which he hadalways been very much attached. In the August of the next year hepoisoned Mrs. Abercrombie, his wife's mother, and in the followingDecember he poisoned the lovely Helen Abercrombie, his sister-in-law. Why he murdered Mrs. Abercrombie is not ascertained. It mayhave been for a caprice, or to quicken some hideous sense of powerthat was in him, or because she suspected something, or for noreason. But the murder of Helen Abercrombie was carried out byhimself and his wife for the sake of a sum of about 18,000 pounds,for which they had insured her life in various offices. Thecircumstances were as follows. On the 12th of December, he and hiswife and child came up to London from Linden House, and tooklodgings at No. 12 Conduit Street, Regent Street. With them werethe two sisters, Helen and Madeleine Abercrombie. On the eveningof the 14th they all went to the play, and at supper that nightHelen sickened. The next day she was extremely ill, and Dr.Locock, of Hanover Square, was called in to attend her. She livedtill Monday, the 20th, when, after the doctor's morning visit, Mr.and Mrs. Wainewright brought her some poisoned jelly, and then wentout for a walk. When they returned Helen Abercrombie was dead.She was about twenty years of age, a tall graceful girl with fairhair. A very charming red-chalk drawing of her by her brother-in-law is still in existence, and shows how much his style as anartist was influenced by Sir Thomas Lawrence, a painter for whosework he had always entertained a great admiration. De Quincey saysthat Mrs. Wainewright was not really privy to the murder. Let ushope that she was not. Sin should be solitary, and have noaccomplices.The insurance companies, suspecting the real facts of the case,declined to pay the policy on the technical ground ofmisrepresentation and want of interest, and, with curious courage,the poisoner entered an action in the Court of Chancery against theImperial, it being agreed that one decision should govern all thecases. The trial, however, did not come on for five years, when,after one disagreement, a verdict was ultimately given in thecompanies' favour. The judge on the occasion was Lord Abinger.Egomet Bonmot was represented by Mr. Erle and Sir William Follet,and the Attorney-General and Sir Frederick Pollock appeared for theother side. The plaintiff, unfortunately, was unable to be presentat either of the trials. The refusal of the companies to give himthe 18,000 pounds had placed him in a position of most painfulpecuniary embarrassment. Indeed, a few months after the murder ofHelen Abercrombie, he had been actually arrested for debt in thestreets of London while he was serenading the pretty daughter ofone of his friends. This difficulty was got over at the time, butshortly afterwards he thought it better to go abroad till he couldcome to some practical arrangement with his creditors. Heaccordingly went to Boulogne on a visit to the father of the younglady in question, and while he was there induced him to insure hislife with the Pelican Company for 3000 pounds. As soon as thenecessary formalities had been gone through and the policyexecuted, he dropped some crystals of strychnine into his coffee asthey sat together one evening after dinner. He himself did notgain any monetary advantage by doing this. His aim was simply torevenge himself on the first office that had refused to pay him theprice of his sin. His friend died the next day in his presence,and he left Boulogne at once for a sketching tour through the mostpicturesque parts of Brittany, and was for some time the guest ofan old French gentleman, who had a beautiful country house at St.Omer. From this he moved to Paris, where he remained for severalyears, living in luxury, some say, while others talk of his'skulking with poison in his pocket, and being dreaded by all whoknew him.' In 1837 he returned to England privately. Some strangemad fascination brought him back. He followed a woman whom heloved.It was the month of June, and he was staying at one of the hotelsin Covent Garden. His sitting-room was on the ground floor, and heprudently kept the blinds down for fear of being seen. Thirteenyears before, when he was making his fine collection of majolicaand Marc Antonios, he had forged the names of his trustees to apower of attorney, which enabled him to get possession of some ofthe money which he had inherited from his mother, and had broughtinto marriage settlement. He knew that this forgery had beendiscovered, and that by returning to England he was imperilling hislife. Yet he returned. Should one wonder? It was said that thewoman was very beautiful. Besides, she did not love him.It was by a mere accident that he was discovered. A noise in thestreet attracted his attention, and, in his artistic interest inmodern life, he pushed aside the blind for a moment. Some oneoutside called out, 'That's Wainewright, the Bank-forger.' It wasForrester, the Bow Street runner.On the 5th of July he was brought up at the Old Bailey. Thefollowing report of the proceedings appeared in the Times:-Before Mr. Justice Vaughan and Mr. Baron Alderson, Thomas GriffithsWainewright, aged forty-two, a man of gentlemanly appearance,wearing mustachios, was indicted for forging and uttering a certainpower of attorney for 2259 pounds, with intent to defraud theGovernor and Company of the Bank of England.There were five indictments against the prisoner, to all of whichhe pleaded not guilty, when he was arraigned before Mr. SerjeantArabin in the course of the morning. On being brought before thejudges, however, he begged to be allowed to withdraw the formerplea, and then pleaded guilty to two of the indictments which werenot of a capital nature.The counsel for the Bank having explained that there were threeother indictments, but that the Bank did not desire to shed blood,the plea of guilty on the two minor charges was recorded, and theprisoner at the close of the session sentenced by the Recorder totransportation for life.He was taken back to Newgate, preparatory to his removal to thecolonies. In a fanciful passage in one of his early essays he hadfancied himself 'lying in Horsemonger Gaol under sentence of death'for having been unable to resist the temptation of stealing someMarc Antonios from the British Museum in order to complete hiscollection. The sentence now passed on him was to a man of hisculture a form of death. He complained bitterly of it to hisfriends, and pointed out, with a good deal of reason, some peoplemay fancy, that the money was practically his own, having come tohim from his mother, and that the forgery, such as it was, had beencommitted thirteen years before, which, to use his own phrase, wasat least a circonstance attenuante. The permanence of personalityis a very subtle metaphysical problem, and certainly the Englishlaw solves the question in an extremely rough-and-ready manner.There is, however, something dramatic in the fact that this heavypunishment was inflicted on him for what, if we remember his fatalinfluence on the prose of modern journalism, was certainly not theworst of all his sins.While he was in gaol, Dickens, Macready, and Hablot Browne cameacross him by chance. They had been going over the prisons ofLondon, searching for artistic effects, and in Newgate theysuddenly caught sight of Wainewright. He met them with a defiantstare, Forster tells us, but Macready was 'horrified to recognise aman familiarly known to him in former years, and at whose table hehad dined.'Others had more curiosity, and his cell was for some time a kind offashionable lounge. Many men of letters went down to visit theirold literary comrade. But he was no longer the kind light-heartedJanus whom Charles Lamb admired. He seems to have grown quitecynical.To the agent of an insurance company who was visiting him oneafternoon, and thought he would improve the occasion by pointingout that, after all, crime was a bad speculation, he replied:'Sir, you City men enter on your speculations, and take the chancesof them. Some of your speculations succeed, some fail. Minehappen to have failed, yours happen to have succeeded. That is theonly difference, sir, between my visitor and me. But, sir, I willtell you one thing in which I have succeeded to the last. I havebeen determined through life to hold the position of a gentleman.I have always done so. I do so still. It is the custom of thisplace that each of the inmates of a cell shall take his morning'sturn of sweeping it out. I occupy a cell with a bricklayer and asweep, but they never offer me the broom!' When a friendreproached him with the murder of Helen Abercrombie he shrugged hisshoulders and said, 'Yes; it was a dreadful thing to do, but shehad very thick ankles.'From Newgate he was brought to the hulks at Portsmouth, and sentfrom there in the Susan to Van Diemen's Land along with threehundred other convicts. The voyage seems to have been mostdistasteful to him, and in a letter written to a friend he spokebitterly about the ignominy of 'the companion of poets and artists'being compelled to associate with 'country bumpkins.' The phrasethat he applies to his companions need not surprise us. Crime inEngland is rarely the result of sin. It is nearly always theresult of starvation. There was probably no one on board in whomhe would have found a sympathetic listener, or even apsychologically interesting nature.His love of art, however, never deserted him. At Hobart Town hestarted a studio, and returned to sketching and portrait-painting,and his conversation and manners seem not to have lost their charm.Nor did he give up his habit of poisoning, and there are two caseson record in which he tried to make away with people who hadoffended him. But his hand seems to have lost its cunning. Bothof his attempts were complete failures, and in 1844, beingthoroughly dissatisfied with Tasmanian society, he presented amemorial to the governor of the settlement, Sir John EardleyWilmot, praying for a ticket-of-leave. In it he speaks of himselfas being 'tormented by ideas struggling for outward form andrealisation, barred up from increase of knowledge, and deprived ofthe exercise of profitable or even of decorous speech.' Hisrequest, however, was refused, and the associate of Coleridgeconsoled himself by making those marvellous Paradis Artificielswhose secret is only known to the eaters of opium. In 1852 he diedof apoplexy, his sole living companion being a cat, for which hehad evinced at extraordinary affection.His crimes seem to have had an important effect upon his art. Theygave a strong personality to his style, a quality that his earlywork certainly lacked. In a note to the Life of Dickens, Forstermentions that in 1847 Lady Blessington received from her brother,Major Power, who held a military appointment at Hobart Town, an oilportrait of a young lady from his clever brush; and it is said that'he had contrived to put the expression of his own wickedness intothe portrait of a nice, kind-hearted girl.' M. Zola, in one of hisnovels, tells us of a young man who, having committed a murder,takes to art, and paints greenish impressionist portraits ofperfectly respectable people, all of which bear a curiousresemblance to his victim. The development of Mr. Wainewright'sstyle seems to me far more subtle and suggestive. One can fancy anintense personality being created out of sin.This strange and fascinating figure that for a few years dazzledliterary London, and made so brilliant a debut in life and letters,is undoubtedly a most interesting study. Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt, hislatest biographer, to whom I am indebted for many of the factscontained in this memoir, and whose little book is, indeed, quiteinvaluable in its way, is of opinion that his love of art andnature was a mere pretence and assumption, and others have deniedto him all literary power. This seems to me a shallow, or at leasta mistaken, view. The fact of a man being a poisoner is nothingagainst his prose. The domestic virtues are not the true basis ofart, though they may serve as an excellent advertisement forsecond-rate artists. It is possible that De Quincey exaggeratedhis critical powers, and I cannot help saying again that there ismuch in his published works that is too familiar, too common, toojournalistic, in the bad sense of that bad word. Here and there heis distinctly vulgar in expression, and he is always lacking in theself-restraint of the true artist. But for some of his faults wemust blame the time in which he lived, and, after all, prose thatCharles Lamb thought 'capital' has no small historic interest.That he had a sincere love of art and nature seems to me quitecertain. There is no essential incongruity between crime andculture. We cannot re-write the whole of history for the purposeof gratifying our moral sense of what should be.Of course, he is far too close to our own time for us to be able toform any purely artistic judgment about him. It is impossible notto feel a strong prejudice against a man who might have poisonedLord Tennyson, or Mr. Gladstone, or the Master of Balliol. But hadthe man worn a costume and spoken a language different from ourown, had he lived in imperial Rome, or at the time of the ItalianRenaissance, or in Spain in the seventeenth century, or in any landor any century but this century and this land, we would be quiteable to arrive at a perfectly unprejudiced estimate of his positionand value. I know that there are many historians, or at leastwriters on historical subjects, who still think it necessary toapply moral judgments to history, and who distribute their praiseor blame with the solemn complacency of a successful schoolmaster.This, however, is a foolish habit, and merely shows that the moralinstinct can be brought to such a pitch of perfection that it willmake its appearance wherever it is not required. Nobody with thetrue historical sense ever dreams of blaming Nero, or scoldingTiberius, or censuring Caesar Borgia. These personages have becomelike the puppets of a play. They may fill us with terror, orhorror, or wonder, but they do not harm us. They are not inimmediate relation to us. We have nothing to fear from them. Theyhave passed into the sphere of art and science, and neither art norscience knows anything of moral approval or disapproval. And so itmay be some day with Charles Lamb's friend. At present I feel thathe is just a little too modern to be treated in that fine spirit ofdisinterested curiosity to which we owe so many charming studies ofthe great criminals of the Italian Renaissance from the pens of Mr.John Addington Symonds, Miss A. Mary F. Robinson, Miss Vernon Lee,and other distinguished writers. However, Art has not forgottenhim. He is the hero of Dickens's Hunted Down, the Varney ofBulwer's Lucretia; and it is gratifying to note that fiction haspaid some homage to one who was so powerful with 'pen, pencil andpoison.' To be suggestive for fiction is to be of more importancethan a fact.
