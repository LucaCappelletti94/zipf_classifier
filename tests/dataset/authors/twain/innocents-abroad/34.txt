Mosques are plenty, churches are plenty, graveyards are plenty, butmorals and whiskey are scarce. The Koran does not permit Mohammedans todrink. Their natural instincts do not permit them to be moral. They saythe Sultan has eight hundred wives. This almost amounts to bigamy. Itmakes our cheeks burn with shame to see such a thing permitted here inTurkey. We do not mind it so much in Salt Lake, however.
Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in Constantinople by theirparents, but not publicly. The great slave marts we have all read somuch about--where tender young girls were stripped for inspection, andcriticised and discussed just as if they were horses at an agriculturalfair--no longer exist. The exhibition and the sales are private now.Stocks are up, just at present, partly because of a brisk demand createdby the recent return of the Sultan's suite from the courts of Europe;partly on account of an unusual abundance of bread-stuffs, which leavesholders untortured by hunger and enables them to hold back for highprices; and partly because buyers are too weak to bear the market, whilesellers are amply prepared to bull it. Under these circumstances, if theAmerican metropolitan newspapers were published here in Constantinople,their next commercial report would read about as follows, I suppose: 
                        SLAVE GIRL MARKET REPORT.
     "Best brands Circassians, crop of 1850, L200; 1852, L250; 1854,     L300.  Best brands Georgian, none in market; second quality, 1851,     L180.  Nineteen fair to middling Wallachian girls offered at L130 @     150, but no takers; sixteen prime A 1 sold in small lots to close     out--terms private.
     "Sales of one lot Circassians, prime to good, 1852 to 1854, at L240     @ 242, buyer 30; one forty-niner--damaged--at L23, seller ten, no     deposit.  Several Georgians, fancy brands, 1852, changed hands to     fill orders.  The Georgians now on hand are mostly last year's crop,     which was unusually poor.  The new crop is a little backward, but     will be coming in shortly.  As regards its quantity and quality, the     accounts are most encouraging.  In this connection we can safely     say, also, that the new crop of Circassians is looking extremely     well.  His Majesty the Sultan has already sent in large orders for     his new harem, which will be finished within a fortnight, and this     has naturally strengthened the market and given Circassian stock a     strong upward tendency.  Taking advantage of the inflated market,     many of our shrewdest operators are selling short.  There are hints     of a 'corner' on Wallachians.
     "There is nothing new in Nubians.  Slow sale.
     "Eunuchs--None offering; however, large cargoes are expected from     Egypt today."

I think the above would be about the style of the commercial report.Prices are pretty high now, and holders firm; but, two or three yearsago, parents in a starving condition brought their young daughters downhere and sold them for even twenty and thirty dollars, when they could dono better, simply to save themselves and the girls from dying of want.It is sad to think of so distressing a thing as this, and I for one amsincerely glad the prices are up again.
Commercial morals, especially, are bad. There is no gainsaying that.Greek, Turkish and Armenian morals consist only in attending churchregularly on the appointed Sabbaths, and in breaking the ten commandmentsall the balance of the week. It comes natural to them to lie and cheatin the first place, and then they go on and improve on nature until theyarrive at perfection. In recommending his son to a merchant as avaluable salesman, a father does not say he is a nice, moral, uprightboy, and goes to Sunday School and is honest, but he says, "This boy isworth his weight in broad pieces of a hundred--for behold, he will cheatwhomsoever hath dealings with him, and from the Euxine to the waters ofMarmora there abideth not so gifted a liar!" How is that for arecommendation? The Missionaries tell me that they hear encomiums likethat passed upon people every day. They say of a person they admire,"Ah, he is a charming swindler, and a most exquisite liar!"
Every body lies and cheats--every body who is in business, at any rate.Even foreigners soon have to come down to the custom of the country, andthey do not buy and sell long in Constantinople till they lie and cheatlike a Greek. I say like a Greek, because the Greeks are called theworst transgressors in this line. Several Americans long resident inConstantinople contend that most Turks are pretty trustworthy, but fewclaim that the Greeks have any virtues that a man can discover--at leastwithout a fire assay.
I am half willing to believe that the celebrated dogs of Constantinoplehave been misrepresented--slandered. I have always been led to supposethat they were so thick in the streets that they blocked the way; thatthey moved about in organized companies, platoons and regiments, and tookwhat they wanted by determined and ferocious assault; and that at nightthey drowned all other sounds with their terrible howlings. The dogs Isee here can not be those I have read of.
I find them every where, but not in strong force. The most I have foundtogether has been about ten or twenty. And night or day a fairproportion of them were sound asleep. Those that were not asleep alwayslooked as if they wanted to be. I never saw such utterly wretched,starving, sad-visaged, broken-hearted looking curs in my life. It seemeda grim satire to accuse such brutes as these of taking things by force ofarms. They hardly seemed to have strength enough or ambition enough towalk across the street--I do not know that I have seen one walk that faryet. They are mangy and bruised and mutilated, and often you see onewith the hair singed off him in such wide and well defined tracts that helooks like a map of the new Territories. They are the sorriest beaststhat breathe--the most abject--the most pitiful. In their faces is asettled expression of melancholy, an air of hopeless despondency. Thehairless patches on a scalded dog are preferred by the fleas ofConstantinople to a wider range on a healthier dog; and the exposedplaces suit the fleas exactly. I saw a dog of this kind start to nibbleat a flea--a fly attracted his attention, and he made a snatch at him;the flea called for him once more, and that forever unsettled him; helooked sadly at his flea-pasture, then sadly looked at his bald spot.Then he heaved a sigh and dropped his head resignedly upon his paws. Hewas not equal to the situation.
The dogs sleep in the streets, all over the city. From one end of thestreet to the other, I suppose they will average about eight or ten to ablock. Sometimes, of course, there are fifteen or twenty to a block.They do not belong to any body, and they seem to have no close personalfriendships among each other. But they district the city themselves, andthe dogs of each district, whether it be half a block in extent, or tenblocks, have to remain within its bounds. Woe to a dog if he crosses theline! His neighbors would snatch the balance of his hair off in asecond. So it is said. But they don't look it.
They sleep in the streets these days. They are my compass--my guide.When I see the dogs sleep placidly on, while men, sheep, geese, and allmoving things turn out and go around them, I know I am not in the greatstreet where the hotel is, and must go further. In the Grand Rue thedogs have a sort of air of being on the lookout--an air born of beingobliged to get out of the way of many carriages every day--and thatexpression one recognizes in a moment. It does not exist upon the faceof any dog without the confines of that street. All others sleepplacidly and keep no watch. They would not move, though the Sultanhimself passed by.
In one narrow street (but none of them are wide) I saw three dogs lyingcoiled up, about a foot or two apart. End to end they lay, and so theyjust bridged the street neatly, from gutter to gutter. A drove of ahundred sheep came along. They stepped right over the dogs, the rearcrowding the front, impatient to get on. The dogs looked lazily up,flinched a little when the impatient feet of the sheep touched their rawbacks--sighed, and lay peacefully down again. No talk could be plainerthan that. So some of the sheep jumped over them and others scrambledbetween, occasionally chipping a leg with their sharp hoofs, and when thewhole flock had made the trip, the dogs sneezed a little, in the cloud ofdust, but never budged their bodies an inch. I thought I was lazy, but Iam a steam-engine compared to a Constantinople dog. But was not that asingular scene for a city of a million inhabitants?
These dogs are the scavengers of the city. That is their officialposition, and a hard one it is. However, it is their protection. Butfor their usefulness in partially cleansing these terrible streets, theywould not be tolerated long. They eat any thing and every thing thatcomes in their way, from melon rinds and spoiled grapes up through allthe grades and species of dirt and refuse to their own dead friends andrelatives--and yet they are always lean, always hungry, alwaysdespondent. The people are loath to kill them--do not kill them, infact. The Turks have an innate antipathy to taking the life of any dumbanimal, it is said. But they do worse. They hang and kick and stone andscald these wretched creatures to the very verge of death, and then leavethem to live and suffer.
Once a Sultan proposed to kill off all the dogs here, and did begin thework--but the populace raised such a howl of horror about it that themassacre was stayed. After a while, he proposed to remove them all to anisland in the Sea of Marmora. No objection was offered, and a ship-loador so was taken away. But when it came to be known that somehow or otherthe dogs never got to the island, but always fell overboard in the nightand perished, another howl was raised and the transportation scheme wasdropped.
So the dogs remain in peaceable possession of the streets. I do not saythat they do not howl at night, nor that they do not attack people whohave not a red fez on their heads. I only say that it would be mean forme to accuse them of these unseemly things who have not seen them do themwith my own eyes or heard them with my own ears.
I was a little surprised to see Turks and Greeks playing newsboy righthere in the mysterious land where the giants and genii of the ArabianNights once dwelt--where winged horses and hydra-headed dragons guardedenchanted castles--where Princes and Princesses flew through the air oncarpets that obeyed a mystic talisman--where cities whose houses weremade of precious stones sprang up in a night under the hand of themagician, and where busy marts were suddenly stricken with a spell andeach citizen lay or sat, or stood with weapon raised or foot advanced,just as he was, speechless and motionless, till time had told a hundredyears!
It was curious to see newsboys selling papers in so dreamy a land asthat. And, to say truly, it is comparatively a new thing here. Theselling of newspapers had its birth in Constantinople about a year ago,and was a child of the Prussian and Austrian war.
There is one paper published here in the English language--The LevantHerald--and there are generally a number of Greek and a few French papersrising and falling, struggling up and falling again. Newspapers are notpopular with the Sultan's Government. They do not understand journalism.The proverb says, "The unknown is always great." To the court, thenewspaper is a mysterious and rascally institution. They know what apestilence is, because they have one occasionally that thins the peopleout at the rate of two thousand a day, and they regard a newspaper as amild form of pestilence. When it goes astray, they suppress it--pounceupon it without warning, and throttle it. When it don't go astray for along time, they get suspicious and throttle it anyhow, because they thinkit is hatching deviltry. Imagine the Grand Vizier in solemn council withthe magnates of the realm, spelling his way through the hated newspaper,and finally delivering his profound decision: "This thing means mischief--it is too darkly, too suspiciously inoffensive--suppress it! Warn thepublisher that we can not have this sort of thing: put the editor inprison!"
The newspaper business has its inconveniences in Constantinople. TwoGreek papers and one French one were suppressed here within a few days ofeach other. No victories of the Cretans are allowed to be printed. Fromtime to time the Grand Vizier sends a notice to the various editors thatthe Cretan insurrection is entirely suppressed, and although that editorknows better, he still has to print the notice. The Levant Herald is toofond of speaking praisefully of Americans to be popular with the Sultan,who does not relish our sympathy with the Cretans, and therefore thatpaper has to be particularly circumspect in order to keep out of trouble.Once the editor, forgetting the official notice in his paper that theCretans were crushed out, printed a letter of a very different tenor,from the American Consul in Crete, and was fined two hundred and fiftydollars for it. Shortly he printed another from the same source and wasimprisoned three months for his pains. I think I could get the assistanteditorship of the Levant Herald, but I am going to try to worry alongwithout it.
To suppress a paper here involves the ruin of the publisher, almost. Butin Naples I think they speculate on misfortunes of that kind. Papers aresuppressed there every day, and spring up the next day under a new name.During the ten days or a fortnight we staid there one paper was murderedand resurrected twice. The newsboys are smart there, just as they areelsewhere. They take advantage of popular weaknesses. When they findthey are not likely to sell out, they approach a citizen mysteriously,and say in a low voice--"Last copy, sir: double price; paper just beensuppressed!" The man buys it, of course, and finds nothing in it. Theydo say--I do not vouch for it--but they do say that men sometimes print avast edition of a paper, with a ferociously seditious article in it,distribute it quickly among the newsboys, and clear out till theGovernment's indignation cools. It pays well. Confiscation don't amountto any thing. The type and presses are not worth taking care of.
There is only one English newspaper in Naples. It has seventysubscribers. The publisher is getting rich very deliberately--verydeliberately indeed.
I never shall want another Turkish lunch. The cooking apparatus was inthe little lunch room, near the bazaar, and it was all open to thestreet. The cook was slovenly, and so was the table, and it had no clothon it. The fellow took a mass of sausage meat and coated it round a wireand laid it on a charcoal fire to cook. When it was done, he laid itaside and a dog walked sadly in and nipped it. He smelt it first, andprobably recognized the remains of a friend. The cook took it away fromhim and laid it before us. Jack said, "I pass"--he plays euchresometimes--and we all passed in turn. Then the cook baked a broad, flat,wheaten cake, greased it well with the sausage, and started towards uswith it. It dropped in the dirt, and he picked it up and polished it onhis breeches, and laid it before us. Jack said, "I pass." We allpassed. He put some eggs in a frying pan, and stood pensively pryingslabs of meat from between his teeth with a fork. Then he used the forkto turn the eggs with--and brought them along. Jack said "Pass again."All followed suit. We did not know what to do, and so we ordered a newration of sausage. The cook got out his wire, apportioned a properamount of sausage-meat, spat it on his hands and fell to work! Thistime, with one accord, we all passed out. We paid and left. That isall I learned about Turkish lunches. A Turkish lunch is good, no doubt,but it has its little drawbacks.
When I think how I have been swindled by books of Oriental travel, I wanta tourist for breakfast. For years and years I have dreamed of thewonders of the Turkish bath; for years and years I have promised myselfthat I would yet enjoy one. Many and many a time, in fancy, I have lainin the marble bath, and breathed the slumbrous fragrance of Easternspices that filled the air; then passed through a weird and complicatedsystem of pulling and hauling, and drenching and scrubbing, by a gang ofnaked savages who loomed vast and vaguely through the steaming mists,like demons; then rested for a while on a divan fit for a king; thenpassed through another complex ordeal, and one more fearful than thefirst; and, finally, swathed in soft fabrics, been conveyed to a princelysaloon and laid on a bed of eider down, where eunuchs, gorgeous ofcostume, fanned me while I drowsed and dreamed, or contentedly gazed atthe rich hangings of the apartment, the soft carpets, the sumptuousfurniture, the pictures, and drank delicious coffee, smoked the soothingnarghili, and dropped, at the last, into tranquil repose, lulled bysensuous odors from unseen censers, by the gentle influence of thenarghili's Persian tobacco, and by the music of fountains thatcounterfeited the pattering of summer rain.
That was the picture, just as I got it from incendiary books of travel.It was a poor, miserable imposture. The reality is no more like it thanthe Five Points are like the Garden of Eden. They received me in a greatcourt, paved with marble slabs; around it were broad galleries, one aboveanother, carpeted with seedy matting, railed with unpainted balustrades,and furnished with huge rickety chairs, cushioned with rusty oldmattresses, indented with impressions left by the forms of ninesuccessive generations of men who had reposed upon them. The place wasvast, naked, dreary; its court a barn, its galleries stalls for humanhorses. The cadaverous, half nude varlets that served in theestablishment had nothing of poetry in their appearance, nothing ofromance, nothing of Oriental splendor. They shed no entrancing odors--just the contrary. Their hungry eyes and their lank forms continuallysuggested one glaring, unsentimental fact--they wanted what they term inCalifornia "a square meal."
I went into one of the racks and undressed. An unclean starvelingwrapped a gaudy table-cloth about his loins, and hung a white rag over myshoulders. If I had had a tub then, it would have come natural to me totake in washing. I was then conducted down stairs into the wet, slipperycourt, and the first things that attracted my attention were my heels.My fall excited no comment. They expected it, no doubt. It belonged inthe list of softening, sensuous influences peculiar to this home ofEastern luxury. It was softening enough, certainly, but its applicationwas not happy. They now gave me a pair of wooden clogs--benches inminiature, with leather straps over them to confine my feet (which theywould have done, only I do not wear No. 13s.) These things dangleduncomfortably by the straps when I lifted up my feet, and came down inawkward and unexpected places when I put them on the floor again, andsometimes turned sideways and wrenched my ankles out of joint. However,it was all Oriental luxury, and I did what I could to enjoy it.
They put me in another part of the barn and laid me on a stuffy sort ofpallet, which was not made of cloth of gold, or Persian shawls, but wasmerely the unpretending sort of thing I have seen in the negro quartersof Arkansas. There was nothing whatever in this dim marble prison butfive more of these biers. It was a very solemn place. I expected thatthe spiced odors of Araby were going to steal over my senses now, butthey did not. A copper-colored skeleton, with a rag around him, broughtme a glass decanter of water, with a lighted tobacco pipe in the top ofit, and a pliant stem a yard long, with a brass mouth-piece to it.
It was the famous "narghili" of the East--the thing the Grand Turk smokesin the pictures. This began to look like luxury. I took one blast atit, and it was sufficient; the smoke went in a great volume down into mystomach, my lungs, even into the uttermost parts of my frame. I explodedone mighty cough, and it was as if Vesuvius had let go. For the nextfive minutes I smoked at every pore, like a frame house that is on fireon the inside. Not any more narghili for me. The smoke had a viletaste, and the taste of a thousand infidel tongues that remained on thatbrass mouthpiece was viler still. I was getting discouraged. Whenever,hereafter, I see the cross-legged Grand Turk smoking his narghili, inpretended bliss, on the outside of a paper of Connecticut tobacco, Ishall know him for the shameless humbug he is.
This prison was filled with hot air. When I had got warmed upsufficiently to prepare me for a still warmer temperature, they took mewhere it was--into a marble room, wet, slippery and steamy, and laid meout on a raised platform in the centre. It was very warm. Presently myman sat me down by a tank of hot water, drenched me well, gloved his handwith a coarse mitten, and began to polish me all over with it. I beganto smell disagreeably. The more he polished the worse I smelt. It wasalarming. I said to him:
"I perceive that I am pretty far gone. It is plain that I ought to beburied without any unnecessary delay. Perhaps you had better go after myfriends at once, because the weather is warm, and I can not 'keep' long."
He went on scrubbing, and paid no attention. I soon saw that he wasreducing my size. He bore hard on his mitten, and from under it rolledlittle cylinders, like maccaroni. It could not be dirt, for it was toowhite. He pared me down in this way for a long time. Finally I said:
"It is a tedious process. It will take hours to trim me to the size youwant me; I will wait; go and borrow a jack-plane."
He paid no attention at all.
After a while he brought a basin, some soap, and something that seemed tobe the tail of a horse. He made up a prodigious quantity of soap-suds,deluged me with them from head to foot, without warning me to shut myeyes, and then swabbed me viciously with the horse-tail. Then he left methere, a snowy statue of lather, and went away. When I got tired ofwaiting I went and hunted him up. He was propped against the wall, inanother room, asleep. I woke him. He was not disconcerted. He took meback and flooded me with hot water, then turbaned my head, swathed mewith dry table-cloths, and conducted me to a latticed chicken-coop in oneof the galleries, and pointed to one of those Arkansas beds. I mountedit, and vaguely expected the odors of Araby a gain. They did not come.
The blank, unornamented coop had nothing about it of that orientalvoluptuousness one reads of so much. It was more suggestive of thecounty hospital than any thing else. The skinny servitor brought anarghili, and I got him to take it out again without wasting any timeabout it. Then he brought the world-renowned Turkish coffee that poetshave sung so rapturously for many generations, and I seized upon it asthe last hope that was left of my old dreams of Eastern luxury. It wasanother fraud. Of all the unchristian beverages that ever passed mylips, Turkish coffee is the worst. The cup is small, it is smeared withgrounds; the coffee is black, thick, unsavory of smell, and execrable intaste. The bottom of the cup has a muddy sediment in it half an inchdeep. This goes down your throat, and portions of it lodge by the way,and produce a tickling aggravation that keeps you barking and coughingfor an hour.
Here endeth my experience of the celebrated Turkish bath, and here alsoendeth my dream of the bliss the mortal revels in who passes through it.It is a malignant swindle. The man who enjoys it is qualified to enjoyany thing that is repulsive to sight or sense, and he that can invest itwith a charm of poetry is able to do the same with any thing else in theworld that is tedious, and wretched, and dismal, and nasty.
