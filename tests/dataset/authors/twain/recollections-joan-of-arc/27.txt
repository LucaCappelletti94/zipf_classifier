We Burst In Upon Ghosts
BEING WORN out with the long fight, we all slept the rest of theafternoon away and two or three hours into the night. Then we got uprefreshed, and had supper. As for me, I could have been willing to letthe matter of the ghost drop; and the others were of a like mind, nodoubt, for they talked diligently of the battle and said nothing of thatother thing. And indeed it was fine and stirring to hear the Paladinrehearse his deeds and see him pile his dead, fifteen here, eighteenthere, and thirty-five yonder; but this only postponed the trouble; itcould not do more. He could not go on forever; when he had carried thebastille by assault and eaten up the garrison there was nothing for itbut to stop, unless Catherine Boucher would give him a new start and haveit all done over again--as we hoped she would, this time--but she wasotherwise minded. As soon as there was a good opening and a fair chance,she brought up her unwelcome subject, and we faced it the best we could.
We followed her and her parents to the haunted room at eleven o'clock,with candles, and also with torches to place in the sockets on the walls.It was a big house, with very thick walls, and this room was in a remotepart of it which had been left unoccupied for nobody knew how many years,because of its evil repute.
This was a large room, like a salon, and had a big table in it ofenduring oak and well preserved; but the chair were worm-eaten and thetapestry on the walls was rotten and discolored by age. The dusty cobwebsunder the ceiling had the look of not having had any business for acentury.
Catherine said:
"Tradition says that these ghosts have never been seen--they have merelybeen heard. It is plain that this room was once larger than it is now,and that the wall at this end was built in some bygone time to make andfence off a narrow room there. There is no communication anywhere withthat narrow room, and if it exists--and of that there is no reasonabledoubt--it has no light and no air, but is an absolute dungeon. Wait whereyou are, and take note of what happens."
That was all. Then she and her parents left us. When their footfalls haddied out in the distance down the empty stone corridors an uncannysilence and solemnity ensued which was dismaler to me than the mute marchpast the bastilles. We sat looking vacantly at each other, and it waseasy to see that no one there was comfortable. The longer we sat so, themore deadly still that stillness got to be; and when the wind began tomoan around the house presently, it made me sick and miserable, and Iwished I had been brave enough to be a coward this time, for indeed it isno proper shame to be afraid of ghosts, seeing how helpless the livingare in their hands. And then these ghosts were invisible, which made thematter the worse, as it seemed to me. They might be in the room with usat that moment--we could not know. I felt airy touches on my shouldersand my hair, and I shrank from them and cringed, and was not ashamed toshow this fear, for I saw the others doing the like, and knew that theywere feeling those faint contacts too. As this went on--oh, eternities itseemed, the time dragged so drearily--all those faces became as wax, andI seemed sitting with a congress of the dead.
At last, faint and far and weird and slow, came a"boom!--boom!--boom!"--a distant bell tolling midnight. When the laststroke died, that depressing stillness followed again, and as before Iwas staring at those waxen faces and feeling those airy touches on myhair and my shoulders once more.
One minute--two minutes--three minutes of this, then we heard a long deepgroan, and everybody sprang up and stood, with his legs quaking. It camefrom that little dungeon. There was a pause, then we herd muffledsobbings, mixed with pitiful ejaculations. Then there was a second voice,low and not distinct, and the one seemed trying to comfort the other; andso the two voices went on, with moanings, and soft sobbings, and, ah, thetones were so full of compassion and sorry and despair! Indeed, it madeone's heart sore to hear it.
But those sounds were so real and so human and so moving that the idea ofghosts passed straight out of our minds, and Sir Jean de Metz spoke outand said:
"Come! we will smash that wall and set those poor captives free. Here,with your ax!"
The Dwarf jumped forward, swinging his great ax with both hands, andothers sprang for torches and brought them.
Bang!--whang!--slam!--smash went the ancient bricks, and there was a holean ox could pass through. We plunged within and held up the torches.
Nothing there but vacancy! On the floor lay a rusty sword and a rottenfan.
Now you know all that I know. Take the pathetic relics, and weave aboutthem the romance of the dungeon's long-vanished inmates as best you can.
