We rummaged the clothes we'd got, and found eightdollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanketovercoat. Jim said he reckoned the people in thathouse stole the coat, because if they'd a knowed themoney was there they wouldn't a left it. I said Ireckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn't want totalk about that. I says:
"Now you think it's bad luck; but what did yousay when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found onthe top of the ridge day before yesterday? You saidit was the worst bad luck in the world to touch asnake-skin with my hands. Well, here's your badluck! We've raked in all this truck and eight dollarsbesides. I wish we could have some bad luck like thisevery day, Jim."
"Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don'tyou git too peart. It's a-comin'. Mind I tell you,it's a-comin'."
It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we hadthat talk. Well, after dinner Friday we was layingaround in the grass at the upper end of the ridge, andgot out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some,and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, andcurled him up on the foot of Jim's blanket, ever sonatural, thinking there'd be some fun when Jim foundhim there. Well, by night I forgot all about thesnake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanketwhile I struck a light the snake's mate was there, andbit him.
He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the lightshowed was the varmint curled up and ready foranother spring. I laid him out in a second with astick, and Jim grabbed pap's whisky-jug and begun topour it down.
He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right onthe heel. That all comes of my being such a fool asto not remember that wherever you leave a dead snakeits mate always comes there and curls around it. Jimtold me to chop off the snake's head and throw itaway, and then skin the body and roast a piece of it.I done it, and he eat it and said it would help curehim. He made me take off the rattles and tie themaround his wrist, too. He said that that would help.Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clearaway amongst the bushes; for I warn't going to letJim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.
Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and thenhe got out of his head and pitched around and yelled;but every time he come to himself he went to suckingat the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, andso did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun tocome, and so I judged he was all right; but I'ddruther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky.
Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Thenthe swelling was all gone and he was around again. Imade up my mind I wouldn't ever take a-holt of asnake-skin again with my hands, now that I see whathad come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believehim next time. And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn'tgot to the end of it yet. He said he druther see thenew moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousandtimes than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, Iwas getting to feel that way myself, though I've alwaysreckoned that looking at the new moon over your leftshoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest thingsa body can do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, andbragged about it; and in less than two years he gotdrunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread him-self out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as youmay say; and they slid him edgeways between twobarn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so theysay, but I didn't see it. Pap told me. But anywayit all come of looking at the moon that way, like afool.
Well, the days went along, and the river went downbetween its banks again; and about the first thing wedone was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinnedrabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big asa man, being six foot two inches long, and weighedover two hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him,of course; he would a flung us into Illinois. We justset there and watched him rip and tear around till hedrownded. We found a brass button in his stomachand a round ball, and lots of rubbage. We split theball open with the hatchet, and there was a spool in it.Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to coat it overso and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish as wasever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said hehadn't ever seen a bigger one. He would a beenworth a good deal over at the village. They peddleout such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat'sas white as snow and makes a good fry.
Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull,and I wanted to get a stirring up some way. I said Ireckoned I would slip over the river and find out whatwas going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said Imust go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studiedit over and said, couldn't I put on some of them oldthings and dress up like a girl? That was a goodnotion, too. So we shortened up one of the calicogowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my kneesand got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks,and it was a fair fit. I put on the sun-bonnet and tiedit under my chin, and then for a body to look in andsee my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in thedaytime, hardly. I practiced around all day to getthe hang of the things, and by and by I could dopretty well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like agirl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown toget at my britches-pocket. I took notice, and donebetter.
I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just afterdark.
I started across to the town from a little below theferry-landing, and the drift of the current fetched mein at the bottom of the town. I tied up and startedalong the bank. There was a light burning in a littleshanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and Iwondered who had took up quarters there. I slippedup and peeped in at the window. There was a womanabout forty year old in there knitting by a candle thatwas on a pine table. I didn't know her face; she wasa stranger, for you couldn't start a face in that townthat I didn't know. Now this was lucky, because Iwas weakening; I was getting afraid I had come;people might know my voice and find me out. But ifthis woman had been in such a little town two daysshe could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knockedat the door, and made up my mind I wouldn't forget Iwas a girl.
