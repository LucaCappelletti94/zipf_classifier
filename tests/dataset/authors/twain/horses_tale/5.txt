She has been with us a good nice long time, now.  You are troubledabout your sprite because this is such a wild frontier, hundreds ofmiles from civilization, and peopled only by wandering tribes ofsavages?  You fear for her safety?  Give yourself no uneasinessabout her.  Dear me, she's in a nursery! and she's got more thaneighteen hundred nurses.  It would distress the garrison to suspectthat you think they can't take care of her.  They think they can.They would tell you so themselves.  You see, the Seventh Cavalryhas never had a child of its very own before, and neither has theNinth Dragoons; and so they are like all new mothers, they thinkthere is no other child like theirs, no other child so wonderful,none that is so worthy to be faithfully and tenderly looked afterand protected.  These bronzed veterans of mine are very goodmothers, I think, and wiser than some other mothers; for they lether take lots of risks, and it is a good education for her; and themore risks she takes and comes successfully out of, the prouderthey are of her.  They adopted her, with grave and formal militaryceremonies of their own invention - solemnities is the truer word;solemnities that were so profoundly solemn and earnest, that thespectacle would have been comical if it hadn't been so touching.It was a good show, and as stately and complex as guard-mount andthe trooping of the colors; and it had its own special music,composed for the occasion by the bandmaster of the Seventh; and thechild was as serious as the most serious war-worn soldier of themall; and finally when they throned her upon the shoulder of theoldest veteran, and pronounced her "well and truly adopted," andthe bands struck up and all saluted and she saluted in return, itwas better and more moving than any kindred thing I have seen onthe stage, because stage things are make-believe, but this was realand the players' hearts were in it.
It happened several weeks ago, and was followed by some additionalsolemnities.  The men created a couple of new ranks, thithertounknown to the army regulations, and conferred them upon Cathy,with ceremonies suitable to a duke.  So now she is Corporal-Generalof the Seventh Cavalry, and Flag-Lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons,with the privilege (decreed by the men) of writing U.S.A. after hername!  Also, they presented her a pair of shoulder-straps - bothdark blue, the one with F. L. on it, the other with C. G.  Also, asword.  She wears them.  Finally, they granted her the SALUTE.  Iam witness that that ceremony is faithfully observed by bothparties - and most gravely and decorously, too.  I have never seena soldier smile yet, while delivering it, nor Cathy in returningit.
Ostensibly I was not present at these proceedings, and am ignorantof them; but I was where I could see.  I was afraid of one thing -the jealousy of the other children of the post; but there isnothing of that, I am glad to say.  On the contrary, they are proudof their comrade and her honors.  It is a surprising thing, but itis true.  The children are devoted to Cathy, for she has turnedtheir dull frontier life into a sort of continuous festival; alsothey know her for a stanch and steady friend, a friend who canalways be depended upon, and does not change with the weather.
She has become a rather extraordinary rider, under the tutorship ofa more than extraordinary teacher - BB, which is her pet name forBuffalo Bill.  She pronounces it BEEBY.  He has not only taught herseventeen ways of breaking her neck, but twenty-two ways ofavoiding it.  He has infused into her the best and surestprotection of a horseman - CONFIDENCE.  He did it gradually,systematically, little by little, a step at a time, and each stepmade sure before the next was essayed.  And so he inched her alongup through terrors that had been discounted by training before shereached them, and therefore were not recognizable as terrors whenshe got to them.  Well, she is a daring little rider, now, and isperfect in what she knows of horsemanship.  By-and-by she will knowthe art like a West Point cadet, and will exercise it asfearlessly.  She doesn't know anything about side-saddles.  Doesthat distress you?  And she is a fine performer, without any saddleat all.  Does that discomfort you?  Do not let it; she is not inany danger, I give you my word.
You said that if my heart was old and tired she would refresh it,and you said truly.  I do not know how I got along without her,before.  I was a forlorn old tree, but now that this blossomingvine has wound itself about me and become the life of my life, itis very different.  As a furnisher of business for me and for MammyDorcas she is exhaustlessly competent, but I like my share of itand of course Dorcas likes hers, for Dorcas "raised" George, andCathy is George over again in so many ways that she brings backDorcas's youth and the joys of that long-vanished time.  My fathertried to set Dorcas free twenty years ago, when we still lived inVirginia, but without success; she considered herself a member ofthe family, and wouldn't go.  And so, a member of the family sheremained, and has held that position unchallenged ever since, andholds it now; for when my mother sent her here from San Bernardinowhen we learned that Cathy was coming, she only changed from onedivision of the family to the other.  She has the warm heart of herrace, and its lavish affections, and when Cathy arrived the pairwere mother and child in five minutes, and that is what they are todate and will continue.  Dorcas really thinks she raised George,and that is one of her prides, but perhaps it was a mutual raising,for their ages were the same - thirteen years short of mine.  Butthey were playmates, at any rate; as regards that, there is no roomfor dispute.
Cathy thinks Dorcas is the best Catholic in America except herself.She could not pay any one a higher compliment than that, and Dorcascould not receive one that would please her better.  Dorcas issatisfied that there has never been a more wonderful child thanCathy.  She has conceived the curious idea that Cathy is TWINS, andthat one of them is a boy-twin and failed to get segregated - gotsubmerged, is the idea.  To argue with her that this is nonsense isa waste of breath - her mind is made up, and arguments do notaffect it.  She says:
"Look at her; she loves dolls, and girl-plays, and everything agirl loves, and she's gentle and sweet, and ain't cruel to dumbbrutes - now that's the girl-twin, but she loves boy-plays, anddrums and fifes and soldiering, and rough-riding, and ain't afraidof anybody or anything - and that's the boy-twin; 'deed you needn'ttell ME she's only ONE child; no, sir, she's twins, and one of themgot shet up out of sight.  Out of sight, but that don't make anydifference, that boy is in there, and you can see him look out ofher eyes when her temper is up."
Then Dorcas went on, in her simple and earnest way, to furnishillustrations.
"Look at that raven, Marse Tom.  Would anybody befriend a raven butthat child?  Of course they wouldn't; it ain't natural.  Well, theInjun boy had the raven tied up, and was all the time plaguing itand starving it, and she pitied the po' thing, and tried to buy itfrom the boy, and the tears was in her eyes.  That was the girl-twin, you see.  She offered him her thimble, and he flung it down;she offered him all the doughnuts she had, which was two, and heflung them down; she offered him half a paper of pins, worth fortyravens, and he made a mouth at her and jabbed one of them in theraven's back.  That was the limit, you know.  It called for theother twin.  Her eyes blazed up, and she jumped for him like awild-cat, and when she was done with him she was rags and he wasn'tanything but an allegory.  That was most undoubtedly the othertwin, you see, coming to the front.  No, sir; don't tell ME heain't in there.  I've seen him with my own eyes - and plenty oftimes, at that."
"Allegory?  What is an allegory?"
"I don't know, Marse Tom, it's one of her words; she loves the bigones, you know, and I pick them up from her; they sound good and Ican't help it."
"What happened after she had converted the boy into an allegory?"
"Why, she untied the raven and confiscated him by force and fetchedhim home, and left the doughnuts and things on the ground.  Pettedhim, of course, like she does with every creature.  In two days shehad him so stuck after her that she - well, YOU know how he followsher everywhere, and sets on her shoulder often when she rides herbreakneck rampages - all of which is the girl-twin to the front,you see - and he does what he pleases, and is up to all kinds ofdevilment, and is a perfect nuisance in the kitchen.  Well, theyall stand it, but they wouldn't if it was another person's bird."
Here she began to chuckle comfortably, and presently she said:
"Well, you know, she's a nuisance herself, Miss Cathy is, she IS sobusy, and into everything, like that bird.  It's all just asinnocent, you know, and she don't mean any harm, and is so good anddear; and it ain't her fault, it's her nature; her interest isalways a-working and always red-hot, and she can't keep quiet.Well, yesterday it was 'Please, Miss Cathy, don't do that'; and,'Please, Miss Cathy, let that alone'; and, 'Please, Miss Cathy,don't make so much noise'; and so on and so on, till I reckon I hadfound fault fourteen times in fifteen minutes; then she looked upat me with her big brown eyes that can plead so, and said in thatodd little foreign way that goes to your heart,
"'Please, mammy, make me a compliment."
"And of course you did it, you old fool?"
"Marse Tom, I just grabbed her up to my breast and says, 'Oh, youpo' dear little motherless thing, you ain't got a fault in theworld, and you can do anything you want to, and tear the housedown, and yo' old black mammy won't say a word!'"
"Why, of course, of course - I knew you'd spoil the child."
She brushed away her tears, and said with dignity:
"Spoil the child? spoil THAT child, Marse Tom?  There can't ANYBODYspoil her.  She's the king bee of this post, and everybody pets herand is her slave, and yet, as you know, your own self, she ain'tthe least little bit spoiled."  Then she eased her mind with thisretort:  "Marse Tom, she makes you do anything she wants to, andyou can't deny it; so if she could be spoilt, she'd been spoiltlong ago, because you are the very WORST!  Look at that pile ofcats in your chair, and you sitting on a candle-box, just aspatient; it's because they're her cats."
If Dorcas were a soldier, I could punish her for such largefrankness as that.  I changed the subject, and made her resume herillustrations.  She had scored against me fairly, and I wasn'tgoing to cheapen her victory by disputing it.  She proceeded tooffer this incident in evidence on her twin theory:
"Two weeks ago when she got her finger mashed open, she turnedpretty pale with the pain, but she never said a word.  I took herin my lap, and the surgeon sponged off the blood and took a needleand thread and began to sew it up; it had to have a lot ofstitches, and each one made her scrunch a little, but she never letgo a sound.  At last the surgeon was so full of admiration that hesaid, 'Well, you ARE a brave little thing!' and she said, just asca'm and simple as if she was talking about the weather, 'Thereisn't anybody braver but the Cid!'  You see? it was the boy-twinthat the surgeon was a-dealing with.
"Who is the Cid?"
"I don't know, sir - at least only what she says.  She's alwaystalking about him, and says he was the bravest hero Spain ever had,or any other country.  They have it up and down, the children do,she standing up for the Cid, and they working George Washington forall he is worth."
"Do they quarrel?"
"No; it's only disputing, and bragging, the way children do.  Theywant her to be an American, but she can't be anything but aSpaniard, she says.  You see, her mother was always longing forhome, po' thing! and thinking about it, and so the child is just asmuch a Spaniard as if she'd always lived there.  She thinks sheremembers how Spain looked, but I reckon she don't, because she wasonly a baby when they moved to France.  She is very proud to be aSpaniard."
Does that please you, Mercedes?  Very well, be content; your nieceis loyal to her allegiance:  her mother laid deep the foundationsof her love for Spain, and she will go back to you as good aSpaniard as you are yourself.  She has made me promise to take herto you for a long visit when the War Office retires me.
I attend to her studies myself; has she told you that?  Yes, I amher school-master, and she makes pretty good progress, I think,everything considered.  Everything considered - being translated -means holidays.  But the fact is, she was not born for study, andit comes hard.  Hard for me, too; it hurts me like a physical painto see that free spirit of the air and the sunshine laboring andgrieving over a book; and sometimes when I find her gazing far awaytowards the plain and the blue mountains with the longing in hereyes, I have to throw open the prison doors; I can't help it.  Aquaint little scholar she is, and makes plenty of blunders.  Once Iput the question:
"What does the Czar govern?"
She rested her elbow on her knee and her chin on her hand and tookthat problem under deep consideration.  Presently she looked up andanswered, with a rising inflection implying a shade of uncertainty,
"The dative case?"
Here are a couple of her expositions which were delivered withtranquil confidence:
"CHAPLAIN, diminutive of chap.  LASS is masculine, LASSIE isfeminine."
She is not a genius, you see, but just a normal child; they allmake mistakes of that sort.  There is a glad light in her eye whichis pretty to see when she finds herself able to answer a questionpromptly and accurately, without any hesitation; as, for instance,this morning:
"Cathy dear, what is a cube?"
"Why, a native of Cuba."
She still drops a foreign word into her talk now and then, andthere is still a subtle foreign flavor or fragrance about even herexactest English - and long may this abide! for it has for me acharm that is very pleasant.  Sometimes her English is daintilyprim and bookish and captivating.  She has a child's sweet tooth,but for her health's sake I try to keep its inspirations undercheek.  She is obedient - as is proper for a titled and recognizedmilitary personage, which she is - but the chain presses sometimes.For instance, we were out for a walk, and passed by some bushesthat were freighted with wild goose-berries.  Her face brightenedand she put her hands together and delivered herself of thisspeech, most feelingly:
"Oh, if I was permitted a vice it would be the GOURMANDISE!"
Could I resist that?  No.  I gave her a gooseberry.
You ask about her languages.  They take care of themselves; theywill not get rusty here; our regiments are not made up of nativesalone - far from it.  And she is picking up Indian tonguesdiligently.
