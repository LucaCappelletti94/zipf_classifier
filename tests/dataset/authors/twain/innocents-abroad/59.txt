We were at sea now, for a very long voyage--we were to pass through theentire length of the Levant; through the entire length of theMediterranean proper, also, and then cross the full width of theAtlantic--a voyage of several weeks. We naturally settled down into avery slow, stay-at-home manner of life, and resolved to be quiet,exemplary people, and roam no more for twenty or thirty days. No more,at least, than from stem to stern of the ship. It was a very comfortableprospect, though, for we were tired and needed a long rest.
We were all lazy and satisfied, now, as the meager entries in mynote-book (that sure index, to me, of my condition), prove. What astupid thing a note-book gets to be at sea, any way. Please observe thestyle: 
     "Sunday--Services, as usual, at four bells.  Services at night,     also.  No cards.
     "Monday--Beautiful day, but rained hard.  The cattle purchased at     Alexandria for beef ought to be shingled.  Or else fattened.  The     water stands in deep puddles in the depressions forward of their     after shoulders.  Also here and there all over their backs.  It is     well they are not cows--it would soak in and ruin the milk.  The     poor devil eagle--[Afterwards presented to the Central Park.]--from     Syria looks miserable and droopy in the rain, perched on the forward     capstan.  He appears to have his own opinion of a sea voyage, and if     it were put into language and the language solidified, it would     probably essentially dam the widest river in the world.
     "Tuesday--Somewhere in the neighborhood of the island of Malta.  Can     not stop there.  Cholera.  Weather very stormy.  Many passengers     seasick and invisible.
     "Wednesday--Weather still very savage.  Storm blew two land birds to     sea, and they came on board.  A hawk was blown off, also.  He     circled round and round the ship, wanting to light, but afraid of     the people.  He was so tired, though, that he had to light, at last,     or perish.  He stopped in the foretop, repeatedly, and was as often     blown away by the wind.  At last Harry caught him.  Sea full of     flying-fish.  They rise in flocks of three hundred and flash along     above the tops of the waves a distance of two or three hundred feet,     then fall and disappear.
     "Thursday--Anchored off Algiers, Africa.  Beautiful city, beautiful     green hilly landscape behind it.  Staid half a day and left.  Not     permitted to land, though we showed a clean bill of health.  They     were afraid of Egyptian plague and cholera.
     "Friday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,     promenading the deck.  Afterwards, charades.
     "Saturday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,     promenading the decks.  Afterwards, dominoes.
     "Sunday--Morning service, four bells.  Evening service, eight bells.     Monotony till midnight.--Whereupon, dominoes.
     "Monday--Morning, dominoes.  Afternoon, dominoes.  Evening,     promenading the decks.  Afterward, charades and a lecture from Dr.     C. Dominoes.
     "No date--Anchored off the picturesque city of Cagliari, Sardinia.     Staid till midnight, but not permitted to land by these infamous     foreigners.  They smell inodorously--they do not wash--they dare not     risk cholera.
     "Thursday--Anchored off the beautiful cathedral city of Malaga,     Spain.--Went ashore in the captain's boat--not ashore, either, for     they would not let us land.  Quarantine.  Shipped my newspaper     correspondence, which they took with tongs, dipped it in sea water,     clipped it full of holes, and then fumigated it with villainous     vapors till it smelt like a Spaniard.  Inquired about chances to run     to blockade and visit the Alhambra at Granada.  Too risky--they     might hang a body.  Set sail--middle of afternoon.
     "And so on, and so on, and so forth, for several days.  Finally,     anchored off Gibraltar, which looks familiar and home-like."
It reminds me of the journal I opened with the New Year, once, when I wasa boy and a confiding and a willing prey to those impossible schemes ofreform which well-meaning old maids and grandmothers set for the feet ofunwary youths at that season of the year--setting oversized tasks forthem, which, necessarily failing, as infallibly weaken the boy's strengthof will, diminish his confidence in himself and injure his chances ofsuccess in life.  Please accept of an extract:
     "Monday--Got up, washed, went to bed.     "Tuesday--Got up, washed, went to bed.     "Wednesday--Got up, washed, went to bed.     "Thursday--Got up, washed, went to bed.     "Friday--Got up, washed, went to bed.     "Next Friday--Got up, washed, went to bed.     "Friday fortnight--Got up, washed, went to bed.     "Following month--Got up, washed, went to bed."
I stopped, then, discouraged.  Startling events appeared to be too rare,in my career, to render a diary necessary.  I still reflect with pride,however, that even at that early age I washed when I got up.  Thatjournal finished me.  I never have had the nerve to keep one since.  Myloss of confidence in myself in that line was permanent.
The ship had to stay a week or more at Gibraltar to take in coal for thehome voyage.
It would be very tiresome staying here, and so four of us ran thequarantine blockade and spent seven delightful days in Seville, Cordova,Cadiz, and wandering through the pleasant rural scenery of Andalusia, thegarden of Old Spain.  The experiences of that cheery week were too variedand numerous for a short chapter and I have not room for a long one.Therefore I shall leave them all out.
