  Too far away, oh love, I know,	To save me from this haunted road,	Whose lofty roses break and blow	On a night-sky bent with a load	 Of lights: each solitary rose, Each arc-lamp golden does expose	Ghost beyond ghost of a blossom, shows	Night blenched with a thousand snows.	 Of hawthorn and of lilac trees,	White lilac; shows discoloured night Dripping with all the golden lees	Laburnum gives back to light.	 And shows the red of hawthorn set	On high to the purple heaven of night,	Like flags in blenched blood newly wet, Blood shed in the noiseless fight.	 Of life for love and love for life,	Of hunger for a little food,	Of kissing, lost for want of a wife	Long ago, long ago wooed.
Too far away you are, my love,	To steady my brain in this phantom show	That passes the nightly road above	And returns again below.	 The enormous cliff of horse-chestnut trees  Has poised on each of its ledges	An erect small girl looking down at me;	White-night-gowned little chits I see,	 And they peep at me over the edges	Of the leaves as though they would leap, should I call  Them down to my arms;	"But, child, you're too small for me, too small	 Your little charms."	 White little sheaves of night-gowned maids,	 Some other will thresh you out! And I see leaning from the shades	A lilac like a lady there, who braids	 Her white mantilla about	Her face, and forward leans to catch the sight	 Of a man's face, Gracefully sighing through the white	 Flowery mantilla of lace.	 And another lilac in purple veiled	 Discreetly, all recklessly calls	In a low, shocking perfume, to know who has hailed Her forth from the night: my strength has failed	 In her voice, my weak heart falls:	Oh, and see the laburnum shimmering	 Her draperies down,	As if she would slip the gold, and glimmering  White, stand naked of gown.
The pageant of flowery trees above	 The street pale-passionate goes,	And back again down the pavement, Love	 In a lesser pageant flows.  Two and two are the folk that walk,	 They pass in a half embrace	Of linked bodies, and they talk	 With dark face leaning to face.	 Come then, my love, come as you will  Along this haunted road,	Be whom you will, my darling, I shall	 Keep with you the troth I trowed.
