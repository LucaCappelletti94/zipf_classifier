Nearly one year has flown since this notable pilgrimage was ended; and asI sit here at home in San Francisco thinking, I am moved to confess thatday by day the mass of my memories of the excursion have grown more andmore pleasant as the disagreeable incidents of travel which encumberedthem flitted one by one out of my mind--and now, if the Quaker City wereweighing her anchor to sail away on the very same cruise again, nothingcould gratify me more than to be a passenger. With the same captain andeven the same pilgrims, the same sinners. I was on excellent terms witheight or nine of the excursionists (they are my staunch friends yet,) andwas even on speaking terms with the rest of the sixty-five. I have beenat sea quite enough to know that that was a very good average. Because along sea-voyage not only brings out all the mean traits one has, andexaggerates them, but raises up others which he never suspected hepossessed, and even creates new ones. A twelve months' voyage at seawould make of an ordinary man a very miracle of meanness. On the otherhand, if a man has good qualities, the spirit seldom moves him to exhibitthem on shipboard, at least with any sort of emphasis. Now I amsatisfied that our pilgrims are pleasant old people on shore; I am alsosatisfied that at sea on a second voyage they would be pleasanter,somewhat, than they were on our grand excursion, and so I say withouthesitation that I would be glad enough to sail with them again. I couldat least enjoy life with my handful of old friends. They could enjoylife with their cliques as well--passengers invariably divide up intocliques, on all ships.
And I will say, here, that I would rather travel with an excursion partyof Methuselahs than have to be changing ships and comrades constantly, aspeople do who travel in the ordinary way. Those latter are alwaysgrieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and over othercomrades whom diverging routes have separated from them. They learn tolove a ship just in time to change it for another, and they becomeattached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him. They havethat most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among strangepeople who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the customarybullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants,repeated over and over again within the compass of every month. Theyhave also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunks--of runningthe distressing gauntlet of custom-houses--of the anxieties attendantupon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety.I had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so.We never packed our trunks but twice--when we sailed from New York, andwhen we returned to it. Whenever we made a land journey, we estimatedhow many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we shouldneed, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a valise or twoaccordingly, and left the trunks on board. We chose our comrades fromamong our old, tried friends, and started. We were never dependent uponstrangers for companionship. We often had occasion to pity Americanswhom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends toexchange pains and pleasures with. Whenever we were coming back from aland journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance first--the ship--and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag apeak, we felt as areturning wanderer feels when he sees his home. When we stepped onboard, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end--for the ship washome to us. We always had the same familiar old state-room to go to, andfeel safe and at peace and comfortable again.
I have no fault to find with the manner in which our excursion wasconducted. Its programme was faithfully carried out--a thing whichsurprised me, for great enterprises usually promise vastly more than theyperform. It would be well if such an excursion could be gotten up everyyear and the system regularly inaugurated. Travel is fatal to prejudice,bigotry and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely onthese accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one'slifetime.
The Excursion is ended, and has passed to its place among the things thatwere. But its varied scenes and its manifold incidents will lingerpleasantly in our memories for many a year to come. Always on the wing,as we were, and merely pausing a moment to catch fitful glimpses of thewonders of half a world, we could not hope to receive or retain vividimpressions of all it was our fortune to see. Yet our holyday flight hasnot been in vain--for above the confusion of vague recollections, certainof its best prized pictures lift themselves and will still continueperfect in tint and outline after their surroundings shall have fadedaway.
We shall remember something of pleasant France; and something also ofParis, though it flashed upon us a splendid meteor, and was gone again,we hardly knew how or where. We shall remember, always, how we sawmajestic Gibraltar glorified with the rich coloring of a Spanish sunsetand swimming in a sea of rainbows. In fancy we shall see Milan again,and her stately Cathedral with its marble wilderness of graceful spires.And Padua--Verona--Como, jeweled with stars; and patrician Venice, afloaton her stagnant flood--silent, desolate, haughty--scornful of her humbledstate--wrapping herself in memories of her lost fleets, of battle andtriumph, and all the pageantry of a glory that is departed.
We can not forget Florence--Naples--nor the foretaste of heaven that isin the delicious atmosphere of Greece--and surely not Athens and thebroken temples of the Acropolis. Surely not venerable Rome--nor thegreen plain that compasses her round about, contrasting its brightnesswith her gray decay--nor the ruined arches that stand apart in the plainand clothe their looped and windowed raggedness with vines. We shallremember St. Peter's: not as one sees it when he walks the streets ofRome and fancies all her domes are just alike, but as he sees it leaguesaway, when every meaner edifice has faded out of sight and that one domelooms superbly up in the flush of sunset, full of dignity and grace,strongly outlined as a mountain.
We shall remember Constantinople and the Bosporus--the colossalmagnificence of Baalbec--the Pyramids of Egypt--the prodigious form, thebenignant countenance of the Sphynx--Oriental Smyrna--sacred Jerusalem--Damascus, the "Pearl of the East," the pride of Syria, the fabled Gardenof Eden, the home of princes and genii of the Arabian Nights, the oldestmetropolis on earth, the one city in all the world that has kept its nameand held its place and looked serenely on while the Kingdoms and Empiresof four thousand years have risen to life, enjoyed their little season ofpride and pomp, and then vanished and been forgotten!
