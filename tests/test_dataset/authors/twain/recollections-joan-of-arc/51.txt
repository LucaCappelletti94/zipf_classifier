Joan Sold to the English
MY WOUND gave me a great deal of trouble clear into the first part ofOctober; then the fresher weather renewed my life and strength. All thistime there were reports drifting about that the King was going to ransomJoan. I believed these, for I was young and had not yet found out thelittleness and meanness of our poor human race, which brags about itselfso much, and thinks it is better and higher than the other animals.
In October I was well enough to go out with two sorties, and in thesecond one, on the 23d, I was wounded again. My luck had turned, you see.On the night of the 25th the besiegers decamped, and in the disorder andconfusion one of their prisoners escaped and got safe into Compiegne, andhobble into my room as pallid and pathetic an object as you would wish tosee.
"What? Alive? Noel Rainguesson!"
It was indeed he. It was a most joyful meeting, that you will easilyknow; and also as sad as it was joyful. We could not speak Joan's name.One's voice would have broken down. We knew who was meant when she wasmentioned; we could say "she" and "her," but we could not speak the name.
We talked of the personal staff. Old D'Aulon, wounded and a prisoner, wasstill with Joan and serving her, by permission of the Duke of Burgundy.Joan was being treated with respect due to her rank and to her characteras a prisoner of war taken in honorable conflict. And this wascontinued--as we learned later--until she fell into the hands of thatbastard of Satan, Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais.
Noel was full of noble and affectionate praises and appreciations of ourold boastful big Standard-Bearer, now gone silent forever, his real andimaginary battles all fought, his work done, his life honorably closedand completed.
"And think of his luck!" burst out Noel, with his eyes full of tears."Always the pet child of luck!
"See how it followed him and stayed by him, from his first step allthrough, in the field or out of it; always a splendid figure in thepublic eye, courted and envied everywhere; always having a chance to dofine things and always doing them; in the beginning called the Paladin injoke, and called it afterward in earnest because he magnificently madethe title good; and at last--supremest luck of all--died in the field!died with his harness on; died faithful to his charge the Standard in hishand; died--oh, think of it--with the approving eye of Joan of Arc uponhim!
"He drained the cup of glory to the last drop, and went jubilant to hispeace, blessedly spared all part in the disaster which was to follow.What luck, what luck! And we? What was our sin that we are still here, wewho have also earned our place with the happy dead?"
And presently he said:
"They tore the sacred Standard from his dead hand and carried it away,their most precious prize after its captured owner. But they haven't itnow. A month ago we put our lives upon the risk--our two good knights, myfellow-prisoners, and I--and stole it, and got it smuggled by trustyhands to Orleans, and there it is now, safe for all time in theTreasury."
I was glad and grateful to learn that. I have seen it often since, when Ihave gone to Orleans on the 8th of May to be the petted old guest of thecity and hold the first place of honor at the banquets and in theprocessions--I mean since Joan's brothers passed from this life. It willstill be there, sacredly guarded by French love, a thousand years fromnow--yes, as long as any shred of it hangs together. [1] Two or threeweeks after this talk came the tremendous news like a thunder-clap, andwe were aghast--Joan of Arc sold to the English!
Not for a moment had we ever dreamed of such a thing. We were young, yousee, and did not know the human race, as I have said before. We had beenso proud of our country, so sure of her nobleness, her magnanimity, hergratitude. We had expected little of the King, but of France we hadexpected everything. Everybody knew that in various towns patriot priestshad been marching in procession urging the people to sacrifice money,property, everything, and buy the freedom of their heaven-sent deliverer.That the money would be raised we had not thought of doubting.
But it was all over now, all over. It was a bitter time for us. Theheavens seemed hung with black; all cheer went out from our hearts. Wasthis comrade here at my bedside really Noel Rainguesson, thatlight-hearted creature whose whole life was but one long joke, and whoused up more breath in laughter than in keeping his body alive? No, no;that Noel I was to see no more. This one's heart was broken. He movedgrieving about, and absently, like one in a dream; the stream of hislaughter was dried at its source.
Well, that was best. It was my own mood. We were company for each other.He nursed me patiently through the dull long weeks, and at last, inJanuary, I was strong enough to go about again. Then he said:
"Shall we go now?"
"Yes."
There was no need to explain. Our hearts were in Rouen; we would carryour bodies there. All that we cared for in this life was shut up in thatfortress. We could not help her, but it would be some solace to us to benear her, to breathe the air that she breathed, and look daily upon thestone walls that hid her. What if we should be made prisoners there?Well, we could but do our best, and let luck and fate decide what shouldhappen.
And so we started. We could not realize the change which had come uponthe country. We seemed able to choose our own route and go whenever wepleased, unchallenged and unmolested. When Joan of Arc was in the fieldthere was a sort of panic of fear everywhere; but now that she was out ofthe way, fear had vanished. Nobody was troubled about you or afraid ofyou, nobody was curious about you or your business, everybody wasindifferent.
We presently saw that we could take to the Seine, and not weary ourselvesout with land travel.
So we did it, and were carried in a boat to within a league of Rouen.Then we got ashore; not on the hilly side, but on the other, where it isas level as a floor. Nobody could enter or leave the city withoutexplaining himself. It was because they feared attempts at a rescue ofJoan.
We had no trouble. We stopped in the plain with a family of peasants andstayed a week, helping them with their work for board and lodging, andmaking friends of them. We got clothes like theirs, and wore them. Whenwe had worked our way through their reserves and gotten their confidence,we found that they secretly harbored French hearts in their bodies. Thenwe came out frankly and told them everything, and found them ready to doanything they could to help us.
Our plan was soon made, and was quite simple. It was to help them drive aflock of sheep to the market of the city. One morning early we made theventure in a melancholy drizzle of rain, and passed through the frowninggates unmolested. Our friends had friends living over a humble wine shopin a quaint tall building situated in one of the narrow lanes that rundown from the cathedral to the river, and with these they bestowed us;and the next day they smuggled our own proper clothing and otherbelongings to us. The family that lodged us--the Pieroons--were French insympathy, and we needed to have no secrets from them.
[1] It remained there three hundred and sixty years, and then wasdestroyed in a public bonfire, together with two swords, a plumed cap,several suits of state apparel, and other relics of the Maid, by a mob inthe time of the Revolution. Nothing which the hand of Joan of Arc isknown to have touched now remains in existence except a few preciouslyguarded military and state papers which she signed, her pen being guidedby a clerk or her secretary, Louis de Conte. A boulder exists from whichshe is known to have mounted her horse when she was once setting out upona campaign. Up to a quarter of a century ago there was a single hair fromher head still in existence. It was drawn through the wax of a sealattached to the parchment of a state document. It was surreptitiouslysnipped out, seal and all, by some vandal relic-hunter, and carried off.Doubtless it still exists, but only the thief knows where. -- TRANSLATOR.
