SCENE
The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton. Door at back leading on toterrace.
[LORD ILLINGWORTH and GERALD, R.C. LORD ILLINGWORTH lolling on asofa. GERALD in a chair.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.I knew she would come round in the end.
GERALD. My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, andI know she doesn't think I am educated enough to be your secretary.She is perfectly right, too. I was fearfully idle when I was atschool, and I couldn't pass an examination now to save my life.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear Gerald, examinations are of no valuewhatsoever. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and ifhe is not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.
GERALD. But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Don't be afraid, Gerald. Remember that you'vegot on your side the most wonderful thing in the world - youth!There is nothing like youth. The middle-aged are mortgaged toLife. The old are in life's lumber-room. But youth is the Lord ofLife. Youth has a kingdom waiting for it. Every one is born aking, and most people die in exile, like most kings. To win backmy youth, Gerald, there is nothing I wouldn't do - except takeexercise, get up early, or be a useful member of the community.
GERALD. But you don't call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.
GERALD. I don't remember my father; he died years ago.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. So Lady Hunstanton told me.
GERALD. It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about myfather. I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Winces slightly.] Really? [Goes over and putshis hand on GERALD'S shoulder.] You have missed not having afather, I suppose, Gerald?
GERALD. Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me. No one ever hadsuch a mother as I have had.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I am quite sure of that. Still I should imaginethat most mothers don't quite understand their sons. Don'trealise, I mean, that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, tomake himself a name. After all, Gerald, you couldn't be expectedto pass all your life in such a hole as Wrockley, could you?
GERALD. Oh, no! It would be dreadful!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. A mother's love is very touching, of course, butit is often curiously selfish. I mean, there is a good deal ofselfishness in it.
GERALD. [Slowly.] I suppose there is.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Your mother is a thoroughly good woman. Butgood women have such limited views of life, their horizon is sosmall, their interests are so petty, aren't they?
GERALD. They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don'tcare much about.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I suppose your mother is very religious, andthat sort of thing.
GERALD. Oh, yes, she's always going to church.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is theonly thing worth being nowadays. You want to be modern, don't you,Gerald? You want to know life as it really is. Not to be put ofwith any old-fashioned theories about life. Well, what you have todo at present is simply to fit yourself for the best society. Aman who can dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the world.The future belongs to the dandy. It is the exquisites who aregoing to rule.
GERALD. I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I havealways been told that a man should not think too much about hisclothes.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. People nowadays are so absolutely superficialthat they don't understand the philosophy of the superficial. Bythe way, Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better.Sentiment is all very well for the button-hole. But the essentialthing for a necktie is style. A well-tied tie is the first seriousstep in life.
GERALD. [Laughing.] I might be able to learn how to tie a tie,Lord Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do. Idon't know how to talk.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh! talk to every woman as if you loved her, andto every man as if he bored you, and at the end of your firstseason you will have the reputation of possessing the most perfectsocial tact.
GERALD. But it is very difficult to get into society isn't it?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. To get into the best society, nowadays, one haseither to feed people, amuse people, or shock people - that is all!
GERALD. I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out ofit simply a tragedy. Society is a necessary thing. No man has anyreal success in this world unless he has got women to back him, andwomen rule society. If you have not got women on your side you arequite over. You might just as well be a barrister, or astockbroker, or a journalist at once.
GERALD. It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You should never try to understand them. Womenare pictures. Men are problems. If you want to know what a womanreally means - which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do- look at her, don't listen to her.
GERALD. But women are awfully clever, aren't they?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should always tell them so. But, to thephilosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matterover mind - just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
GERALD. How then can women have so much power as you say theyhave?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. The history of women is the history of the worstform of tyranny the world has ever known. The tyranny of the weakover the strong. It is the only tyranny that lasts.
GERALD. But haven't women got a refining influence?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Nothing refines but the intellect.
GERALD. Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren'tthere?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Only two kinds in society: the plain and thecoloured.
GERALD. But there are good women in society, aren't there?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Far too many.
GERALD. But do you think women shouldn't be good?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should never tell them so, they'd all becomegood at once. Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex. Every womanis a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself.
GERALD. You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Men marry because they are tired; women becausethey are curious. Both are disappointed.
GERALD. But don't you think one can be happy when one is married?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Perfectly happy. But the happiness of a marriedman, my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.
GERALD. But if one is in love?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should always be in love. That is thereason one should never marry.
GERALD. Love is a very wonderful thing, isn't it?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. When one is in love one begins by deceivingoneself. And one ends by deceiving others. That is what the worldcalls a romance. But a really GRANDE PASSION is comparatively rarenowadays. It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.That is the one use of the idle classes in a country, and the onlypossible explanation of us Harfords.
GERALD. Harfords, Lord Illingworth?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. That is my family name. You should study thePeerage, Gerald. It is the one book a young man about town shouldknow thoroughly, and it is the best thing in fiction the Englishhave ever done. And now, Gerald, you are going into a perfectlynew life with me, and I want you to know how to live. [MRS.ARBUTHNOT appears on terrace behind.] For the world has been madeby fools that wise men should live in it!
[Enter L.C. LADY HUNSTANTON and DR. DAUBENY.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! here you are, dear Lord Illingworth. Well, Isuppose you have been telling our young friend, Gerald, what hisnew duties are to be, and giving him a great deal of good adviceover a pleasant cigarette.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I have been giving him the best of advice, LadyHunstanton, and the best of cigarettes.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you,but I suppose I am too old now to learn. Except from you, dearArchdeacon, when you are in your nice pulpit. But then I alwaysknow what you are going to say, so I don't feel alarmed. [SeesMRS. ARBUTHNOT.] Ah! dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come and join us.Come, dear. [Enter MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] Gerald has been having such along talk with Lord Illingworth; I am sure you must feel very muchflattered at the pleasant way in which everything has turned outfor him. Let us sit down. [They sit down.] And how is yourbeautiful embroidery going on?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I am always at work, Lady Hunstanton.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn'tshe?
THE ARCHDEACON. She was very deft with her needle once, quite aDorcas. But the gout has crippled her fingers a good deal. Shehas not touched the tambour frame for nine or ten years. But shehas many other amusements. She is very much interested in her ownhealth.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! that is always a nice distraction, in it not?Now, what are you talking about, Lord Illingworth? Do tell us.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I was on the point of explaining to Gerald thatthe world has always laughed at its own tragedies, that being theonly way in which it has been able to bear them. And that,consequently, whatever the world has treated seriously belongs tothe comedy side of things.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Now I am quite out of my depth. I usually amwhen Lord Illingworth says anything. And the Humane Society ismost careless. They never rescue me. I am left to sink. I have adim idea, dear Lord Illingworth, that you are always on the side ofthe sinners, and I know I always try to be on the side of thesaints, but that is as far as I get. And after all, it may bemerely the fancy of a drowning person.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. The only difference between the saint and thesinner is that every saint has a past, and every sinner has afuture.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! that quite does for me. I haven't a word tosay. You and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are behind the age. We can'tfollow Lord Illingworth. Too much care was taken with oureducation, I am afraid. To have been well brought up is a greatdrawback nowadays. It shuts one out from so much.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth inany of his opinions.
LADY HUNSTANTON. You are quite right, dear.
[GERALD shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably over at hismother. Enter LADY CAROLINE.]
LADY CAROLINE. Jane, have you seen John anywhere?
LADY HUNSTANTON. You needn't be anxious about him, dear. He iswith Lady Stutfield; I saw them some time ago, in the YellowDrawing-room. They seem quite happy together. You are not going,Caroline? Pray sit down.
LADY CAROLINE. I think I had better look after John.
[Exit LADY CAROLINE.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. It doesn't do to pay men so much attention. AndCaroline has really nothing to be anxious about. Lady Stutfield isvery sympathetic. She is just as sympathetic about one thing asshe is about another. A beautiful nature.
[Enter SIR JOHN and MRS. ALLONBY.]
Ah! here is Sir John! And with Mrs. Allonby too! I suppose it wasMrs. Allonby I saw him with. Sir John, Caroline has been lookingeverywhere for you.
MRS. ALLONBY. We have been waiting for her in the Music-room, dearLady Hunstanton.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! the Music-room, of course. I thought it wasthe Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective. [Tothe ARCHDEACON.] Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn't she?
THE ARCHDEACON. She used to be quite remarkable for her memory,but since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of herearly childhood. But she finds great pleasure in suchretrospections, great pleasure.
[Enter LADY STUTFIELD and MR. KELVIL.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvilbeen talking to you about?
LADY STUTFIELD. About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Bimetallism! Is that quite a nice subject?However, I know people discuss everything very freely nowadays.What did Sir John talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?
MRS. ALLONBY. About Patagonia.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Really? What a remote topic! But veryimproving, I have no doubt.
MRS. ALLONBY. He has been most interesting on the subject ofPatagonia. Savages seem to have quite the same views as culturedpeople on almost all subjects. They are excessively advanced.
LADY HUNSTANTON. What do they do?
MRS. ALLONBY. Apparently everything.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, isit not, to find that Human Nature is permanently one. - On thewhole, the world is the same world, is it not?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. The world is simply divided into two classes -those who believe the incredible, like the public - and those whodo the improbable -
MRS. ALLONBY. Like yourself?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Yes; I am always astonishing myself. It is theonly thing that makes life worth living.
LADY STUTFIELD. And what have you been doing lately thatastonishes you?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I have been discovering all kinds of beautifulqualities in my own nature.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah! don't become quite perfect all at once. Do itgradually!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I don't intend to grow perfect at all. Atleast, I hope I shan't. It would be most inconvenient. Women loveus for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgiveus everything, even our gigantic intellects.
MRS. ALLONBY. It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis. Weforgive adoration; that is quite as much as should be expected fromus.
[Enter LORD ALFRED. He joins LADY STUTFIELD.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn'twe, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot? I am sure you agree with me in that.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I do not, Lady Hunstanton. I think there are manythings women should never forgive.
LADY HUNSTANTON. What sort of things?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. The ruin of another woman's life.
[Moves slowly away to back of stage.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but Ibelieve there are admirable homes where people of that kind arelooked after and reformed, and I think on the whole that the secretof life is to take things very, very easily.
MRS. ALLONBY. The secret of life is never to have an emotion thatis unbecoming.
LADY STUTFIELD. The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasureof being terribly, terribly deceived.
KELVIL. The secret of life is to resist temptation, LadyStutfield.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. There is no secret of life. Life's aim, if ithas one, is simply to be always looking for temptations. There arenot nearly enough. I sometimes pass a whole day without comingacross a single one. It is quite dreadful. It makes one sonervous about the future.
LADY HUNSTANTON. [Shakes her fan at him.] I don't know how it is,dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems tome excessively immoral. It has been most interesting, listening toyou.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. All thought is immoral. Its very essence isdestruction. If you think of anything, you kill it. Nothingsurvives being thought of.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I don't understand a word, Lord Illingworth. ButI have no doubt it is all quite true. Personally, I have verylittle to reproach myself with, on the score of thinking. I don'tbelieve in women thinking too much. Women should think inmoderation, as they should do all things in moderation.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.Nothing succeeds like excess.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I hope I shall remember that. It sounds anadmirable maxim. But I'm beginning to forget everything. It's agreat misfortune.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is one of your most fascinating qualities,Lady Hunstanton. No woman should have a memory. Memory in a womanis the beginning of dowdiness. One can always tell from a woman'sbonnet whether she has got a memory or not.
LADY HUNSTANTON. How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth. Youalways find out that one's most glaring fault is one's mostimportant virtue. You have the most comforting views of life.
[Enter FARQUHAR.]
FARQUHAR. Doctor Daubeny's carriage!
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear Archdeacon! It is only half-past ten.
THE ARCHDEACON. [Rising.] I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny's bad nights.
LADY HUNSTANTON. [Rising.] Well, I won't keep you from her.[Goes with him towards door.] I have told Farquhar to put a braceof partridge into the carriage. Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.
THE ARCHDEACON. It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny nevertouches solids now. Lives entirely on jellies. But she iswonderfully cheerful, wonderfully cheerful. She has nothing tocomplain of.
[Exit with LADY HUNSTANTON.]
MRS. ALLONBY. [Goes over to LORD ILLINGWORTH.] There is abeautiful moon to-night.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Let us go and look at it. To look at anythingthat is inconstant is charming nowadays.
MRS. ALLONBY. You have your looking-glass.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is unkind. It merely shows me my wrinkles.
MRS. ALLONBY. Mine is better behaved. It never tells me thetruth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Then it is in love with you.
[Exeunt SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL and LORD ALFRED.]
GERALD. [To LORD ILLINGWORTH] May I come too?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Do, my dear boy. [Moves towards with MRS.ALLONBY and GERALD.]
[LADY CAROLINE enters, looks rapidly round and goes off in oppositedirection to that taken by SIR JOHN and LADY STUTFIELD.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald!
GERALD. What, mother!
[Exit LORD ILLINGWORTH with MRS. ALLONBY.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It is getting late. Let us go home.
GERALD. My dear mother. Do let us wait a little longer. LordIllingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have agreat surprise for you. We are starting for India at the end ofthis month.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Let us go home.
GERALD. If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bidgood-bye to Lord Illingworth first. I'll be back in five minutes.[Exit.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him -not with him! I couldn't bear it. [Walks up and down.]
[Enter HESTER.]
HESTER. What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Is it?
HESTER. Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends. Youare so different from the other women here. When you came into theDrawing-room this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense ofwhat is good and pure in life. I had been foolish. There arethings that are right to say, but that may be said at the wrongtime and to the wrong people.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I heard what you said. I agree with it, MissWorsley.
HESTER. I didn't know you had heard it. But I knew you wouldagree with me. A woman who has sinned should be punished,shouldn't she?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Yes.
HESTER. She shouldn't be allowed to come into the society of goodmen and women?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. She should not.
HESTER. And the man should be punished in the same way?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. In the same way. And the children, if there arechildren, in the same way also?
HESTER. Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should bevisited on the children. It is a just law. It is God's law.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It is one of God's terrible laws.
[Moves away to fireplace.]
HESTER. You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs.Arbuthnot?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Yes.
HESTER. Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth? Ofcourse there is position, no doubt, and money, but position andmoney are not everything, are they?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. They are nothing; they bring misery.
HESTER. Then why do you let your son go with him?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He wishes it himself.
HESTER. But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He has set his heart on going.
HESTER. He couldn't refuse you anything. He loves you too much.Ask him to stay. Let me send him in to you. He is on the terraceat this moment with Lord Illingworth. I heard them laughingtogether as I passed through the Music-room.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Don't trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait. It is ofno consequence.
HESTER. No, I'll tell him you want him. Do - do ask him to stay.[Exit HESTER.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He won't come - I know he won't come.
[Enter LADY CAROLINE. She looks round anxiously. Enter GERALD.]
LADY CAROLINE. Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhereon the terrace?
GERALD. No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.
LADY CAROLINE. It is very curious. It is time for him to retire.
[Exit LADY CAROLINE.]
GERALD. Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting. I forgot allabout it. I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been sohappy.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. At the prospect of going away?
GERALD. Don't put it like that, mother. Of course I am sorry toleave you. Why, you are the best mother in the whole world. Butafter all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live insuch a place as Wrockley. You don't mind it. But I'm ambitions; Iwant something more than that. I want to have a career. I want todo something that will make you proud of me, and Lord Illingworthis going to help me. He is going to do everything for me.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald, don't go away with Lord Illingworth. Iimplore you not to. Gerald, I beg you!
GERALD. Mother, how changeable you are! You don't seem to knowyour own mind for a single moment. An hour and a half ago in theDrawing-room you agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round andmake objections, and try to force me to give up my one chance inlife. Yes, my one chance. You don't suppose that men like LordIllingworth are to be found every day, do you, mother? It is verystrange that when I have had such a wonderful piece of good luck,the one person to put difficulties in my way should be my ownmother. Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester Worsley. Whocould help loving her? I love her more than I have ever told you,far more. And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I could - Icould ask her to - Don't you understand now, mother, what it meansto me to be Lord Illingworth's secretary? To start like that is tofind a career ready for one - before one - waiting for one. If Iwere Lord Illingworth's secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.As a wretched bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be animpertinence.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley. Iknow her views on life. She has just told them to me. [A pause.]
GERALD. Then I have my ambition left, at any rate. That issomething - I am glad I have that! You have always tried to crushmy ambition, mother - haven't you? You have told me that the worldis a wicked place, that success is not worth having, that societyis shallow, and all that sort of thing - well, I don't believe it,mother. I think the world must be delightful. I think societymust be exquisite. I think success is a thing worth having. Youhave been wrong in all that you taught me, mother, quite wrong.Lord Illingworth is a successful man. He is a fashionable man. Heis a man who lives in the world and for it. Well, I would giveanything to be just like Lord Illingworth.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I would sooner see you dead.
GERALD. Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illingworth? Tellme - tell me right out. What is it?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He is a bad man.
GERALD. In what way bad? I don't understand what you mean.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I will tell you.
GERALD. I suppose you think him bad, because he doesn't believethe same things as you do. Well, men are different from women,mother. It is natural that they should have different views.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It is not what Lord Illingworth believes, or whathe does not believe, that makes him bad. It is what he is.
GERALD. Mother, is it something you know of him? Something youactually know?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It is something I know.
GERALD. Something you are quite sure of?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Quite sure of.
GERALD. How long have you known it?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. For twenty years.
GERALD. Is it fair to go back twenty years in any man's career?And what have you or I to do with Lord Illingworth's early life?What business is it of ours?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. What this man has been, he is now, and will bealways.
GERALD. Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did? If he didanything shameful, I will not go away with him. Surely you know mewell enough for that?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald, come near to me. Quite close to me, asyou used to do when you were a little boy, when you were mother'sown boy. [GERALD sits down betide his mother. She runs herfingers through his hair, and strokes his hands.] Gerald, therewas a girl once, she was very young, she was little over eighteenat the time. George Harford - that was Lord Illingworth's namethen - George Harford met her. She knew nothing about life. He -knew everything. He made this girl love him. He made her love himso much that she left her father's house with him one morning. Sheloved him so much, and he had promised to marry her! He hadsolemnly promised to marry her, and she had believed him. She wasvery young, and - and ignorant of what life really is. But he putthe marriage off from week to week, and month to month. - Shetrusted in him all the while. She loved him. - Before her childwas born - for she had a child - she implored him for the child'ssake to marry her, that the child might have a name, that her sinmight not be visited on the child, who was innocent. He refused.After the child was born she left him, taking the child away, andher life was ruined, and her soul ruined, and all that was sweet,and good, and pure in her ruined also. She suffered terribly - shesuffers now. She will always suffer. For her there is no joy, nopeace, no atonement. She is a woman who drags a chain like aguilty thing. She is a woman who wears a mask, like a thing thatis a leper. The fire cannot purify her. The waters cannot quenchher anguish. Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her sleep!no poppies forgetfulness! She is lost! She is a lost soul! - Thatis why I call Lord Illingworth a bad man. That is why I don't wantmy boy to be with him.
GERALD. My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of course. ButI dare say the girl was just as much to blame as Lord Illingworthwas. - After all, would a really nice girl, a girl with any nicefeelings at all, go away from her home with a man to whom she wasnot married, and live with him as his wife? No nice girl would.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [After a pause.] Gerald, I withdraw all myobjections. You are at liberty to go away with Lord Illingworth,when and where you choose.
GERALD. Dear mother, I knew you wouldn't stand in my way. You arethe best woman God ever made. And, as for Lord Illingworth, Idon't believe he is capable of anything infamous or base. I can'tbelieve it of him - I can't.
HESTER. [Outside.] Let me go! Let me go! [Enter HESTER interror, and rushes over to GERALD and flings herself in his arms.]
HESTER. Oh! save me - save me from him!
GERALD. From whom?
HESTER. He has insulted me! Horribly insulted me! Save me!
GERALD. Who? Who has dared - ?
[LORD ILLINGWORTH enters at back of stage. HESTER breaks fromGERALD'S arms and points to him.]
GERALD [He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation.]Lord Illingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God'searth, a thing as pure as my own mother. You have insulted thewoman I love most in the world with my own mother. As there is aGod in Heaven, I will kill you!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [Rushing across and catching hold of him] No! no!
GERALD. [Thrusting her back.] Don't hold me, mother. Don't holdme - I'll kill him!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald!
GERALD. Let me go, I say!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Stop, Gerald, stop! He is your own father!
[GERALD clutches his mother's hands and looks into her face. Shesinks slowly on the ground in shame. HESTER steals towards thedoor. LORD ILLINGWORTH frowns and bites his lip. After a timeGERALD raises his mother up, puts his am round her, and leads herfrom the room.]
