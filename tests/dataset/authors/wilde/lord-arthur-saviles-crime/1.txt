It was Lady Windermere's last reception before Easter, and BentinckHouse was even more crowded than usual. Six Cabinet Ministers hadcome on from the Speaker's Levee in their stars and ribands, all thepretty women wore their smartest dresses, and at the end of thepicture-gallery stood the Princess Sophia of Carlsruhe, a heavyTartar-looking lady, with tiny black eyes and wonderful emeralds,talking bad French at the top of her voice, and laughingimmoderately at everything that was said to her. It was certainly awonderful medley of people. Gorgeous peeresses chatted affably toviolent Radicals, popular preachers brushed coat-tails with eminentsceptics, a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout prima-donna from room to room, on the staircase stood several RoyalAcademicians, disguised as artists, and it was said that at one timethe supper-room was absolutely crammed with geniuses. In fact, itwas one of Lady Windermere's best nights, and the Princess stayedtill nearly half-past eleven.
As soon as she had gone, Lady Windermere returned to the picture-gallery, where a celebrated political economist was solemnlyexplaining the scientific theory of music to an indignant virtuosofrom Hungary, and began to talk to the Duchess of Paisley. Shelooked wonderfully beautiful with her grand ivory throat, her largeblue forget-me-not eyes, and her heavy coils of golden hair. Or purthey were--not that pale straw colour that nowadays usurps thegracious name of gold, but such gold as is woven into sunbeams orhidden in strange amber; and they gave to her face something of theframe of a saint, with not a little of the fascination of a sinner.She was a curious psychological study. Early in life she haddiscovered the important truth that nothing looks so like innocenceas an indiscretion; and by a series of reckless escapades, half ofthem quite harmless, she had acquired all the privileges of apersonality. She had more than once changed her husband; indeed,Debrett credits her with three marriages; but as she had neverchanged her lover, the world had long ago ceased to talk scandalabout her. She was now forty years of age, childless, and with thatinordinate passion for pleasure which is the secret of remainingyoung.
Suddenly she looked eagerly round the room, and said, in her clearcontralto voice, 'Where is my cheiromantist?'
'Your what, Gladys?' exclaimed the Duchess, giving an involuntarystart.
'My cheiromantist, Duchess; I can't live without him at present.'
'Dear Gladys! you are always so original,' murmured the Duchess,trying to remember what a cheiromantist really was, and hoping itwas not the same as a cheiropodist.
'He comes to see my hand twice a week regularly,' continued LadyWindermere, 'and is most interesting about it.'
'Good heavens!' said the Duchess to herself, 'he is a sort ofcheiropodist after all. How very dreadful. I hope he is aforeigner at any rate. It wouldn't be quite so bad then.'
'I must certainly introduce him to you.'
'Introduce him!' cried the Duchess; 'you don't mean to say he ishere?' and she began looking about for a small tortoise-shell fanand a very tattered lace shawl, so as to be ready to go at amoment's notice.
'Of course he is here; I would not dream of giving a party withouthim. He tells me I have a pure psychic hand, and that if my thumbhad been the least little bit shorter, I should have been aconfirmed pessimist, and gone into a convent.'
'Oh, I see!' said the Duchess, feeling very much relieved; 'he tellsfortunes, I suppose?'
'And misfortunes, too,' answered Lady Windermere, 'any amount ofthem. Next year, for instance, I am in great danger, both by landand sea, so I am going to live in a balloon, and draw up my dinnerin a basket every evening. It is all written down on my littlefinger, or on the palm of my hand, I forget which.'
'But surely that is tempting Providence, Gladys.'
'My dear Duchess, surely Providence can resist temptation by thistime. I think every one should have their hands told once a month,so as to know what not to do. Of course, one does it all the same,but it is so pleasant to be warned. Now if some one doesn't go andfetch Mr. Podgers at once, I shall have to go myself.'
'Let me go, Lady Windermere,' said a tall handsome young man, whowas standing by, listening to the conversation with an amused smile.
'Thanks so much, Lord Arthur; but I am afraid you wouldn't recognisehim.'
'If he is as wonderful as you say, Lady Windermere, I couldn't wellmiss him. Tell me what he is like, and I'll bring him to you atonce.'
'Well, he is not a bit like a cheiromantist. I mean he is notmysterious, or esoteric, or romantic-looking. He is a little, stoutman, with a funny, bald head, and great gold-rimmed spectacles;something between a family doctor and a country attorney. I'mreally very sorry, but it is not my fault. People are so annoying.All my pianists look exactly like poets, and all my poets lookexactly like pianists; and I remember last season asking a mostdreadful conspirator to dinner, a man who had blown up ever so manypeople, and always wore a coat of mail, and carried a dagger up hisshirt-sleeve; and do you know that when he came he looked just likea nice old clergyman, and cracked jokes all the evening? Of course,he was very amusing, and all that, but I was awfully disappointed;and when I asked him about the coat of mail, he only laughed, andsaid it was far too cold to wear in England. Ah, here is Mr.Podgers! Now, Mr. Podgers, I want you to tell the Duchess ofPaisley's hand. Duchess, you must take your glove off. No, not theleft hand, the other.'
'Dear Gladys, I really don't think it is quite right,' said theDuchess, feebly unbuttoning a rather soiled kid glove.
'Nothing interesting ever is,' said Lady Windermere: 'on a fait lemonde ainsi. But I must introduce you. Duchess, this is Mr.Podgers, my pet cheiromantist. Mr. Podgers, this is the Duchess ofPaisley, and if you say that she has a larger mountain of the moonthan I have, I will never believe in you again.'
'I am sure, Gladys, there is nothing of the kind in my hand,' saidthe Duchess gravely.
'Your Grace is quite right,' said Mr. Podgers, glancing at thelittle fat hand with its short square fingers, 'the mountain of themoon is not developed. The line of life, however, is excellent.Kindly bend the wrist. Thank you. Three distinct lines on therascette! You will live to a great age, Duchess, and be extremelyhappy. Ambition--very moderate, line of intellect not exaggerated,line of heart--'
'Now, do be indiscreet, Mr. Podgers,' cried Lady Windermere.
'Nothing would give me greater pleasure,' said Mr. Podgers, bowing,'if the Duchess ever had been, but I am sorry to say that I seegreat permanence of affection, combined with a strong sense ofduty.'
'Pray go on, Mr. Podgers,' said the Duchess, looking quite pleased.
'Economy is not the least of your Grace's virtues,' continued Mr.Podgers, and Lady Windermere went off into fits of laughter.
'Economy is a very good thing,' remarked the Duchess complacently;'when I married Paisley he had eleven castles, and not a singlehouse fit to live in.'
'And now he has twelve houses, and not a single castle,' cried LadyWindermere.
'Well, my dear,' said the Duchess, 'I like--'
'Comfort,' said Mr. Podgers, 'and modern improvements, and hot waterlaid on in every bedroom. Your Grace is quite right. Comfort isthe only thing our civilisation can give us.
'You have told the Duchess's character admirably, Mr. Podgers, andnow you must tell Lady Flora's'; and in answer to a nod from thesmiling hostess, a tall girl, with sandy Scotch hair, and highshoulder-blades, stepped awkwardly from behind the sofa, and heldout a long, bony hand with spatulate fingers.
'Ah, a pianist! I see,' said Mr. Podgers, 'an excellent pianist, butperhaps hardly a musician. Very reserved, very honest, and with agreat love of animals.'
'Quite true!' exclaimed the Duchess, turning to Lady Windermere,'absolutely true! Flora keeps two dozen collie dogs at Macloskie,and would turn our town house into a menagerie if her father wouldlet her.'
'Well, that is just what I do with my house every Thursday evening,'cried Lady Windermere, laughing, 'only I like lions better thancollie dogs.'
'Your one mistake, Lady Windermere,' said Mr. Podgers, with apompous bow.
'If a woman can't make her mistakes charming, she is only a female,'was the answer. 'But you must read some more hands for us. Come,Sir Thomas, show Mr. Podgers yours'; and a genial-looking oldgentleman, in a white waistcoat, came forward, and held out a thickrugged hand, with a very long third finger.
'An adventurous nature; four long voyages in the past, and one tocome. Been ship-wrecked three times. No, only twice, but in dangerof a shipwreck your next journey. A strong Conservative, verypunctual, and with a passion for collecting curiosities. Had asevere illness between the ages sixteen and eighteen. Was left afortune when about thirty. Great aversion to cats and Radicals.'
'Extraordinary!' exclaimed Sir Thomas; 'you must really tell mywife's hand, too.'
'Your second wife's,' said Mr. Podgers quietly, still keeping SirThomas's hand in his. 'Your second wife's. I shall be charmed';but Lady Marvel, a melancholy-looking woman, with brown hair andsentimental eyelashes, entirely declined to have her past or herfuture exposed; and nothing that Lady Windermere could do wouldinduce Monsieur de Koloff, the Russian Ambassador, even to take hisgloves off. In fact, many people seemed afraid to face the oddlittle man with his stereotyped smile, his gold spectacles, and hisbright, beady eyes; and when he told poor Lady Fermor, right outbefore every one, that she did not care a bit for music, but wasextremely fond of musicians, it was generally felt that cheiromancywas a most dangerous science, and one that ought not to beencouraged, except in a tete-a-tete.
Lord Arthur Savile, however, who did not know anything about LadyFermor's unfortunate story, and who had been watching Mr. Podgerswith a great deal of interest, was filled with an immense curiosityto have his own hand read, and feeling somewhat shy about puttinghimself forward, crossed over the room to where Lady Windermere wassitting, and, with a charming blush, asked her if she thought Mr.Podgers would mind.
'Of course, he won't mind,' said Lady Windermere, 'that is what heis here for. All my lions, Lord Arthur, are performing lions, andjump through hoops whenever I ask them. But I must warn youbeforehand that I shall tell Sybil everything. She is coming tolunch with me to-morrow, to talk about bonnets, and if Mr. Podgersfinds out that you have a bad temper, or a tendency to gout, or awife living in Bayswater, I shall certainly let her know all aboutit.'
Lord Arthur smiled, and shook his head. 'I am not afraid,' heanswered. 'Sybil knows me as well as I know her.'
'Ah! I am a little sorry to hear you say that. The proper basisfor marriage is a mutual misunderstanding. No, I am not at allcynical, I have merely got experience, which, however, is very muchthe same thing. Mr. Podgers, Lord Arthur Savile is dying to havehis hand read. Don't tell him that he is engaged to one of the mostbeautiful girls in London, because that appeared in the Morning Posta month ago.
'Dear Lady Windermere,' cried the Marchioness of Jedburgh, 'do letMr. Podgers stay here a little longer. He has just told me I shouldgo on the stage, and I am so interested.'
'If he has told you that, Lady Jedburgh, I shall certainly take himaway. Come over at once, Mr. Podgers, and read Lord Arthur's hand.'
'Well,' said Lady Jedburgh, making a little moue as she rose fromthe sofa, 'if I am not to be allowed to go on the stage, I must beallowed to be part of the audience at any rate.'
'Of course; we are all going to be part of the audience,' said LadyWindermere; 'and now, Mr. Podgers, be sure and tell us somethingnice. Lord Arthur is one of my special favourites.'
But when Mr. Podgers saw Lord Arthur's hand he grew curiously pale,and said nothing. A shudder seemed to pass through him, and hisgreat bushy eyebrows twitched convulsively, in an odd, irritatingway they had when he was puzzled. Then some huge beads ofperspiration broke out on his yellow forehead, like a poisonous dew,and his fat fingers grew cold and clammy.
Lord Arthur did not fail to notice these strange signs of agitation,and, for the first time in his life, he himself felt fear. Hisimpulse was to rush from the room, but he restrained himself. Itwas better to know the worst, whatever it was, than to be left inthis hideous uncertainty.
'I am waiting, Mr. Podgers,' he said.
'We are all waiting,' cried Lady Windermere, in her quick, impatientmanner, but the cheiromantist made no reply.
'I believe Arthur is going on the stage,' said Lady Jedburgh, 'andthat, after your scolding, Mr. Podgers is afraid to tell him so.'
Suddenly Mr. Podgers dropped Lord Arthur's right hand, and seizedhold of his left, bending down so low to examine it that the goldrims of his spectacles seemed almost to touch the palm. For amoment his face became a white mask of horror, but he soon recoveredhis sang-froid, and looking up at Lady Windermere, said with aforced smile, 'It is the hand of a charming young man.
'Of course it is!' answered Lady Windermere, 'but will he be acharming husband? That is what I want to know.'
'All charming young men are,' said Mr. Podgers.
'I don't think a husband should be too fascinating,' murmured LadyJedburgh pensively, 'it is so dangerous.'
'My dear child, they never are too fascinating,' cried LadyWindermere. 'But what I want are details. Details are the onlythings that interest. What is going to happen to Lord Arthur?'
'Well, within the next few months Lord Arthur will go a voyage--'
'Oh yes, his honeymoon, of course!'
'And lose a relative.'
'Not his sister, I hope?' said Lady Jedburgh, in a piteous tone ofvoice.
'Certainly not his sister,' answered Mr. Podgers, with a deprecatingwave of the hand, 'a distant relative merely.'
'Well, I am dreadfully disappointed,' said Lady Windermere. 'I haveabsolutely nothing to tell Sybil to-morrow. No one cares aboutdistant relatives nowadays. They went out of fashion years ago.However, I suppose she had better have a black silk by her; italways does for church, you know. And now let us go to supper.They are sure to have eaten everything up, but we may find some hotsoup. Francois used to make excellent soup once, but he is soagitated about politics at present, that I never feel quite certainabout him. I do wish General Boulanger would keep quiet. Duchess,I am sure you are tired?'
'Not at all, dear Gladys,' answered the Duchess, waddling towardsthe door. 'I have enjoyed myself immensely, and the cheiropodist, Imean the cheiromantist, is most interesting. Flora, where can mytortoise-shell fan be? Oh, thank you, Sir Thomas, so much. And mylace shawl, Flora? Oh, thank you, Sir Thomas, very kind, I'm sure';and the worthy creature finally managed to get downstairs withoutdropping her scent-bottle more than twice.
All this time Lord Arthur Savile had remained standing by thefireplace, with the same feeling of dread over him, the samesickening sense of coming evil. He smiled sadly at his sister, asshe swept past him on Lord Plymdale's arm, looking lovely in herpink brocade and pearls, and he hardly heard Lady Windermere whenshe called to him to follow her. He thought of Sybil Merton, andthe idea that anything could come between them made his eyes dimwith tears.
Looking at him, one would have said that Nemesis had stolen theshield of Pallas, and shown him the Gorgon's head. He seemed turnedto stone, and his face was like marble in its melancholy. He hadlived the delicate and luxurious life of a young man of birth andfortune, a life exquisite in its freedom from sordid care, itsbeautiful boyish insouciance; and now for the first time he becameconscious of the terrible mystery of Destiny, of the awful meaningof Doom.
How mad and monstrous it all seemed! Could it be that written onhis hand, in characters that he could not read himself, but thatanother could decipher, was some fearful secret of sin, some blood-red sign of crime? Was there no escape possible? Were we no betterthan chessmen, moved by an unseen power, vessels the potter fashionsat his fancy, for honour or for shame? His reason revolted againstit, and yet he felt that some tragedy was hanging over him, and thathe had been suddenly called upon to bear an intolerable burden.Actors are so fortunate. They can choose whether they will appearin tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry,laugh or shed tears. But in real life it is different. Most menand women are forced to perform parts for which they have noqualifications. Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and ourHamlets have to jest like Prince Hal. The world is a stage, but theplay is badly cast.
Suddenly Mr. Podgers entered the room. When he saw Lord Arthur hestarted, and his coarse, fat face became a sort of greenish-yellowcolour. The two men's eyes met, and for a moment there was silence.
'The Duchess has left one of her gloves here, Lord Arthur, and hasasked me to bring it to her,' said Mr. Podgers finally. 'Ah, I seeit on the sofa! Good evening.'
'Mr. Podgers, I must insist on your giving me a straightforwardanswer to a question I am going to put to you.'
'Another time, Lord Arthur, but the Duchess is anxious. I am afraidI must go.'
'You shall not go. The Duchess is in no hurry.'
'Ladies should not be kept waiting, Lord Arthur,' said Mr. Podgers,with his sickly smile. 'The fair sex is apt to be impatient.'
Lord Arthur's finely-chiselled lips curled in petulant disdain. Thepoor Duchess seemed to him of very little importance at that moment.He walked across the room to where Mr. Podgers was standing, andheld his hand out.
'Tell me what you saw there,' he said. 'Tell me the truth. I mustknow it. I am not a child.'
Mr. Podgers's eyes blinked behind his gold-rimmed spectacles, and hemoved uneasily from one foot to the other, while his fingers playednervously with a flash watch-chain.
'What makes you think that I saw anything in your hand, Lord Arthur,more than I told you?'
'I know you did, and I insist on your telling me what it was. Iwill pay you. I will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds.'
The green eyes flashed for a moment, and then became dull again.
'Guineas?' said Mr. Podgers at last, in a low voice.
'Certainly. I will send you a cheque to-morrow. What is yourclub?'
'I have no club. That is to say, not just at present. My addressis -, but allow me to give you my card'; and producing a bit ofgilt-edge pasteboard from his waistcoat pocket, Mr. Podgers handedit, with a low bow, to Lord Arthur, who read on it,
Mr. SEPTIMUS R. PODGERSProfessional Cheiromantist103a West Moon Street
'My hours are from ten to four,' murmured Mr. Podgers mechanically,'and I make a reduction for families.'
'Be quick,' cried Lord Arthur, looking very pale, and holding hishand out.
Mr. Podgers glanced nervously round, and drew the heavy portiereacross the door.
'It will take a little time, Lord Arthur, you had better sit down.'
'Be quick, sir,' cried Lord Arthur again, stamping his foot angrilyon the polished floor.
Mr. Podgers smiled, drew from his breast-pocket a small magnifyingglass, and wiped it carefully with his handkerchief
'I am quite ready,' he said.
