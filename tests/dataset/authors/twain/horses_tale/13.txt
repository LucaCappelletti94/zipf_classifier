It was a prodigious trip, but delightful, of course, through theRockies and the Black Hills and the mighty sweep of the GreatPlains to civilization and the Missouri border - where therailroading began and the delightfulness ended.  But no one is theworse for the journey; certainly not Cathy, nor Dorcas, nor SoldierBoy; and as for me, I am not complaining.
Spain is all that Cathy had pictured it - and more, she says.  Sheis in a fury of delight, the maddest little animal that ever was,and all for joy.  She thinks she remembers Spain, but that is notvery likely, I suppose.  The two - Mercedes and Cathy - devour eachother.  It is a rapture of love, and beautiful to see.  It isSpanish; that describes it.  Will this be a short visit?
No.  It will be permanent.  Cathy has elected to abide with Spainand her aunt.  Dorcas says she (Dorcas) foresaw that this wouldhappen; and also says that she wanted it to happen, and says thechild's own country is the right place for her, and that she oughtnot to have been sent to me, I ought to have gone to her.  Ithought it insane to take Soldier Boy to Spain, but it was wellthat I yielded to Cathy's pleadings; if he had been left behind,half of her heart would have remained with him, and she would nothave been contented.  As it is, everything has fallen out for thebest, and we are all satisfied and comfortable.  It may be thatDorcas and I will see America again some day; but also it is a caseof maybe not.
We left the post in the early morning.  It was an affecting time.The women cried over Cathy, so did even those stern warriors, theRocky Mountain Rangers; Shekels was there, and the Cid, andSardanapalus, and Potter, and Mongrel, and Sour-Mash, Famine, andPestilence, and Cathy kissed them all and wept; details of theseveral arms of the garrison were present to represent the rest,and say good-bye and God bless you for all the soldiery; and therewas a special squad from the Seventh, with the oldest veteran atits head, to speed the Seventh's Child with grand honors andimpressive ceremonies; and the veteran had a touching speech byheart, and put up his hand in salute and tried to say it, but hislips trembled and his voice broke, but Cathy bent down from thesaddle and kissed him on the mouth and turned his defeat tovictory, and a cheer went up.
The next act closed the ceremonies, and was a moving surprise.  Itmay be that you have discovered, before this, that the rigors ofmilitary law and custom melt insensibly away and disappear when asoldier or a regiment or the garrison wants to do something thatwill please Cathy.  The bands conceived the idea of stirring hersoldierly heart with a farewell which would remain in her memoryalways, beautiful and unfading, and bring back the past and itslove for her whenever she should think of it; so they got theirproject placed before General Burnaby, my successor, who is Cathy'snewest slave, and in spite of poverty of precedents they got hispermission.  The bands knew the child's favorite military airs.  Bythis hint you know what is coming, but Cathy didn't.  She was askedto sound the "reveille," which she did.
[REVEILLE]
With the last note the bands burst out with a crash:  and woke themountains with the "Star-Spangled Banner" in a way to make a body'sheart swell and thump and his hair rise!  It was enough to break aperson all up, to see Cathy's radiant face shining out through hergladness and tears.  By request she blew the "assembly," now. . . .
[THE ASSEMBLY]
. . . Then the bands thundered in, with "Rally round the flag,boys, rally once again!"  Next, she blew another call ("to theStandard") . . .
[TO THE STANDARD]
. . .  and the bands responded with "When we were marching throughGeorgia."  Straightway she sounded "boots and saddles," thatthrilling and most expediting call. . . .
[BOOTS AND SADDLES]
and the bands could hardly hold in for the final note; then theyturned their whole strength loose on "Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boysare marching," and everybody's excitement rose to blood-heat.
Now an impressive pause - then the bugle sang "TAPS" -translatable, this time, into "Good-bye, and God keep us all!" fortaps is the soldier's nightly release from duty, and farewell:plaintive, sweet, pathetic, for the morning is never sure, for him;always it is possible that he is hearing it for the last time. . ..
[TAPS]
. . . Then the bands turned their instruments towards Cathy andburst in with that rollicking frenzy of a tune, "Oh, we'll all getblind drunk when Johnny comes marching home - yes, we'll all getblind drunk when Johnny comes marching home!" and followed itinstantly with "Dixie," that antidote for melancholy, merriest andgladdest of all military music on any side of the ocean - and thatwas the end.  And so - farewell!
I wish you could have been there to see it all, hear it all, andfeel it:  and get yourself blown away with the hurricane huzza thatswept the place as a finish.
When we rode away, our main body had already been on the road anhour or two - I speak of our camp equipage; but we didn't move offalone:  when Cathy blew the "advance" the Rangers cantered out incolumn of fours, and gave us escort, and were joined by White Cloudand Thunder -Bird in all their gaudy bravery, and by Buffalo Billand four subordinate scouts.  Three miles away, in the Plains, theLieutenant-General halted, sat her horse like a military statue,the bugle at her lips, and put the Rangers through the evolutionsfor half an hour; and finally, when she blew the "charge," she ledit herself.  "Not for the last time," she said, and got a cheer,and we said good-bye all around, and faced eastward and rode away.
POSTSCRIPT.  A DAY LATER.  Soldier Boy was stolen last night.Cathy is almost beside herself, and we cannot comfort her.Mercedes and I are not much alarmed about the horse, although thispart of Spain is in something of a turmoil, politically, atpresent, and there is a good deal of lawlessness.  In ordinarytimes the thief and the horse would soon be captured.  We shallhave them before long, I think.
