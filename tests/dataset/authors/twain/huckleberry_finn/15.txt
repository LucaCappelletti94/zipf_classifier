Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, andwe made for a towhead to tie to, for it wouldn't do totry to run in a fog; but when I paddled ahead in thecanoe, with the line to make fast, there warn't any-thing but little saplings to tie to. I passed the linearound one of them right on the edge of the cut bank,but there was a stiff current, and the raft come boom-ing down so lively she tore it out by the roots andaway she went. I see the fog closing down, and itmade me so sick and scared I couldn't budge for mosta half a minute it seemed to me -- and then there warn'tno raft in sight; you couldn't see twenty yards. Ijumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, andgrabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. Butshe didn't come. I was in such a hurry I hadn'tuntied her. I got up and tried to untie her, but I wasso excited my hands shook so I couldn't hardly doanything with them.
As soon as I got started I took out after the raft,hot and heavy, right down the towhead. That wasall right as far as it went, but the towhead warn'tsixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot ofit I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn't nomore idea which way I was going than a dead man.
Thinks I, it won't do to paddle; first I know I'llrun into the bank or a towhead or something; I gotto set still and float, and yet it's mighty fidgety busi-ness to have to hold your hands still at such a time. Iwhooped and listened. Away down there somewheresI hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. Iwent tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again.The next time it come I see I warn't heading for it,but heading away to the right of it. And the nexttime I was heading away to the left of it -- and notgaining on it much either, for I was flying around, thisway and that and t'other, but it was going straightahead all the time.
I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan,and beat it all the time, but he never did, and it wasthe still places between the whoops that was makingthe trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and directlyI hears the whoop BEHIND me. I was tangled goodnow. That was somebody else's whoop, or else I wasturned around.
I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoopagain; it was behind me yet, but in a different place;it kept coming, and kept changing its place, and I keptanswering, till by and by it was in front of me again,and I knowed the current had swung the canoe's headdown-stream, and I was all right if that was Jim andnot some other raftsman hollering. I couldn't tellnothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don't looknatural nor sound natural in a fog.
The whooping went on, and in about a minute Icome a-booming down on a cut bank with smokyghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed meoff to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags thatfairly roared, the currrent was tearing by them so swift.
In another second or two it was solid white and stillagain. I set perfectly still then, listening to my heartthump, and I reckon I didn't draw a breath while itthumped a hundred.
I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was.That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone downt'other side of it. It warn't no towhead that youcould float by in ten minutes. It had the big timberof a regular island; it might be five or six miles longand more than half a mile wide.
I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteenminutes, I reckon. I was floating along, of course,four or five miles an hour; but you don't ever thinkof that. No, you FEEL like you are laying dead still onthe water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips byyou don't think to yourself how fast YOU'RE going, butyou catch your breath and think, my! how that snag'stearing along. If you think it ain't dismal and lone-some out in a fog that way by yourself in the night,you try it once -- you'll see.
Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now andthen; at last I hears the answer a long ways off, andtries to follow it, but I couldn't do it, and directly Ijudged I'd got into a nest of towheads, for I had littledim glimpses of them on both sides of me -- sometimesjust a narrow channel between, and some that Icouldn't see I knowed was there because I'd hear thewash of the current against the old dead brush andtrash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn't longloosing the whoops down amongst the towheads; andI only tried to chase them a little while, anyway, be-cause it was worse than chasing a Jack-o'-lantern.You never knowed a sound dodge around so, andswap places so quick and so much.
I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively fouror five times, to keep from knocking the islands out ofthe river; and so I judged the raft must be buttinginto the bank every now and then, or else it would getfurther ahead and clear out of hearing -- it was floatinga little faster than what I was.
Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by andby, but I couldn't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres.I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag, maybe, andit was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I laiddown in the canoe and said I wouldn't bother nomore. I didn't want to go to sleep, of course; but Iwas so sleepy I couldn't help it; so I thought I wouldtake jest one little cat-nap.
But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when Iwaked up the stars was shining bright, the fog was allgone, and I was spinning down a big bend stern first.First I didn't know where I was; I thought I wasdreaming; and when things began to come back to methey seemed to come up dim out of last week.
It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallestand the thickest kind of timber on both banks; just asolid wall, as well as I could see by the stars. I lookedaway down-stream, and seen a black speck on thewater. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn'tnothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together.Then I see another speck, and chased that; thenanother, and this time I was right. It was the raft.
When I got to it Jim was setting there with his headdown between his knees, asleep, with his right armhanging over the steering-oar. The other oar wassmashed off, and the raft was littered up with leavesand branches and dirt. So she'd had a rough time.
I made fast and laid down under Jim's nose on theraft, and began to gap, and stretch my fists out againstJim, and says:
"Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn't youstir me up?"
"Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En youain' dead -- you ain' drownded -- you's back agin?It's too good for true, honey, it's too good for true.Lemme look at you chile, lemme feel o' you. No,you ain' dead! you's back agin, 'live en soun', jis desame ole Huck -- de same ole Huck, thanks to good-ness!"
"What's the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?"
"Drinkin'? Has I ben a-drinkin'? Has I had achance to be a-drinkin'?"
"Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?"
"How does I talk wild?"
"HOW? Why, hain't you been talking about mycoming back, and all that stuff, as if I'd been goneaway?"
"Huck -- Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; lookme in de eye. HAIN'T you ben gone away?"
"Gone away? Why, what in the nation do youmean? I hain't been gone anywheres. Where wouldI go to?"
"Well, looky here, boss, dey's sumf'n wrong, deyis. Is I ME, or who IS I? Is I heah, or whah IS I?Now dat's what I wants to know."
"Well, I think you're here, plain enough, but Ithink you're a tangle-headed old fool, Jim."
"I is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn't youtote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas' to de tow-head?"
"No, I didn't. What tow-head? I hain't see notow-head."
"You hain't seen no towhead? Looky here, didn'tde line pull loose en de raf' go a-hummin' down deriver, en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?"
"What fog?"
"Why, de fog! -- de fog dat's been aroun' all night.En didn't you whoop, en didn't I whoop, tell we gotmix' up in de islands en one un us got los' en t'otherone was jis' as good as los', 'kase he didn' know whahhe wuz? En didn't I bust up agin a lot er dem islandsen have a turrible time en mos' git drownded? Nowain' dat so, boss -- ain't it so? You answer me dat."
"Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain't seenno fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing.I been setting here talking with you all night till youwent to sleep about ten minutes ago, and I reckon Idone the same. You couldn't a got drunk in thattime, so of course you've been dreaming."
"Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat inten minutes?"
"Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because theredidn't any of it happen."
"But, Huck, it's all jis' as plain to me as --"
"It don't make no difference how plain it is; thereain't nothing in it. I know, because I've been hereall the time."
Jim didn't say nothing for about five minutes, butset there studying over it. Then he says:
"Well, den, I reck'n I did dream it, Huck; butdog my cats ef it ain't de powerfullest dream I eversee. En I hain't ever had no dream b'fo' dat's tiredme like dis one."
"Oh, well, that's all right, because a dream doestire a body like everything sometimes. But this onewas a staving dream; tell me all about it, Jim."
So Jim went to work and told me the whole thingright through, just as it happened, only he painted itup considerable. Then he said he must start in and"'terpret" it, because it was sent for a warning. Hesaid the first towhead stood for a man that would tryto do us some good, but the current was another manthat would get us away from him. The whoops waswarnings that would come to us every now and then,and if we didn't try hard to make out to understandthem they'd just take us into bad luck, 'stead of keep-ing us out of it. The lot of towheads was troubleswe was going to get into with quarrelsome people andall kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our businessand didn't talk back and aggravate them, we wouldpull through and get out of the fog and into the bigclear river, which was the free States, and wouldn'thave no more trouble.
It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on tothe raft, but it was clearing up again now.
"Oh, well, that's all interpreted well enough as faras it goes, Jim," I says; "but what does THESE thingsstand for?"
It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and thesmashed oar. You could see them first-rate now.
Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, andback at the trash again. He had got the dream fixedso strong in his head that he couldn't seem to shake itloose and get the facts back into its place again rightaway. But when he did get the thing straightenedaround he looked at me steady without ever smiling,and says:
"What do dey stan' for? I'se gwyne to tell you.When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin'for you, en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos' brokebekase you wuz los', en I didn' k'yer no' mo' whatbecome er me en de raf'. En when I wake up en fineyou back agin, all safe en soun', de tears come, en Icould a got down on my knees en kiss yo' foot, I's sothankful. En all you wuz thinkin' 'bout wuz how youcould make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dahis TRASH; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on dehead er dey fren's en makes 'em ashamed."
Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam,and went in there without saying anything but that.But that was enough. It made me feel so mean Icould almost kissed HIS foot to get him to take it back.
It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself upto go and humble myself to a nigger; but I done it,and I warn't ever sorry for it afterwards, neither. Ididn't do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn'tdone that one if I'd a knowed it would make him feelthat way.
