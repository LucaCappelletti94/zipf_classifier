The Maid's Sword and Banner
JOAN'S first official act was to dictate a letter to the Englishcommanders at Orleans, summoning them to deliver up all strongholds intheir possession and depart out of France. She must have been thinking itall out before and arranging it in her mind, it flowed from her lips sosmoothly, and framed itself into such vivacious and forcible language.Still, it might not have been so; she always had a quick mind and acapable tongue, and her faculties were constantly developing in theselatter weeks. This letter was to be forwarded presently from Blois. Men,provisions, and money were offering in plenty now, and Joan appointedBlois as a recruiting-station and depot of supplies, and ordered up LaHire from the front to take charge.
The Great Bastard--him of the ducal house, and governor of Orleans--hadbeen clamoring for weeks for Joan to be sent to him, and now came anothermessenger, old D'Aulon, a veteran officer, a trusty man and fine andhonest. The King kept him, and gave him to Joan to be chief of herhousehold, and commanded her to appoint the rest of her people herself,making their number and dignity accord with the greatness of her office;and at the same time he gave order that they should be properly equippedwith arms, clothing, and horses.
Meantime the King was having a complete suit of armor made for her atTours. It was of the finest steel, heavily plated with silver, richlyornamented with engraved designs, and polished like a mirror.
Joan's Voices had told her that there was an ancient sword hiddensomewhere behind the altar of St. Catherine's at Fierbois, and she sentDe Metz to get it. The priests knew of no such sword, but a search wasmade, and sure enough it was found in that place, buried a little wayunder the ground. It had no sheath and was very rusty, but the priestspolished it up and sent it to Tours, whither we were now to come. Theyalso had a sheath of crimson velvet made for it, and the people of Toursequipped it with another, made of cloth-of-gold. But Joan meant to carrythis sword always in battle; so she laid the showy sheaths away and gotone made of leather. It was generally believed that his sword hadbelonged to Charlemagne, but that was only a matter of opinion. I wantedto sharpen that old blade, but she said it was not necessary, as sheshould never kill anybody, and should carry it only as a symbol ofauthority.
At Tours she designed her Standard, and a Scotch painter named JamesPower made it. It was of the most delicate white boucassin, with fringesof silk. For device it bore the image of God the Father throned in theclouds and holding the world in His hand; two angels knelt at His feet,presenting lilies; inscription, JESUS, MARIA; on the reverse the crown ofFrance supported by two angels.
She also caused a smaller standard or pennon to be made, whereon wasrepresented an angel offering a lily to the Holy Virgin.
Everything was humming there at Tours. Every now and then one heard thebray and crash of military music, every little while one heard themeasured tramp of marching men--squads of recruits leaving for Blois;songs and shoutings and huzzas filled the air night and day, the town wasfull of strangers, the streets and inns were thronged, the bustle ofpreparation was everywhere, and everybody carried a glad and cheerfulface. Around Joan's headquarters a crowd of people was always massed,hoping for a glimpse of the new General, and when they got it, they wentwild; but they seldom got it, for she was busy planning her campaign,receiving reports, giving orders, despatching couriers, and giving whatodd moments she could spare to the companies of great folk waiting in thedrawing-rooms. As for us boys, we hardly saw her at all, she was sooccupied.
We were in a mixed state of mind--sometimes hopeful, sometimes not;mostly not. She had not appointed her household yet--that was ourtrouble. We knew she was being overrun with applications for places init, and that these applications were backed by great names and weightyinfluence, whereas we had nothing of the sort to recommend us. She couldfill her humblest places with titled folk--folk whose relationships wouldbe a bulwark for her and a valuable support at all times. In thesecircumstances would policy allow her to consider us? We were not ascheerful as the rest of the town, but were inclined to be depressed andworried. Sometimes we discussed our slim chances and gave them as good anappearance as we could. But the very mention of the subject was anguishto the Paladin; for whereas we had some little hope, he had none at all.As a rule Noel Rainguesson was quite with Hireing to let the dismalmatter alone; but not when the Paladin was present. Once we were talkingthe thing over, when Noel said:
"Cheer up, Paladin, I had a dream last night, and you were the only oneamong us that got an appointment. It wasn't a high one, but it was anappointment, anyway--some kind of a lackey or body-servant, or somethingof that kind."
The Paladin roused up and looked almost cheerful; for he was a believerin dreams, and in anything and everything of a superstitious sort, infact. He said, with a rising hopefulness:
"I wish it might come true. Do you think it will come true?"
"Certainly; I might almost say I know it will, for my dreams hardly everfail."
"Noel, I could hug you if that dream could come true, I could, indeed! Tobe servant of the first General of France and have all the world hear ofit, and the news go back to the village and make those gawks stare thatalways said I wouldn't ever amount to anything--wouldn't it be great! Doyou think it will come true, Noel? Don't you believe it will?"
"I do. There's my hand on it."
"Noel, if it comes true I'll never forget you--shake again! I should bedressed in a noble livery, and the news would go to the village, andthose animals would say, 'Him, lackey to the General-in-Chief, with theeyes of the whole world on him, admiring--well, he has shot up into thesky now, hasn't he!"
He began to walk the floor and pile castles in the air so fast and sohigh that we could hardly keep up with him. Then all of a sudden all thejoy went out of his face and misery took its place, and he said:
"Oh, dear, it is all a mistake, it will never come true. I forgot thatfoolish business at Toul. I have kept out of her sight as much as Icould, all these weeks, hoping she would forget that and forgive it --butI know she never will. She can't, of course. And, after all, I wasn't toblame. I did say she promised to marry me, but they put me up to it andpersuaded me. I swear they did!" The vast creature was almost crying.Then he pulled himself together and said, remorsefully, "It was the onlylie I've ever told, and--"
He was drowned out with a chorus of groans and outraged exclamations; andbefore he could begin again, one of D'Aulon's liveried servants appearedand said we were required at headquarters. We rose, and Noel said:
"There--what did I tell you? I have a presentiment--the spirit ofprophecy is upon me. She is going to appoint him, and we are to go thereand do him homage. Come along!"
But the Paladin was afraid to go, so we left him.
When we presently stood in the presence, in front of a crowd ofglittering officers of the army, Joan greeted us with a winning smile,and said she appointed all of us to places in her household, for shewanted her old friends by her. It was a beautiful surprise to haveourselves honored like this when she could have had people of birth andconsequence instead, but we couldn't find our tongues to say so, she wasbecome so great and so high above us now. One at a time we steppedforward and each received his warrant from the hand of our chief,D'Aulon. All of us had honorable places; the two knights stood highest;then Joan's two brothers; I was first page and secretary, a younggentleman named Raimond was second page; Noel was her messenger; she hadtwo heralds, and also a chaplain and almoner, whose name was JeanPasquerel. She had previously appointed a maitre d'hotel and a number ofdomestics. Now she looked around and said:
"But where is the Paladin?"
The Sieur Bertrand said:
"He thought he was not sent for, your Excellency."
"Now that is not well. Let him be called."
The Paladin entered humbly enough. He ventured no farther than justwithin the door. He stopped there, looking embarrassed and afraid. ThenJoan spoke pleasantly, and said:
"I watched you on the road. You began badly, but improved. Of old youwere a fantastic talker, but there is a man in you, and I will bring itout." It was fine to see the Paladin's face light up when she said that."Will you follow where I lead?"
"Into the fire!" he said; and I said to myself, "By the ring of that, Ithink she has turned this braggart into a hero. It is another of hermiracles, I make no doubt of it."
"I believe you," said Joan. "Here--take my banner. You will ride with mein every field, and when France is saved, you will give it me back."
He took the banner, which is now the most precious of the memorials thatremain of Joan of Arc, and his voice was unsteady with emotion when hesaid:
"If I ever disgrace this trust, my comrades here will know how to do afriend's office upon my body, and this charge I lay upon them, as knowingthey will not fail me."
