We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and whenAunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found outhow good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they madea heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, andgive him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, andnothing to do. And we had him up to the sick-room,and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollarsfor being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up sogood, and Jim was pleased most to death, and bustedout, and says:
"DAH, now, Huck, what I tell you? -- what I tellyou up dah on Jackson islan'? I TOLE you I got ahairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en I TOLE you Iben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich AGIN; en it'scome true; en heah she is! DAH, now! doan' talkto ME -- signs is SIGNS, mine I tell you; en I knowedjis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich agin as I's a-stannin' heah dis minute!"
And then Tom he talked along and talked along,and says, le's all three slide out of here one of thesenights and get an outfit, and go for howling adventuresamongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a coupleof weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me,but I ain't got no money for to buy the outfit, and Ireckon I couldn't get none from home, because it'slikely pap's been back before now, and got it all awayfrom Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.
"No, he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there yet --six thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain'tever been back since. Hadn't when I come away,anyhow."
Jim says, kind of solemn:
"He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."
I says:
"Why, Jim?"
"Nemmine why, Huck -- but he ain't comin' backno mo."
But I kept at him; so at last he says:
"Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n downde river, en dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en Iwent in en unkivered him and didn' let you come in?Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it,kase dat wuz him."
Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around hisneck on a watch-guard for a watch, and is alwaysseeing what time it is, and so there ain't nothing moreto write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because ifI'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book Iwouldn't a tackled it, and ain't a-going to no more.But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory aheadof the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adoptme and sivilize me, and I can't stand it. I been therebefore.
