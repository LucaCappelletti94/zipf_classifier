"Remove these rags"--meaning his clothing.
Hendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked himup in bed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself,ruefully, "He hath taken my bed again, as before--marry, whatshall _I_ do?"  The little King observed his perplexity, anddissipated it with a word.  He said, sleepily--
"Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it."  In a momentmore he was out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.
"Dear heart, he should have been born a king!" muttered Hendon,admiringly; "he playeth the part to a marvel."
Then he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, sayingcontentedly--
"I have lodged worse for seven years; 'twould be but ill gratitudeto Him above to find fault with this."
He dropped asleep as the dawn appeared.  Toward noon he rose,uncovered his unconscious ward--a section at a time--and took hismeasure with a string.  The King awoke, just as he had completedhis work, complained of the cold, and asked what he was doing.
"'Tis done, now, my liege," said Hendon; "I have a bit of businessoutside, but will presently return; sleep thou again--thou needestit.  There--let me cover thy head also--thou'lt be warm thesooner."
The King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended.Miles slipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in thecourse of thirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-handsuit of boy's clothing, of cheap material, and showing signs ofwear; but tidy, and suited to the season of the year.  He seatedhimself, and began to overhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself--
"A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has notthe long purse one must be content with what a short one may do--
     "'There was a woman in our town,        In our town did dwell--'
"He stirred, methinks--I must sing in a less thunderous key; 'tisnot good to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he sowearied out, poor chap . . . This garment--'tis well enough--astitch here and another one there will set it aright.  This otheris better, albeit a stitch or two will not come amiss in it,likewise . . . THESE be very good and sound, and will keep hissmall feet warm and dry--an odd new thing to him, belike, since hehas doubtless been used to foot it bare, winters and summers thesame . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one getteth a year'ssufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle withoutcost, for mere love.  Now shall I have the demon's own time tothread it!"
And so he had.  He did as men have always done, and probablyalways will do, to the end of time--held the needle still, andtried to thrust the thread through the eye, which is the oppositeof a woman's way.  Time and time again the thread missed the mark,going sometimes on one side of the needle, sometimes on the other,sometimes doubling up against the shaft; but he was patient,having been through these experiences before, when he wassoldiering.  He succeeded at last, and took up the garment thathad lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.
"The inn is paid--the breakfast that is to come, included--andthere is wherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet ourlittle costs for the two or three days betwixt this and the plentythat awaits us at Hendon Hall--
     "'She loved her hus--'
"Body o' me!  I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . Itmatters little--'tis not a novelty--yet 'tis not a convenience,neither . . .We shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it!Thy troubles will vanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper--
     "'She loved her husband dearilee,       But another man--'
"These be noble large stitches!"--holding the garment up andviewing it admiringly--"they have a grandeur and a majesty that docause these small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightilypaltry and plebeian--
     "'She loved her husband dearilee,       But another man he loved she,--'
"Marry, 'tis done--a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought withexpedition.  Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feedhim, and then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn inSouthwark and--be pleased to rise, my liege!--he answereth not--what ho, my liege!--of a truth must I profane his sacred personwith a touch, sith his slumber is deaf to speech.  What!"
He threw back the covers--the boy was gone!
He stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment;noticed for the first time that his ward's ragged raiment was alsomissing; then he began to rage and storm and shout for theinnkeeper.  At that moment a servant entered with the breakfast.
"Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!" roared the manof war, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that thislatter could not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright andsurprise.  "Where is the boy?"
In disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the informationdesired.
"You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youthcame running and said it was your worship's will that the boy cometo you straight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side.  Ibrought him hither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message,the lad did grumble some little for being disturbed 'so early,' ashe called it, but straightway trussed on his rags and went withthe youth, only saying it had been better manners that yourworship came yourself, not sent a stranger--and so--"
"And so thou'rt a fool!--a fool and easily cozened--hang all thybreed!  Yet mayhap no hurt is done.  Possibly no harm is meant theboy.  I will go fetch him.  Make the table ready.  Stay! thecoverings of the bed were disposed as if one lay beneath them--happened that by accident?"
"I know not, good your worship.  I saw the youth meddle with them--he that came for the boy."
"Thousand deaths!  'Twas done to deceive me--'tis plain 'twas doneto gain time.  Hark ye!  Was that youth alone?"
"All alone, your worship."
"Art sure?"
"Sure, your worship."
"Collect thy scattered wits--bethink thee--take time, man."
After a moment's thought, the servant said--
"When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that asthe two stepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-lookingman plunged out from some near place; and just as he was joiningthem--"
"What THEN?--out with it!" thundered the impatient Hendon,interrupting.
"Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I sawno more, being called by my master, who was in a rage because ajoint that the scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take allthe saints to witness that to blame ME for that miscarriage werelike holding the unborn babe to judgment for sins com--"
"Out of my sight, idiot!  Thy prating drives me mad!  Hold!Whither art flying?  Canst not bide still an instant?  Went theytoward Southwark?"
"Even so, your worship--for, as I said before, as to thatdetestable joint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--"
"Art here YET!  And prating still!  Vanish, lest I throttle thee!"The servitor vanished.  Hendon followed after him, passed him, andplunged down the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, "'Tisthat scurvy villain that claimed he was his son.  I have lostthee, my poor little mad master--it is a bitter thought--and I hadcome to love thee so!  No! by book and bell, NOT lost!  Not lost,for I will ransack the land till I find thee again.  Poor child,yonder is his breakfast--and mine, but I have no hunger now; so,let the rats have it--speed, speed! that is the word!"  As hewormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes upon the Bridgehe several times said to himself--clinging to the thought as if itwere a particularly pleasing one--"He grumbled, but he WENT--hewent, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet lad--hewould ne'er have done it for another, I know it well."
