  Now I am all	One bowl of kisses,	Such as the tall	Slim votaresses	Of Egypt filled For a God's excesses.	 I lift to you	My bowl of kisses,	And through the temple's	Blue recesses Cry out to you	In wild caresses.	 And to my lips'	Bright crimson rim	The passion slips, And down my slim	White body drips	The shining hymn.	 And still before	The altar I Exult the bowl	Brimful, and cry	To you to stoop	And drink, Most High.	 Oh drink me up That I may be	Within your cup	Like a mystery,	Like wine that is still	In ecstasy.  Glimmering still	In ecstasy,	Commingled wines	Of you and me	In one fulfil The mystery.
