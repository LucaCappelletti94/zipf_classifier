We are getting foreignized rapidly and with facility. We are gettingreconciled to halls and bedchambers with unhomelike stone floors and nocarpets--floors that ring to the tread of one's heels with a sharpnessthat is death to sentimental musing. We are getting used to tidy,noiseless waiters, who glide hither and thither, and hover about yourback and your elbows like butterflies, quick to comprehend orders, quickto fill them; thankful for a gratuity without regard to the amount; andalways polite--never otherwise than polite. That is the strangestcuriosity yet--a really polite hotel waiter who isn't an idiot. We aregetting used to driving right into the central court of the hotel, in themidst of a fragrant circle of vines and flowers, and in the midst also ofparties of gentlemen sitting quietly reading the paper and smoking. Weare getting used to ice frozen by artificial process in ordinary bottles--the only kind of ice they have here. We are getting used to all thesethings, but we are not getting used to carrying our own soap. We aresufficiently civilized to carry our own combs and toothbrushes, but thisthing of having to ring for soap every time we wash is new to us and notpleasant at all. We think of it just after we get our heads and facesthoroughly wet or just when we think we have been in the bathtub longenough, and then, of course, an annoying delay follows. TheseMarseillaises make Marseillaise hymns and Marseilles vests and Marseillessoap for all the world, but they never sing their hymns or wear theirvests or wash with their soap themselves.
We have learned to go through the lingering routine of the table d'hotewith patience, with serenity, with satisfaction. We take soup, then waita few minutes for the fish; a few minutes more and the plates arechanged, and the roast beef comes; another change and we take peas;change again and take lentils; change and take snail patties (I prefergrasshoppers); change and take roast chicken and salad; then strawberrypie and ice cream; then green figs, pears, oranges, green almonds, etc.;finally coffee. Wine with every course, of course, being in France.With such a cargo on board, digestion is a slow process, and we must sitlong in the cool chambers and smoke--and read French newspapers, whichhave a strange fashion of telling a perfectly straight story till you getto the "nub" of it, and then a word drops in that no man can translate,and that story is ruined. An embankment fell on some Frenchmenyesterday, and the papers are full of it today--but whether thosesufferers were killed, or crippled, or bruised, or only scared is morethan I can possibly make out, and yet I would just give anything to know.
We were troubled a little at dinner today by the conduct of an American,who talked very loudly and coarsely and laughed boisterously where allothers were so quiet and well behaved. He ordered wine with a royalflourish and said:
"I never dine without wine, sir" (which was a pitiful falsehood), andlooked around upon the company to bask in the admiration he expected tofind in their faces. All these airs in a land where they would as soonexpect to leave the soup out of the bill of fare as the wine!--in a landwhere wine is nearly as common among all ranks as water! This fellowsaid: "I am a free-born sovereign, sir, an American, sir, and I wanteverybody to know it!" He did not mention that he was a linealdescendant of Balaam's ass, but everybody knew that without his tellingit.
We have driven in the Prado--that superb avenue bordered with patricianmansions and noble shade trees--and have visited the chateau Boarely andits curious museum. They showed us a miniature cemetery there--a copy ofthe first graveyard that was ever in Marseilles, no doubt. The delicatelittle skeletons were lying in broken vaults and had their household godsand kitchen utensils with them. The original of this cemetery was dug upin the principal street of the city a few years ago. It had remainedthere, only twelve feet underground, for a matter of twenty-five hundredyears or thereabouts. Romulus was here before he built Rome, and thoughtsomething of founding a city on this spot, but gave up the idea. He mayhave been personally acquainted with some of these Phoenicians whoseskeletons we have been examining.
In the great Zoological Gardens we found specimens of all the animals theworld produces, I think, including a dromedary, a monkey ornamented withtufts of brilliant blue and carmine hair--a very gorgeous monkey he was--a hippopotamus from the Nile, and a sort of tall, long-legged bird with abeak like a powder horn and close-fitting wings like the tails of a dresscoat. This fellow stood up with his eyes shut and his shoulders stoopedforward a little, and looked as if he had his hands under his coattails. Such tranquil stupidity, such supernatural gravity, suchself-righteousness, and such ineffable self-complacency as were in thecountenance and attitude of that gray-bodied, dark-winged, bald-headed,and preposterously uncomely bird! He was so ungainly, so pimply aboutthe head, so scaly about the legs, yet so serene, so unspeakablysatisfied! He was the most comical-looking creature that can beimagined. It was good to hear Dan and the doctor laugh--such natural andsuch enjoyable laughter had not been heard among our excursionists sinceour ship sailed away from America. This bird was a godsend to us, and Ishould be an ingrate if I forgot to make honorable mention of him inthese pages. Ours was a pleasure excursion; therefore we stayed withthat bird an hour and made the most of him. We stirred him upoccasionally, but he only unclosed an eye and slowly closed it again,abating no jot of his stately piety of demeanor or his tremendousseriousness. He only seemed to say, "Defile not Heaven's anointed withunsanctified hands." We did not know his name, and so we called him "ThePilgrim." Dan said:
"All he wants now is a Plymouth Collection."
The boon companion of the colossal elephant was a common cat! This cathad a fashion of climbing up the elephant's hind legs and roosting on hisback. She would sit up there, with her paws curved under her breast, andsleep in the sun half the afternoon. It used to annoy the elephant atfirst, and he would reach up and take her down, but she would go aft andclimb up again. She persisted until she finally conquered the elephant'sprejudices, and now they are inseparable friends. The cat plays abouther comrade's forefeet or his trunk often, until dogs approach, and thenshe goes aloft out of danger. The elephant has annihilated several dogslately that pressed his companion too closely.
We hired a sailboat and a guide and made an excursion to one of the smallislands in the harbor to visit the Castle d'If. This ancient fortresshas a melancholy history. It has been used as a prison for politicaloffenders for two or three hundred years, and its dungeon walls arescarred with the rudely carved names of many and many a captive whofretted his life away here and left no record of himself but these sadepitaphs wrought with his own hands. How thick the names were! Andtheir long-departed owners seemed to throng the gloomy cells andcorridors with their phantom shapes. We loitered through dungeon afterdungeon, away down into the living rock below the level of the sea, itseemed. Names everywhere!--some plebeian, some noble, some evenprincely. Plebeian, prince, and noble had one solicitude in common--theywould not be forgotten! They could suffer solitude, inactivity, and thehorrors of a silence that no sound ever disturbed, but they could notbear the thought of being utterly forgotten by the world. Hence thecarved names. In one cell, where a little light penetrated, a man hadlived twenty-seven years without seeing the face of a human being--livedin filth and wretchedness, with no companionship but his own thoughts,and they were sorrowful enough and hopeless enough, no doubt. Whateverhis jailers considered that he needed was conveyed to his cell by nightthrough a wicket.
This man carved the walls of his prison house from floor to roof with allmanner of figures of men and animals grouped in intricate designs. Hehad toiled there year after year, at his self-appointed task, whileinfants grew to boyhood--to vigorous youth--idled through school andcollege--acquired a profession--claimed man's mature estate--married andlooked back to infancy as to a thing of some vague, ancient time, almost.But who shall tell how many ages it seemed to this prisoner? With theone, time flew sometimes; with the other, never--it crawled always. Tothe one, nights spent in dancing had seemed made of minutes instead ofhours; to the other, those selfsame nights had been like all other nightsof dungeon life and seemed made of slow, dragging weeks instead of hoursand minutes.
One prisoner of fifteen years had scratched verses upon his walls, andbrief prose sentences--brief, but full of pathos. These spoke not ofhimself and his hard estate, but only of the shrine where his spirit fledthe prison to worship--of home and the idols that were templed there.He never lived to see them.
The walls of these dungeons are as thick as some bed-chambers at home arewide--fifteen feet. We saw the damp, dismal cells in which two of Dumas'heroes passed their confinement--heroes of "Monte Cristo." It was herethat the brave Abbe wrote a book with his own blood, with a pen made of apiece of iron hoop, and by the light of a lamp made out of shreds ofcloth soaked in grease obtained from his food; and then dug through thethick wall with some trifling instrument which he wrought himself out ofa stray piece of iron or table cutlery and freed Dantes from his chains.It was a pity that so many weeks of dreary labor should have come tonaught at last.
They showed us the noisome cell where the celebrated "Iron Mask"--thatill-starred brother of a hardhearted king of France--was confined for aseason before he was sent to hide the strange mystery of his life fromthe curious in the dungeons of Ste. Marguerite. The place had a fargreater interest for us than it could have had if we had known beyond allquestion who the Iron Mask was, and what his history had been, and whythis most unusual punishment had been meted out to him. Mystery! Thatwas the charm. That speechless tongue, those prisoned features, thatheart so freighted with unspoken troubles, and that breast so oppressedwith its piteous secret had been here. These dank walls had known theman whose dolorous story is a sealed book forever! There was fascinationin the spot.
