The ship is lying here in the harbor of Naples--quarantined. She hasbeen here several days and will remain several more. We that came byrail from Rome have escaped this misfortune. Of course no one is allowedto go on board the ship, or come ashore from her. She is a prison, now.The passengers probably spend the long, blazing days looking out fromunder the awnings at Vesuvius and the beautiful city--and in swearing.Think of ten days of this sort of pastime!--We go out every day in a boatand request them to come ashore. It soothes them. We lie ten steps fromthe ship and tell them how splendid the city is; and how much better thehotel fare is here than any where else in Europe; and how cool it is; andwhat frozen continents of ice cream there are; and what a time we arehaving cavorting about the country and sailing to the islands in the Bay.This tranquilizes them.
 ASCENT OF VESUVIUS.
I shall remember our trip to Vesuvius for many a day--partly because ofits sight-seeing experiences, but chiefly on account of the fatigue ofthe journey. Two or three of us had been resting ourselves among thetranquil and beautiful scenery of the island of Ischia, eighteen milesout in the harbor, for two days; we called it "resting," but I do notremember now what the resting consisted of, for when we got back toNaples we had not slept for forty-eight hours. We were just about to goto bed early in the evening, and catch up on some of the sleep we hadlost, when we heard of this Vesuvius expedition. There was to be eightof us in the party, and we were to leave Naples at midnight. We laid insome provisions for the trip, engaged carriages to take us toAnnunciation, and then moved about the city, to keep awake, till twelve.We got away punctually, and in the course of an hour and a half arrivedat the town of Annunciation. Annunciation is the very last place underthe sun. In other towns in Italy the people lie around quietly and waitfor you to ask them a question or do some overt act that can be chargedfor--but in Annunciation they have lost even that fragment of delicacy;they seize a lady's shawl from a chair and hand it to her and charge apenny; they open a carriage door, and charge for it--shut it when you getout, and charge for it; they help you to take off a duster--two cents;brush your clothes and make them worse than they were before--two cents;smile upon you--two cents; bow, with a lick-spittle smirk, hat in hand--two cents; they volunteer all information, such as that the mules willarrive presently--two cents--warm day, sir--two cents--take you fourhours to make the ascent--two cents. And so they go. They crowd you--infest you--swarm about you, and sweat and smell offensively, and looksneaking and mean, and obsequious. There is no office too degrading forthem to perform, for money. I have had no opportunity to find out anything about the upper classes by my own observation, but from what I hearsaid about them I judge that what they lack in one or two of the badtraits the canaille have, they make up in one or two others that areworse. How the people beg!--many of them very well dressed, too.
I said I knew nothing against the upper classes by personal observation.I must recall it! I had forgotten. What I saw their bravest and theirfairest do last night, the lowest multitude that could be scraped up outof the purlieus of Christendom would blush to do, I think. Theyassembled by hundreds, and even thousands, in the great Theatre of SanCarlo, to do--what? Why, simply, to make fun of an old woman--to deride,to hiss, to jeer at an actress they once worshipped, but whose beauty isfaded now and whose voice has lost its former richness. Every body spokeof the rare sport there was to be. They said the theatre would becrammed, because Frezzolini was going to sing. It was said she could notsing well, now, but then the people liked to see her, anyhow. And so wewent. And every time the woman sang they hissed and laughed--the wholemagnificent house--and as soon as she left the stage they called her onagain with applause. Once or twice she was encored five and six times insuccession, and received with hisses when she appeared, and dischargedwith hisses and laughter when she had finished--then instantly encoredand insulted again! And how the high-born knaves enjoyed it!White-kidded gentlemen and ladies laughed till the tears came, andclapped their hands in very ecstacy when that unhappy old woman wouldcome meekly out for the sixth time, with uncomplaining patience, to meeta storm of hisses! It was the cruelest exhibition--the most wanton, themost unfeeling. The singer would have conquered an audience of Americanrowdies by her brave, unflinching tranquillity (for she answered encoreafter encore, and smiled and bowed pleasantly, and sang the best shepossibly could, and went bowing off, through all the jeers and hisses,without ever losing countenance or temper:) and surely in any other landthan Italy her sex and her helplessness must have been an ampleprotection to her--she could have needed no other. Think what amultitude of small souls were crowded into that theatre last night. Ifthe manager could have filled his theatre with Neapolitan souls alone,without the bodies, he could not have cleared less than ninety millionsof dollars. What traits of character must a man have to enable him tohelp three thousand miscreants to hiss, and jeer, and laugh at onefriendless old woman, and shamefully humiliate her? He must have allthe vile, mean traits there are. My observation persuades me (I do notlike to venture beyond my own personal observation,) that the upperclasses of Naples possess those traits of character. Otherwise they maybe very good people; I can not say.
 ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.
In this city of Naples, they believe in and support one of thewretchedest of all the religious impostures one can find in Italy--themiraculous liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius. Twice a year thepriests assemble all the people at the Cathedral, and get out this vialof clotted blood and let them see it slowly dissolve and become liquid--and every day for eight days, this dismal farce is repeated, while thepriests go among the crowd and collect money for the exhibition. Thefirst day, the blood liquefies in forty-seven minutes--the church iscrammed, then, and time must be allowed the collectors to get around:after that it liquefies a little quicker and a little quicker, every day,as the houses grow smaller, till on the eighth day, with only a fewdozens present to see the miracle, it liquefies in four minutes.
And here, also, they used to have a grand procession, of priests,citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries of the CityGovernment, once a year, to shave the head of a made-up Madonna--astuffed and painted image, like a milliner's dummy--whose hairmiraculously grew and restored itself every twelve months. They stillkept up this shaving procession as late as four or five years ago. Itwas a source of great profit to the church that possessed the remarkableeffigy, and the ceremony of the public barbering of her was alwayscarried out with the greatest possible eclat and display--the more thebetter, because the more excitement there was about it the larger thecrowds it drew and the heavier the revenues it produced--but at last aday came when the Pope and his servants were unpopular in Naples, and theCity Government stopped the Madonna's annual show.
There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans--two of the silliestpossible frauds, which half the population religiously and faithfullybelieved, and the other half either believed also or else said nothingabout, and thus lent themselves to the support of the imposture. I amvery well satisfied to think the whole population believed in those poor,cheap miracles--a people who want two cents every time they bow to you,and who abuse a woman, are capable of it, I think.
 ASCENT OF VESUVIUS--CONTINUED.
These Neapolitans always ask four times as much money as they intend totake, but if you give them what they first demand, they feel ashamed ofthemselves for aiming so low, and immediately ask more. When money is tobe paid and received, there is always some vehement jawing andgesticulating about it. One can not buy and pay for two cents' worth ofclams without trouble and a quarrel. One "course," in a two-horsecarriage, costs a franc--that is law--but the hackman always demandsmore, on some pretence or other, and if he gets it he makes a new demand.It is said that a stranger took a one-horse carriage for a course--tariff, half a franc. He gave the man five francs, by way of experiment.He demanded more, and received another franc. Again he demanded more,and got a franc--demanded more, and it was refused. He grew vehement--was again refused, and became noisy. The stranger said, "Well, give methe seven francs again, and I will see what I can do"--and when he gotthem, he handed the hackman half a franc, and he immediately asked fortwo cents to buy a drink with. It may be thought that I am prejudiced.
Perhaps I am. I would be ashamed of myself if I were not.

Well, as I was saying, we got our mules and horses, after an hour and ahalf of bargaining with the population of Annunciation, and startedsleepily up the mountain, with a vagrant at each mule's tail whopretended to be driving the brute along, but was really holding on andgetting himself dragged up instead. I made slow headway at first, but Ibegan to get dissatisfied at the idea of paying my minion five francs tohold my mule back by the tail and keep him from going up the hill, and soI discharged him. I got along faster then.
We had one magnificent picture of Naples from a high point on themountain side. We saw nothing but the gas lamps, of course--two-thirdsof a circle, skirting the great Bay--a necklace of diamonds glinting upthrough the darkness from the remote distance--less brilliant than thestars overhead, but more softly, richly beautiful--and over all the greatcity the lights crossed and recrossed each other in many and many asparkling line and curve. And back of the town, far around and abroadover the miles of level campagna, were scattered rows, and circles, andclusters of lights, all glowing like so many gems, and marking where ascore of villages were sleeping. About this time, the fellow who washanging on to the tail of the horse in front of me and practicing allsorts of unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, got kicked some fourteenrods, and this incident, together with the fairy spectacle of the lightsfar in the distance, made me serenely happy, and I was glad I started toVesuvius.
