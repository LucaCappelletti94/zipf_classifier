Few of us can stand prosperity. Another man's, I mean. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The next picture in my mind is Government House, on Malabar Point, withthe wide sea-view from the windows and broad balconies; abode of HisExcellency the Governor of the Bombay Presidency--a residence which isEuropean in everything but the native guards and servants, and is a homeand a palace of state harmoniously combined.
That was England, the English power, the English civilization, the moderncivilization--with the quiet elegancies and quiet colors and quiet tastesand quiet dignity that are the outcome of the modern cultivation. Andfollowing it came a picture of the ancient civilization of India--an hourin the mansion of a native prince: Kumar Schri Samatsinhji Bahadur of thePalitana State.
The young lad, his heir, was with the prince; also, the lad's sister, awee brown sprite, very pretty, very serious, very winning, delicatelymoulded, costumed like the daintiest butterfly, a dear little fairylandprincess, gravely willing to be friendly with the strangers, but in thebeginning preferring to hold her father's hand until she could take stockof them and determine how far they were to be trusted. She must havebeen eight years old; so in the natural (Indian) order of things shewould be a bride in three or four years from now, and then this freecontact with the sun and the air and the other belongings of out-doornature and comradeship with visiting male folk would end, and she wouldshut herself up in the zenana for life, like her mother, and by inheritedhabit of mind would be happy in that seclusion and not look upon it as anirksome restraint and a weary captivity.
The game which the prince amuses his leisure with--however, never mindit, I should never be able to describe it intelligibly. I tried to getan idea of it while my wife and daughter visited the princess in thezenana, a lady of charming graces and a fluent speaker of English, but Idid not make it out. It is a complicated game, and I believe it is saidthat nobody can learn to play it well--but an Indian. And I was not ableto learn how to wind a turban. It seemed a simple art and easy; but thatwas a deception. It is a piece of thin, delicate stuff a foot wide ormore, and forty or fifty feet long; and the exhibitor of the art takesone end of it in his hands, and winds it in and out intricately about hishead, twisting it as he goes, and in a minute or two the thing isfinished, and is neat and symmetrical and fits as snugly as a mould.
We were interested in the wardrobe and the jewels, and in the silverware,and its grace of shape and beauty and delicacy of ornamentation. Thesilverware is kept locked up, except at meal-times, and none but thechief butler and the prince have keys to the safe. I did not clearlyunderstand why, but it was not for the protection of the silver. It waseither to protect the prince from the contamination which his caste wouldsuffer if the vessels were touched by low-caste hands, or it was toprotect his highness from poison. Possibly it was both. I believe asalaried taster has to taste everything before the prince ventures it--anancient and judicious custom in the East, and has thinned out the tastersa good deal, for of course it is the cook that puts the poison in. If Iwere an Indian prince I would not go to the expense of a taster, I wouldeat with the cook.
Ceremonials are always interesting; and I noted that the Indiangood-morning is a ceremonial, whereas ours doesn't amount to that. Insalutation the son reverently touches the father's forehead with a smallsilver implement tipped with vermillion paste which leaves a red spotthere, and in return the son receives the father's blessing. Our goodmorning is well enough for the rowdy West, perhaps, but would be toobrusque for the soft and ceremonious East.
After being properly necklaced, according to custom, with great garlandsmade of yellow flowers, and provided with betel-nut to chew, thispleasant visit closed, and we passed thence to a scene of a differentsort: from this glow of color and this sunny life to those grimreceptacles of the Parsee dead, the Towers of Silence. There issomething stately about that name, and an impressiveness which sinksdeep; the hush of death is in it. We have the Grave, the Tomb, theMausoleum, God's Acre, the Cemetery; and association has made themeloquent with solemn meaning; but we have no name that is so majestic asthat one, or lingers upon the ear with such deep and haunting pathos.
On lofty ground, in the midst of a paradise of tropical foliage andflowers, remote from the world and its turmoil and noise, they stood--theTowers of Silence; and away below was spread the wide groves of cocoapalms, then the city, mile on mile, then the ocean with its fleets ofcreeping ships all steeped in a stillness as deep as the hush thathallowed this high place of the dead. The vultures were there. Theystood close together in a great circle all around the rim of a massivelow tower--waiting; stood as motionless as sculptured ornaments, andindeed almost deceived one into the belief that that was what they were.Presently there was a slight stir among the score of persons present, andall moved reverently out of the path and ceased from talking. A funeralprocession entered the great gate, marching two and two, and movedsilently by, toward the Tower. The corpse lay in a shallow shell, andwas under cover of a white cloth, but was otherwise naked. The bearersof the body were separated by an interval of thirty feet from themourners. They, and also the mourners, were draped all in pure white,and each couple of mourners was figuratively bound together by a piece ofwhite rope or a handkerchief--though they merely held the ends of it intheir hands. Behind the procession followed a dog, which was led in aleash. When the mourners had reached the neighborhood of the Tower--neither they nor any other human being but the bearers of the dead mustapproach within thirty feet of it--they turned and went back to one ofthe prayer-houses within the gates, to pray for the spirit of their dead.The bearers unlocked the Tower's sole door and disappeared from viewwithin. In a little while they came out bringing the bier and the whitecovering-cloth, and locked the door again. Then the ring of vulturesrose, flapping their wings, and swooped down into the Tower to devour thebody. Nothing was left of it but a clean-picked skeleton when theyflocked-out again a few minutes afterward.
The principle which underlies and orders everything connected with aParsee funeral is Purity. By the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion, theelements, Earth, Fire, and Water, are sacred, and must not becontaminated by contact with a dead body. Hence corpses must not beburned, neither must they be buried. None may touch the dead or enterthe Towers where they repose except certain men who are officiallyappointed for that purpose. They receive high pay, but theirs is adismal life, for they must live apart from their species, because theircommerce with the dead defiles them, and any who should associate withthem would share their defilement. When they come out of the Tower theclothes they are wearing are exchanged for others, in a building withinthe grounds, and the ones which they have taken off are left behind, forthey are contaminated, and must never be used again or suffered to gooutside the grounds. These bearers come to every funeral in newgarments. So far as is known, no human being, other than an officialcorpse-bearer--save one--has ever entered a Tower of Silence after itsconsecration. Just a hundred years ago a European rushed in behind thebearers and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbiddenmysteries of the place. This shabby savage's name is not given; hisquality is also concealed. These two details, taken in connection withthe fact that for his extraordinary offense the only punishment he gotfrom the East India Company's Government was a solemn official"reprimand"--suggest the suspicion that he was a European of consequence.The same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning thatfuture offenders of his sort, if in the Company's service, would bedismissed; and if merchants, suffer revocation of license and exile toEngland.
The Towers are not tall, but are low in proportion to theircircumference, like a gasometer. If you should fill a gasometer half wayup with solid granite masonry, then drive a wide and deep well downthrough the center of this mass of masonry, you would have the idea of aTower of Silence. On the masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie, inshallow trenches which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well. Thetrenches slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall.Underground drains, with charcoal filters in them, carry off this waterfrom the bottom of the well.
When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain and the flamingsun a month it is perfectly dry and clean. Then the same bearers thatbrought it there come gloved and take it up with tongs and throw it intothe well. There it turns to dust. It is never seen again, never touchedagain, in the world. Other peoples separate their dead, and preserve andcontinue social distinctions in the grave--the skeletons of kings andstatesmen and generals in temples and pantheons proper to skeletons oftheir degree, and the skeletons of the commonplace and the poor in placessuited to their meaner estate; but the Parsees hold that all men rankalike in death--all are humble, all poor, all destitute. In sign oftheir poverty they are sent to their grave naked, in sign of theirequality the bones of the rich, the poor, the illustrious and the obscureare flung into the common well together. At a Parsee funeral there areno vehicles; all concerned must walk, both rich and poor, howsoever greatthe distance to be traversed may be. In the wells of the Five Towers ofSilence is mingled the dust of all the Parsee men and women and childrenwho have died in Bombay and its vicinity during the two centuries whichhave elapsed since the Mohammedan conquerors drove the Parsees out ofPersia, and into that region of India. The earliest of the five towerswas built by the Modi family something more than 200 years ago, and it isnow reserved to the heirs of that house; none but the dead of that bloodare carried thither.
The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral is not nowknown--the presence of the dog. Before a corpse is borne from the houseof mourning it must be uncovered and exposed to the gaze of a dog; a dogmust also be led in the rear of the funeral. Mr. Nusserwanjee Byranijee,Secretary to the Parsee Punchayet, said that these formalities had oncehad a meaning and a reason for their institution, but that they weresurvivals whose origin none could now account for. Custom and traditioncontinue them in force, antiquity hallows them. It is thought that inancient times in Persia the dog was a sacred animal and could guide soulsto heaven; also that his eye had the power of purifying objects which hadbeen contaminated by the touch of the dead; and that hence his presencewith the funeral cortege provides an ever-applicable remedy in case ofneed.
The Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the dead is aneffective protection of the living; that it disseminates no corruption,no impurities of any sort, no disease-germs; that no wrap, no garmentwhich has touched the dead is allowed to touch the living afterward; thatfrom the Towers of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to theoutside world. These are just claims, I think. As a sanitary measure,their system seems to be about the equivalent of cremation, and as sure.We are drifting slowly--but hopefully--toward cremation in these days.It could not be expected that this progress should be swift, but if it besteady and continuous, even if slow, that will suffice. When cremationbecomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it; we should shudder atburial if we allowed ourselves to think what goes on in the grave.
The dog was an impressive figure to me, representing as he did a mysterywhose key is lost. He was humble, and apparently depressed; and he lethis head droop pensively, and looked as if he might be trying to callback to his mind what it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago whenhe began his function. There was another impressive thing close at hand,but I was not privileged to see it. That was the sacred fire--a firewhich is supposed to have been burning without interruption for more thantwo centuries; and so, living by the same heat that was imparted to it solong ago.
The Parsees are a remarkable community. There are only about 60,000 inBombay, and only about half as many as that in the rest of India; butthey make up in importance what they lack in numbers. They are highlyeducated, energetic, enterprising, progressive, rich, and the Jew himselfis not more lavish or catholic in his charities and benevolences. TheParsees build and endow hospitals, for both men and animals; and they andtheir womenkind keep an open purse for all great and good objects. Theyare a political force, and a valued support to the government. They havea pure and lofty religion, and they preserve it in its integrity andorder their lives by it.
We took a final sweep of the wonderful view of plain and city and ocean,and so ended our visit to the garden and the Towers of Silence; and thelast thing I noticed was another symbol--a voluntary symbol this one; itwas a vulture standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and slender andbranchless palm in an open space in the ground; he was perfectlymotionless, and looked like a piece of sculpture on a pillar. And he hada mortuary look, too, which was in keeping with the place.
