Note.--The assassination of the Empress of Austria atGeneva, September 10, 1898, occurred during Mark Twain's Austrianresidence. The news came to him at Kaltenleutgeben, a summerresort a little way out of Vienna. To his friend, the Rev. Jos.H. Twichell, he wrote:"That good and unoffending lady, the Empress, is killed by amadman, and I am living in the midst of world-history again. TheQueen's Jubilee last year, the invasion of the Reichsrath by thepolice, and now this murder, which will still be talked of anddescribed and painted a thousand a thousand years from now. Tohave a personal friend of the wearer of two crowns burst in atthe gate in the deep dusk of the evening and say, in a voicebroken with tears, 'My God! the Empress is murdered,' and flytoward her home before we can utter a question--why, it bringsthe giant event home to you, makes you a part of it andpersonally interested; it is as if your neighbor, Antony, shouldcome flying and say, 'Caesar is butchered--the head of the worldis fallen!'"Of course there is no talk but of this. The mourning isuniversal and genuine, the consternation is stupefying. TheAustrian Empire is being draped with black. Vienna will be aspectacle to see by next Saturday, when the funeral cort`egemarches."He was strongly moved by the tragedy, impelled to writeconcerning it. He prepared the article which follows, but didnot offer it for publication, perhaps feeling that his own closeassociation with the court circles at the moment prohibited thispersonal utterance. There appears no such reason for withholdingits publication now.A. B. P.The more one thinks of the assassination, the more imposingand tremendous the event becomes. The destruction of a city is alarge event, but it is one which repeats itself several times ina thousand years; the destruction of a third part of a nation byplague and famine is a large event, but it has happened severaltimes in history; the murder of a king is a large event, but ithas been frequent.The murder of an empress is the largest of all events. Onemust go back about two thousand years to find an instance to putwith this one. The oldest family of unchallenged descent inChristendom lives in Rome and traces its line back seventeenhundred years, but no member of it has been present in the earthwhen an empress was murdered, until now. Many a time duringthese seventeen centuries members of that family have beenstartled with the news of extraordinary events--the destructionof cities, the fall of thrones, the murder of kings, the wreck ofdynasties, the extinction of religions, the birth of new systemsof government; and their descendants have been by to hear of itand talk about it when all these things were repeated once,twice, or a dozen times--but to even that family has come news atlast which is not staled by use, has no duplicates in the longreach of its memory.It is an event which confers a curious distinction uponevery individual now living in the world: he has stood alive andbreathing in the presence of an event such as has not fallenwithin the experience of any traceable or untraceable ancestor ofhis for twenty centuries, and it is not likely to fall within theexperience of any descendant of his for twenty more.Time has made some great changes since the Roman days. Themurder of an empress then--even the assassination of Caesarhimself--could not electrify the world as this murder haselectrified it. For one reason, there was then not much of aworld to electrify; it was a small world, as to known bulk, andit had rather a thin population, besides; and for another reason,the news traveled so slowly that its tremendous initial thrillwasted away, week by week and month by month, on the journey, andby the time it reached the remoter regions there was but littleof it left. It was no longer a fresh event, it was a thing ofthe far past; it was not properly news, it was history. But theworld is enormous now, and prodigiously populated--that is onechange; and another is the lightning swiftness of the flight oftidings, good and bad. "The Empress is murdered!" When thoseamazing words struck upon my ear in this Austrian village lastSaturday, three hours after the disaster, I knew that it wasalready old news in London, Paris, Berlin, New York, SanFrancisco, Japan, China, Melbourne, Cape Town, Bombay, Madras,Calcutta, and that the entire globe with a single voice, wascursing the perpetrator of it. Since the telegraph first beganto stretch itself wider and wider about the earth, larger andincreasingly larger areas of the world have, as time went on,received simultaneously the shock of a great calamity; but thisis the first time in history that the entire surface of the globehas been swept in a single instant with the thrill of so gigantican event.And who is the miracle-worker who has furnished to the worldthis spectacle? All the ironies are compacted in the answer. Heis at the bottom of the human ladder, as the accepted estimatesof degree and value go: a soiled and patched young loafer,without gifts, without talents, without education, withoutmorals, without character, without any born charm or any acquiredone that wins or beguiles or attracts; without a single grace ofmind or heart or hand that any tramp or prostitute could envyhim; an unfaithful private in the ranks, an incompetent stone-cutter, an inefficient lackey; in a word, a mangy, offensive,empty, unwashed, vulgar, gross, mephitic, timid, sneaking, humanpolecat. And it was within the privileges and powers of thissarcasm upon the human race to reach up--up--up--and strike fromits far summit in the social skies the world's accepted ideal ofGlory and Might and Splendor and Sacredness! It realizes to uswhat sorry shows and shadows we are. Without our clothes and ourpedestals we are poor things and much of a size; our dignitiesare not real, our pomps are shams. At our best and stateliest weare not suns, as we pretended, and teach, and believe, but onlycandles; and any bummer can blow us out.And now we get realized to us once more another thing whichwe often forget--or try to: that no man has a wholly undiseasedmind; that in one way or another all men are mad. Many are madfor money. When this madness is in a mild form it is harmlessand the man passes for sane; but when it develops powerfully andtakes possession of the man, it can make him cheat, rob, andkill; and when he has got his fortune and lost it again it canland him in the asylum or the suicide's coffin. Love is amadness; if thwarted it develops fast; it can grow to a frenzy ofdespair and make an otherwise sane and highly gifted prince, likeRudolph, throw away the crown of an empire and snuff out his ownlife. All the whole list of desires, predilections, aversions,ambitions, passions, cares, griefs, regrets, remorses, areincipient madness, and ready to grow, spread, and consume, whenthe occasion comes. There are no healthy minds, and nothingsaves any man but accident--the accident of not having his maladyput to the supreme test.One of the commonest forms of madness is the desire to benoticed, the pleasure derived from being noticed. Perhaps it isnot merely common, but universal. In its mildest form itdoubtless is universal. Every child is pleased at being noticed;many intolerable children put in their whole time in distressingand idiotic effort to attract the attention of visitors; boys arealways "showing off"; apparently all men and women are glad andgrateful when they find that they have done a thing which haslifted them for a moment out of obscurity and caused wonderingtalk. This common madness can develop, by nurture, into a hungerfor notoriety in one, for fame in another. It is this madnessfor being noticed and talked about which has invented kingshipand the thousand other dignities, and tricked them out withpretty and showy fineries; it has made kings pick one another'spockets, scramble for one another's crowns and estates, slaughterone another's subjects; it has raised up prize-fighters, andpoets, and villages mayors, and little and big politicians, andbig and little charity-founders, and bicycle champions, andbanditti chiefs, and frontier desperadoes, and Napoleons.Anything to get notoriety; anything to set the village, or thetownship, or the city, or the State, or the nation, or the planetshouting, "Look--there he goes--that is the man!" And in fiveminutes' time, at no cost of brain, or labor, or genius thismangy Italian tramp has beaten them all, transcended them all,outstripped them all, for in time their names will perish; but bythe friendly help of the insane newspapers and courts and kingsand historians, his is safe and live and thunder in the world alldown the ages as long as human speech shall endure! Oh, if itwere not so tragic how ludicrous it would be!She was so blameless, the Empress; and so beautiful, in mindand heart, in person and spirit; and whether with a crown uponher head or without it and nameless, a grace to the human race,and almost a justification of its creation; WOULD be, indeed, butthat the animal that struck her down re-establishes the doubt.In her character was every quality that in woman invites andengages respect, esteem, affection, and homage. Her tastes, herinstincts, and her aspirations were all high and fine and all herlife her heart and brain were busy with activities of a noblesort. She had had bitter griefs, but they did not sour herspirit, and she had had the highest honors in the world's gift,but she went her simple way unspoiled. She knew all ranks, andwon them all, and made them her friends. An English fisherman'swife said, "When a body was in trouble she didn't send her help,she brought it herself." Crowns have adorned others, but sheadorned her crowns.It was a swift celebrity the assassin achieved. And it ismarked by some curious contrasts. At noon last, Saturday therewas no one in the world who would have consideredacquaintanceship with him a thing worth claiming or mentioning;no one would have been vain of such an acquaintanceship; thehumblest honest boot-black would not have valued the fact that hehad met him or seen him at some time or other; he was sunk inabysmal obscurity, he was away beneath the notice of the bottomgrades of officialdom. Three hours later he was the one subjectof conversation in the world, the gilded generals and admiralsand governors were discussing him, all the kings and queens andemperors had put aside their other interests to talk about him.And wherever there was a man, at the summit of the world or thebottom of it, who by chance had at some time or other come acrossthat creature, he remembered it with a secret satisfaction, andMENTIONED it--for it was a distinction, now! It brings humandignity pretty low, and for a moment the thing is not quiterealizable--but it is perfectly true. If there is a king who canremember, now, that he once saw that creature in a time past, hehas let that fact out, in a more or less studiedly casual andindifferent way, some dozens of times during the past week. Fora king is merely human; the inside of him is exactly like theinside of any other person; and it is human to find satisfactionin being in a kind of personal way connected with amazing events.We are all privately vain of such a thing; we are all alike; aking is a king by accident; the reason the rest of us are notkings is merely due to another accident; we are all made out ofthe same clay, and it is a sufficient poor quality.Below the kings, these remarks are in the air these days; Iknow it well as if I were hearing them:THE COMMANDER: "He was in my army."THE GENERAL: "He was in my corps."THE COLONEL: "He was in my regiment. A brute. I rememberhim well."THE CAPTAIN: "He was in my company. A troublesomescoundrel. I remember him well."THE SERGEANT: "Did I know him? As well as I know you.Why, every morning I used to--" etc., etc.; a glad, long story,told to devouring ears.THE LANDLADY: "Many's the time he boarded with me. I canshow you his very room, and the very bed he slept in. And thecharcoal mark there on the wall--he made that. My little Johnnysaw him do it with his own eyes. Didn't you, Johnny?"It is easy to see, by the papers, that the magistrate andthe constables and the jailer treasure up the assassin's dailyremarks and doings as precious things, and as wallowing this weekin seas of blissful distinction. The interviewer, too; he triedto let on that he is not vain of his privilege of contact withthis man whom few others are allowed to gaze upon, but he ishuman, like the rest, and can no more keep his vanity corked inthan could you or I.Some think that this murder is a frenzied revolt against thecriminal militarism which is impoverishing Europe and driving thestarving poor mad. That has many crimes to answer for, but notthis one, I think. One may not attribute to this man a generousindignation against the wrongs done the poor; one may not dignifyhim with a generous impulse of any kind. When he saw hisphotograph and said, "I shall be celebrated," he laid bare theimpulse that prompted him. It was a mere hunger for notoriety.There is another confessed case of the kind which is as old ashistory--the burning of the temple of Ephesus.Among the inadequate attempts to account for theassassination we must concede high rank to the many which havedescribed it as a "peculiarly brutal crime" and then added thatit was "ordained from above." I think this verdict will not bepopular "above." If the deed was ordained from above, there isno rational way of making this prisoner even partiallyresponsible for it, and the Genevan court cannot condemn himwithout manifestly committing a crime. Logic is logic, and bydisregarding its laws even the most pious and showy theologianmay be beguiled into preferring charges which should not beventured upon except in the shelter of plenty of lightning-rods.I witnessed the funeral procession, in company with friends,from the windows of the Krantz, Vienna's sumptuous new hotel. Wecame into town in the middle of the forenoon, and I went on footfrom the station. Black flags hung down from all the houses; theaspects were Sunday-like; the crowds on the sidewalks were quietand moved slowly; very few people were smoking; many ladies woredeep mourning, gentlemen were in black as a rule; carriages werespeeding in all directions, with footmen and coachmen in blackclothes and wearing black cocked hats; the shops were closed; inmany windows were pictures of the Empress: as a beautiful youngbride of seventeen; as a serene and majestic lady with addedyears; and finally in deep black and without ornaments--thecostume she always wore after the tragic death of her son nineyears ago, for her heart broke then, and life lost almost all itsvalue for her. The people stood grouped before these pictures,and now and then one saw women and girls turn away wiping thetears from their eyes.In front of the Krantz is an open square; over the way wasthe church where the funeral services would be held. It is smalland old and severely plain, plastered outside and whitewashed orpainted, and with no ornament but a statue of a monk in a nicheover the door, and above that a small black flag. But in itscrypt lie several of the great dead of the House of Habsburg,among them Maria Theresa and Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt.Hereabouts was a Roman camp, once, and in it the Emperor MarcusAurelius died a thousand years before the first Habsburg ruledin Vienna, which was six hundred years ago and more.The little church is packed in among great modern stores andhouses, and the windows of them were full of people. Behind thevast plate-glass windows of the upper floors of the house on thecorner one glimpsed terraced masses of fine-clothed men andwomen, dim and shimmery, like people under water. Under us thesquare was noiseless, but it was full of citizens; officials infine uniforms were flitting about on errands, and in a doorstepsat a figure in the uttermost raggedness of poverty, the feetbare, the head bent humbly down; a youth of eighteen or twenty,he was, and through the field-glass one could see that he wastearing apart and munching riffraff that he had gatheredsomewhere. Blazing uniforms flashed by him, making a sparklingcontrast with his drooping ruin of moldy rags, but he took notnotice; he was not there to grieve for a nation's disaster; hehad his own cares, and deeper. From two directions two longfiles of infantry came plowing through the pack and press insilence; there was a low, crisp order and the crowd vanished, thesquare save the sidewalks was empty, the private mourner wasgone. Another order, the soldiers fell apart and enclosed thesquare in a double-ranked human fence. It was all so swift,noiseless, exact--like a beautifully ordered machine.It was noon, now. Two hours of stillness and waitingfollowed. Then carriages began to flow past and deliver the twoand three hundred court personages and high nobilities privilegedto enter the church. Then the square filled up; not withcivilians, but with army and navy officers in showy and beautifuluniforms. They filled it compactly, leaving only a narrowcarriage path in front of the church, but there was no civilianamong them. And it was better so; dull clothes would have marredthe radiant spectacle. In the jam in front of the church, on itssteps, and on the sidewalk was a bunch of uniforms which made ablazing splotch of color--intense red, gold, and white--whichdimmed the brilliancies around them; and opposite them on theother side of the path was a bunch of cascaded bright-greenplumes above pale-blue shoulders which made another splotch ofsplendor emphatic and conspicuous in its glowing surroundings.It was a sea of flashing color all about, but these two groupswere the high notes. The green plumes were worn by forty orfifty Austrian generals, the group opposite them were chieflyKnights of Malta and knights of a German order. The mass ofheads in the square were covered by gilt helmets and by militarycaps roofed with a mirror-like gaze, and the movements of thewearers caused these things to catch the sun-rays, and the effectwas fine to see--the square was like a garden of richly coloredflowers with a multitude of blinding and flashing little sunsdistributed over it.Think of it--it was by command of that Italian loafer yonderon his imperial throne in the Geneva prison that this splendidmultitude was assembled there; and the kings and emperors thatwere entering the church from a side street were there by his will.It is so strange, so unrealizable.At three o'clock the carriages were still streaming by insingle file. At three-five a cardinal arrives with hisattendants; later some bishops; then a number of archdeacons--allin striking colors that add to the show. At three-ten aprocession of priests passed along, with crucifix. Another one,presently; after an interval, two more; at three-fifty anotherone--very long, with many crosses, gold-embroidered robes, andmuch white lace; also great pictured banners, at intervals,receding into the distance.A hum of tolling bells makes itself heard, but not sharply.At three-fifty-eight a waiting interval. Presently a longprocession of gentlemen in evening dress comes in sight andapproaches until it is near to the square, then falls backagainst the wall of soldiers at the sidewalk, and the whiteshirt-fronts show like snowflakes and are very conspicuous whereso much warm color is all about.A waiting pause. At four-twelve the head of the funeralprocession comes into view at last. First, a body of cavalry,four abreast, to widen the path. Next, a great body of lancers,in blue, with gilt helmets. Next, three six-horse mourning-coaches; outriders and coachmen in black, with cocked hats andwhite wigs. Next, troops in splendid uniforms, red, gold, andwhite, exceedingly showy.Now the multitude uncover. The soldiers present arms; thereis a low rumble of drums; the sumptuous great hearse approaches,drawn at a walk by eight black horses plumed with black bunchesof nodding ostrich feathers; the coffin is borne into the church,the doors are closed.The multitude cover their heads, and the rest of theprocession moves by; first the Hungarian Guard in theirindescribably brilliant and picturesque and beautiful uniform,inherited from the ages of barbaric splendor, and after themother mounted forces, a long and showy array.Then the shining crown in the square crumbled apart, awrecked rainbow, and melted away in radiant streams, and in theturn of a wrist the three dirtiest and raggedest and cheerfulestlittle slum-girls in Austria were capering about in the spaciousvacancy. It was a day of contrasts.Twice the Empress entered Vienna in state. The first timewas in 1854, when she was a bride of seventeen, and then she rodein measureless pomp and with blare of music through a flutteringworld of gay flags and decorations, down streets walled on bothhands with a press of shouting and welcoming subjects; and thesecond time was last Wednesday, when she entered the city in hercoffin and moved down the same streets in the dead of the nightunder swaying black flags, between packed human walls again; buteverywhere was a deep stillness, now--a stillness emphasized,rather than broken, by the muffled hoofbeats of the longcavalcade over pavements cushioned with sand, and the low sobbingof gray-headed women who had witnessed the first entry forty-fouryears before, when she and they were young--and unaware!A character in Baron von Berger's recent fairy drama"Habsburg" tells about the first coming of the girlish Empress-Queen, and in his history draws a fine picture: I cannot make aclose translation of it, but will try to convey the spirit of theverses:I saw the stately pageant pass:In her high place I saw the Empress-Queen:I could not take my eyes awayFrom that fair vision, spirit-like and pure,That rose serene, sublime, and figured to my senseA noble Alp far lighted in the blue,That in the flood of morning rends its veil of cloudAnd stands a dream of glory to the gazeOf them that in the Valley toil and plod.
