The donkeys were all good, all handsome, all strong and in goodcondition, all fast and all willing to prove it. They were the best wehad found any where, and the most 'recherche'. I do not know what'recherche' is, but that is what these donkeys were, anyhow. Somewere of a soft mouse-color, and the others were white, black, andvari-colored. Some were close-shaven, all over, except that a tuft likea paint-brush was left on the end of the tail. Others were so shaven infanciful landscape garden patterns, as to mark their bodies with curvinglines, which were bounded on one side by hair and on the other by theclose plush left by the shears. They had all been newly barbered, andwere exceedingly stylish. Several of the white ones were barred likezebras with rainbow stripes of blue and red and yellow paint. Thesewere indescribably gorgeous. Dan and Jack selected from this lotbecause they brought back Italian reminiscences of the "old masters."The saddles were the high, stuffy, frog-shaped things we had known inEphesus and Smyrna. The donkey-boys were lively young Egyptian rascalswho could follow a donkey and keep him in a canter half a day withouttiring. We had plenty of spectators when we mounted, for the hotel wasfull of English people bound overland to India and officers gettingready for the African campaign against the Abyssinian King Theodorus.We were not a very large party, but as we charged through the streets ofthe great metropolis, we made noise for five hundred, and displayedactivity and created excitement in proportion. Nobody can steer adonkey, and some collided with camels, dervishes, effendis, asses,beggars and every thing else that offered to the donkeys a reasonablechance for a collision. When we turned into the broad avenue that leadsout of the city toward Old Cairo, there was plenty of room. The wallsof stately date-palms that fenced the gardens and bordered the way,threw their shadows down and made the air cool and bracing. We rose tothe spirit of the time and the race became a wild rout, a stampede, aterrific panic. I wish to live to enjoy it again.
Somewhere along this route we had a few startling exhibitions of Orientalsimplicity. A girl apparently thirteen years of age came along the greatthoroughfare dressed like Eve before the fall. We would have called herthirteen at home; but here girls who look thirteen are often not morethan nine, in reality. Occasionally we saw stark-naked men of superbbuild, bathing, and making no attempt at concealment. However, an hour'sacquaintance with this cheerful custom reconciled the pilgrims to it, andthen it ceased to occasion remark. Thus easily do even the moststartling novelties grow tame and spiritless to these sight-surfeitedwanderers.
Arrived at Old Cairo, the camp-followers took up the donkeys and tumbledthem bodily aboard a small boat with a lateen sail, and we followed andgot under way. The deck was closely packed with donkeys and men; the twosailors had to climb over and under and through the wedged mass to workthe sails, and the steersman had to crowd four or five donkeys out of theway when he wished to swing his tiller and put his helm hard-down. Butwhat were their troubles to us? We had nothing to do; nothing to do butenjoy the trip; nothing to do but shove the donkeys off our corns andlook at the charming scenery of the Nile.
On the island at our right was the machine they call the Nilometer, astone-column whose business it is to mark the rise of the river andprophecy whether it will reach only thirty-two feet and produce a famine,or whether it will properly flood the land at forty and produce plenty,or whether it will rise to forty-three and bring death and destruction toflocks and crops--but how it does all this they could not explain to usso that we could understand. On the same island is still shown the spotwhere Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in the bulrushes. Near the spot wesailed from, the Holy Family dwelt when they sojourned in Egypt tillHerod should complete his slaughter of the innocents. The same tree theyrested under when they first arrived, was there a short time ago, but theViceroy of Egypt sent it to the Empress Eugenie lately. He was just intime, otherwise our pilgrims would have had it.
The Nile at this point is muddy, swift and turbid, and does not lack agreat deal of being as wide as the Mississippi.
We scrambled up the steep bank at the shabby town of Ghizeh, mounted thedonkeys again, and scampered away. For four or five miles the route layalong a high embankment which they say is to be the bed of a railway theSultan means to build for no other reason than that when the Empress ofthe French comes to visit him she can go to the Pyramids in comfort.This is true Oriental hospitality. I am very glad it is our privilege tohave donkeys instead of cars.
At the distance of a few miles the Pyramids rising above the palms,looked very clean-cut, very grand and imposing, and very soft and filmy,as well. They swam in a rich haze that took from them all suggestions ofunfeeling stone, and made them seem only the airy nothings of a dream--structures which might blossom into tiers of vague arches, or ornatecolonnades, may be, and change and change again, into all graceful formsof architecture, while we looked, and then melt deliciously away andblend with the tremulous atmosphere.
At the end of the levee we left the mules and went in a sailboat acrossan arm of the Nile or an overflow, and landed where the sands of theGreat Sahara left their embankment, as straight as a wall, along theverge of the alluvial plain of the river. A laborious walk in theflaming sun brought us to the foot of the great Pyramid of Cheops. Itwas a fairy vision no longer. It was a corrugated, unsightly mountain ofstone. Each of its monstrous sides was a wide stairway which roseupward, step above step, narrowing as it went, till it tapered to a pointfar aloft in the air. Insect men and women--pilgrims from the QuakerCity--were creeping about its dizzy perches, and one little black swarmwere waving postage stamps from the airy summit--handkerchiefs will beunderstood.
Of course we were besieged by a rabble of muscular Egyptians and Arabswho wanted the contract of dragging us to the top--all tourists are. Ofcourse you could not hear your own voice for the din that was around you.Of course the Sheiks said they were the only responsible parties; thatall contracts must be made with them, all moneys paid over to them, andnone exacted from us by any but themselves alone. Of course theycontracted that the varlets who dragged us up should not mentionbucksheesh once. For such is the usual routine. Of course we contractedwith them, paid them, were delivered into the hands of the draggers,dragged up the Pyramids, and harried and be-deviled for bucksheesh fromthe foundation clear to the summit. We paid it, too, for we werepurposely spread very far apart over the vast side of the Pyramid. Therewas no help near if we called, and the Herculeses who dragged us had away of asking sweetly and flatteringly for bucksheesh, which wasseductive, and of looking fierce and threatening to throw us down theprecipice, which was persuasive and convincing.
Each step being full as high as a dinner-table; there being very, verymany of the steps; an Arab having hold of each of our arms and springingupward from step to step and snatching us with them, forcing us to liftour feet as high as our breasts every time, and do it rapidly and keep itup till we were ready to faint, who shall say it is not lively,exhilarating, lacerating, muscle-straining, bone-wrenching and perfectlyexcruciating and exhausting pastime, climbing the Pyramids? I beseechedthe varlets not to twist all my joints asunder; I iterated, reiterated,even swore to them that I did not wish to beat any body to the top; didall I could to convince them that if I got there the last of all I wouldfeel blessed above men and grateful to them forever; I begged them,prayed them, pleaded with them to let me stop and rest a moment--only onelittle moment: and they only answered with some more frightful springs,and an unenlisted volunteer behind opened a bombardment of determinedboosts with his head which threatened to batter my whole politicaleconomy to wreck and ruin.
Twice, for one minute, they let me rest while they extorted bucksheesh,and then continued their maniac flight up the Pyramid. They wished tobeat the other parties. It was nothing to them that I, a stranger, mustbe sacrificed upon the altar of their unholy ambition. But in the midstof sorrow, joy blooms. Even in this dark hour I had a sweet consolation.For I knew that except these Mohammedans repented they would go straightto perdition some day. And they never repent--they never forsake theirpaganism. This thought calmed me, cheered me, and I sank down, limp andexhausted, upon the summit, but happy, so happy and serene within.
On the one hand, a mighty sea of yellow sand stretched away toward theends of the earth, solemn, silent, shorn of vegetation, its solitudeuncheered by any forms of creature life; on the other, the Eden of Egyptwas spread below us--a broad green floor, cloven by the sinuous river,dotted with villages, its vast distances measured and marked by thediminishing stature of receding clusters of palms. It lay asleep in anenchanted atmosphere. There was no sound, no motion. Above thedate-plumes in the middle distance, swelled a domed and pinnacled mass,glimmering through a tinted, exquisite mist; away toward the horizon adozen shapely pyramids watched over ruined Memphis: and at our feet thebland impassible Sphynx looked out upon the picture from her throne inthe sands as placidly and pensively as she had looked upon its like fullfifty lagging centuries ago.
We suffered torture no pen can describe from the hungry appeals forbucksheesh that gleamed from Arab eyes and poured incessantly from Arablips. Why try to call up the traditions of vanished Egyptian grandeur;why try to fancy Egypt following dead Rameses to his tomb in the Pyramid,or the long multitude of Israel departing over the desert yonder? Whytry to think at all? The thing was impossible. One must bring hismeditations cut and dried, or else cut and dry them afterward.
The traditional Arab proposed, in the traditional way, to run downCheops, cross the eighth of a mile of sand intervening between it and thetall pyramid of Cephron, ascend to Cephron's summit and return to us onthe top of Cheops--all in nine minutes by the watch, and the wholeservice to be rendered for a single dollar. In the first flush ofirritation, I said let the Arab and his exploits go to the mischief.But stay. The upper third of Cephron was coated with dressed marble,smooth as glass. A blessed thought entered my brain. He must infalliblybreak his neck. Close the contract with dispatch, I said, and let himgo. He started. We watched. He went bounding down the vast broadside,spring after spring, like an ibex. He grew small and smaller till hebecame a bobbing pigmy, away down toward the bottom--then disappeared.We turned and peered over the other side--forty seconds--eighty seconds--a hundred--happiness, he is dead already!--two minutes--and a quarter--"There he goes!" Too true--it was too true. He was very small, now.Gradually, but surely, he overcame the level ground. He began to springand climb again. Up, up, up--at last he reached the smooth coating--nowfor it. But he clung to it with toes and fingers, like a fly. Hecrawled this way and that--away to the right, slanting upward--away tothe left, still slanting upward--and stood at last, a black peg on thesummit, and waved his pigmy scarf! Then he crept downward to the rawsteps again, then picked up his agile heels and flew. We lost himpresently. But presently again we saw him under us, mounting withundiminished energy. Shortly he bounded into our midst with a gallantwar-whoop. Time, eight minutes, forty-one seconds. He had won. Hisbones were intact. It was a failure. I reflected. I said to myself, heis tired, and must grow dizzy. I will risk another dollar on him.
He started again. Made the trip again. Slipped on the smooth coating--I almost had him. But an infamous crevice saved him. He was with usonce more--perfectly sound. Time, eight minutes, forty-six seconds.
I said to Dan, "Lend me a dollar--I can beat this game, yet."
Worse and worse. He won again. Time, eight minutes, forty-eightseconds. I was out of all patience, now. I was desperate.--Money wasno longer of any consequence. I said, "Sirrah, I will give you a hundreddollars to jump off this pyramid head first. If you do not like theterms, name your bet. I scorn to stand on expenses now. I will stayright here and risk money on you as long as Dan has got a cent."
I was in a fair way to win, now, for it was a dazzling opportunity for anArab. He pondered a moment, and would have done it, I think, but hismother arrived, then, and interfered. Her tears moved me--I never canlook upon the tears of woman with indifference--and I said I would giveher a hundred to jump off, too.
But it was a failure. The Arabs are too high-priced in Egypt. They puton airs unbecoming to such savages.
We descended, hot and out of humor. The dragoman lit candles, and we allentered a hole near the base of the pyramid, attended by a crazy rabbleof Arabs who thrust their services upon us uninvited. They dragged us upa long inclined chute, and dripped candle-grease all over us. This chutewas not more than twice as wide and high as a Saratoga trunk, and waswalled, roofed and floored with solid blocks of Egyptian granite as wideas a wardrobe, twice as thick and three times as long. We kept onclimbing, through the oppressive gloom, till I thought we ought to benearing the top of the pyramid again, and then came to the "Queen'sChamber," and shortly to the Chamber of the King. These large apartmentswere tombs. The walls were built of monstrous masses of smoothedgranite, neatly joined together. Some of them were nearly as largesquare as an ordinary parlor. A great stone sarcophagus like a bath-tubstood in the centre of the King's Chamber. Around it were gathered apicturesque group of Arab savages and soiled and tattered pilgrims, whoheld their candles aloft in the gloom while they chattered, and thewinking blurs of light shed a dim glory down upon one of theirrepressible memento-seekers who was pecking at the venerablesarcophagus with his sacrilegious hammer.
We struggled out to the open air and the bright sunshine, and for thespace of thirty minutes received ragged Arabs by couples, dozens andplatoons, and paid them bucksheesh for services they swore and proved byeach other that they had rendered, but which we had not been aware ofbefore--and as each party was paid, they dropped into the rear of theprocession and in due time arrived again with a newly-invented delinquentlist for liquidation.
We lunched in the shade of the pyramid, and in the midst of thisencroaching and unwelcome company, and then Dan and Jack and I startedaway for a walk. A howling swarm of beggars followed us--surrounded us--almost headed us off. A sheik, in flowing white bournous and gaudyhead-gear, was with them. He wanted more bucksheesh. But we hadadopted a new code--it was millions for defense, but not a cent forbucksheesh. I asked him if he could persuade the others to depart if wepaid him. He said yes--for ten francs. We accepted the contract, andsaid--
"Now persuade your vassals to fall back."
He swung his long staff round his head and three Arabs bit the dust. Hecapered among the mob like a very maniac. His blows fell like hail, andwherever one fell a subject went down. We had to hurry to the rescue andtell him it was only necessary to damage them a little, he need not killthem.--In two minutes we were alone with the sheik, and remained so.The persuasive powers of this illiterate savage were remarkable.
Each side of the Pyramid of Cheops is about as long as the Capitol atWashington, or the Sultan's new palace on the Bosporus, and is longerthan the greatest depth of St. Peter's at Rome--which is to say that eachside of Cheops extends seven hundred and some odd feet. It is aboutseventy-five feet higher than the cross on St. Peter's. The first time Iever went down the Mississippi, I thought the highest bluff on the riverbetween St. Louis and New Orleans--it was near Selma, Missouri--wasprobably the highest mountain in the world. It is four hundred andthirteen feet high. It still looms in my memory with undiminishedgrandeur. I can still see the trees and bushes growing smaller andsmaller as I followed them up its huge slant with my eye, till theybecame a feathery fringe on the distant summit. This symmetrical Pyramidof Cheops--this solid mountain of stone reared by the patient hands ofmen--this mighty tomb of a forgotten monarch--dwarfs my cherishedmountain. For it is four hundred and eighty feet high. In still earlieryears than those I have been recalling, Holliday's Hill, in our town, wasto me the noblest work of God. It appeared to pierce the skies. It wasnearly three hundred feet high. In those days I pondered the subjectmuch, but I never could understand why it did not swathe its summit withnever-failing clouds, and crown its majestic brow with everlasting snows.I had heard that such was the custom of great mountains in other parts ofthe world. I remembered how I worked with another boy, at odd afternoonsstolen from study and paid for with stripes, to undermine and start fromits bed an immense boulder that rested upon the edge of that hilltop; Iremembered how, one Saturday afternoon, we gave three hours of honesteffort to the task, and saw at last that our reward was at hand; Iremembered how we sat down, then, and wiped the perspiration away, andwaited to let a picnic party get out of the way in the road below--andthen we started the boulder. It was splendid. It went crashing down thehillside, tearing up saplings, mowing bushes down like grass, ripping andcrushing and smashing every thing in its path--eternally splintered andscattered a wood pile at the foot of the hill, and then sprang from thehigh bank clear over a dray in the road--the negro glanced up once anddodged--and the next second it made infinitesimal mince-meat of a framecooper-shop, and the coopers swarmed out like bees. Then we said it wasperfectly magnificent, and left. Because the coopers were starting upthe hill to inquire.
Still, that mountain, prodigious as it was, was nothing to the Pyramid ofCheops. I could conjure up no comparison that would convey to my mind asatisfactory comprehension of the magnitude of a pile of monstrous stonesthat covered thirteen acres of ground and stretched upward four hundredand eighty tiresome feet, and so I gave it up and walked down to theSphynx.
After years of waiting, it was before me at last. The great face was sosad, so earnest, so longing, so patient. There was a dignity not ofearth in its mien, and in its countenance a benignity such as never anything human wore. It was stone, but it seemed sentient. If ever imageof stone thought, it was thinking. It was looking toward the verge ofthe landscape, yet looking at nothing--nothing but distance and vacancy.It was looking over and beyond every thing of the present, and far intothe past. It was gazing out over the ocean of Time--over lines ofcentury-waves which, further and further receding, closed nearer andnearer together, and blended at last into one unbroken tide, away towardthe horizon of remote antiquity. It was thinking of the wars of departedages; of the empires it had seen created and destroyed; of the nationswhose birth it had witnessed, whose progress it had watched, whoseannihilation it had noted; of the joy and sorrow, the life and death, thegrandeur and decay, of five thousand slow revolving years. It was thetype of an attribute of man--of a faculty of his heart and brain. It wasMEMORY--RETROSPECTION--wrought into visible, tangible form. All who knowwhat pathos there is in memories of days that are accomplished and facesthat have vanished--albeit only a trifling score of years gone by--willhave some appreciation of the pathos that dwells in these grave eyes thatlook so steadfastly back upon the things they knew before History wasborn--before Tradition had being--things that were, and forms that moved,in a vague era which even Poetry and Romance scarce know of--and passedone by one away and left the stony dreamer solitary in the midst of astrange new age, and uncomprehended scenes.
The Sphynx is grand in its loneliness; it is imposing in its magnitude;it is impressive in the mystery that hangs over its story. And there isthat in the overshadowing majesty of this eternal figure of stone, withits accusing memory of the deeds of all ages, which reveals to onesomething of what he shall feel when he shall stand at last in the awfulpresence of God.
There are some things which, for the credit of America, should be leftunsaid, perhaps; but these very things happen sometimes to be the verythings which, for the real benefit of Americans, ought to have prominentnotice. While we stood looking, a wart, or an excrescence of some kind,appeared on the jaw of the Sphynx. We heard the familiar clink of ahammer, and understood the case at once. One of our well meaningreptiles--I mean relic-hunters--had crawled up there and was trying tobreak a "specimen" from the face of this the most majestic creation thehand of man has wrought. But the great image contemplated the dead agesas calmly as ever, unconscious of the small insect that was fretting atits jaw. Egyptian granite that has defied the storms and earthquakes ofall time has nothing to fear from the tack-hammers of ignorantexcursionists--highwaymen like this specimen. He failed in hisenterprise. We sent a sheik to arrest him if he had the authority, or towarn him, if he had not, that by the laws of Egypt the crime he wasattempting to commit was punishable with imprisonment or the bastinado.Then he desisted and went away.
The Sphynx: a hundred and twenty-five feet long, sixty feet high, and ahundred and two feet around the head, if I remember rightly--carved outof one solid block of stone harder than any iron. The block must havebeen as large as the Fifth Avenue Hotel before the usual waste (by thenecessities of sculpture) of a fourth or a half of the original mass wasbegun. I only set down these figures and these remarks to suggest theprodigious labor the carving of it so elegantly, so symmetrically, sofaultlessly, must have cost. This species of stone is so hard thatfigures cut in it remain sharp and unmarred after exposure to the weatherfor two or three thousand years. Now did it take a hundred years ofpatient toil to carve the Sphynx? It seems probable.
Something interfered, and we did not visit the Red Sea and walk upon thesands of Arabia. I shall not describe the great mosque of Mehemet Ali,whose entire inner walls are built of polished and glistening alabaster;I shall not tell how the little birds have built their nests in theglobes of the great chandeliers that hang in the mosque, and how theyfill the whole place with their music and are not afraid of any bodybecause their audacity is pardoned, their rights are respected, andnobody is allowed to interfere with them, even though the mosque be thusdoomed to go unlighted; I certainly shall not tell the hackneyed story ofthe massacre of the Mamelukes, because I am glad the lawless rascals weremassacred, and I do not wish to get up any sympathy in their behalf; Ishall not tell how that one solitary Mameluke jumped his horse a hundredfeet down from the battlements of the citadel and escaped, because I donot think much of that--I could have done it myself; I shall not tell ofJoseph's well which he dug in the solid rock of the citadel hill andwhich is still as good as new, nor how the same mules he bought to drawup the water (with an endless chain) are still at it yet and are gettingtired of it, too; I shall not tell about Joseph's granaries which hebuilt to store the grain in, what time the Egyptian brokers were "sellingshort," unwitting that there would be no corn in all the land when itshould be time for them to deliver; I shall not tell any thing about thestrange, strange city of Cairo, because it is only a repetition, a gooddeal intensified and exaggerated, of the Oriental cities I have alreadyspoken of; I shall not tell of the Great Caravan which leaves for Meccaevery year, for I did not see it; nor of the fashion the people have ofprostrating themselves and so forming a long human pavement to be riddenover by the chief of the expedition on its return, to the end that theirsalvation may be thus secured, for I did not see that either; I shall notspeak of the railway, for it is like any other railway--I shall only saythat the fuel they use for the locomotive is composed of mummies threethousand years old, purchased by the ton or by the graveyard for thatpurpose, and that sometimes one hears the profane engineer call outpettishly, "D--n these plebeians, they don't burn worth a cent--pass outa King;"--[Stated to me for a fact. I only tell it as I got it. I amwilling to believe it. I can believe any thing.]--I shall not tell ofthe groups of mud cones stuck like wasps' nests upon a thousand moundsabove high water-mark the length and breadth of Egypt--villages of thelower classes; I shall not speak of the boundless sweep of level plain,green with luxuriant grain, that gladdens the eye as far as it can piercethrough the soft, rich atmosphere of Egypt; I shall not speak of thevision of the Pyramids seen at a distance of five and twenty miles, forthe picture is too ethereal to be limned by an uninspired pen; I shallnot tell of the crowds of dusky women who flocked to the cars when theystopped a moment at a station, to sell us a drink of water or a ruddy,juicy pomegranate; I shall not tell of the motley multitudes and wildcostumes that graced a fair we found in full blast at another barbarousstation; I shall not tell how we feasted on fresh dates and enjoyed thepleasant landscape all through the flying journey; nor how we thunderedinto Alexandria, at last, swarmed out of the cars, rowed aboard the ship,left a comrade behind, (who was to return to Europe, thence home,) raisedthe anchor, and turned our bows homeward finally and forever from thelong voyage; nor how, as the mellow sun went down upon the oldest land onearth, Jack and Moult assembled in solemn state in the smoking-room andmourned over the lost comrade the whole night long, and would not becomforted. I shall not speak a word of any of these things, or write aline. They shall be as a sealed book. I do not know what a sealed bookis, because I never saw one, but a sealed book is the expression to usein this connection, because it is popular.
We were glad to have seen the land which was the mother of civilization--which taught Greece her letters, and through Greece Rome, and throughRome the world; the land which could have humanized and civilized thehapless children of Israel, but allowed them to depart out of her borderslittle better than savages. We were glad to have seen that land whichhad an enlightened religion with future eternal rewards and punishment init, while even Israel's religion contained no promise of a hereafter.We were glad to have seen that land which had glass three thousand yearsbefore England had it, and could paint upon it as none of us can paintnow; that land which knew, three thousand years ago, well nigh all ofmedicine and surgery which science has discovered lately; which had allthose curious surgical instruments which science has invented recently;which had in high excellence a thousand luxuries and necessities of anadvanced civilization which we have gradually contrived and accumulatedin modern times and claimed as things that were new under the sun; thathad paper untold centuries before we dreampt of it--and waterfalls beforeour women thought of them; that had a perfect system of common schools solong before we boasted of our achievements in that direction that itseems forever and forever ago; that so embalmed the dead that flesh wasmade almost immortal--which we can not do; that built temples which mockat destroying time and smile grimly upon our lauded little prodigies ofarchitecture; that old land that knew all which we know now, perchance,and more; that walked in the broad highway of civilization in the graydawn of creation, ages and ages before we were born; that left theimpress of exalted, cultivated Mind upon the eternal front of the Sphynxto confound all scoffers who, when all her other proofs had passed away,might seek to persuade the world that imperial Egypt, in the days of herhigh renown, had groped in darkness.
