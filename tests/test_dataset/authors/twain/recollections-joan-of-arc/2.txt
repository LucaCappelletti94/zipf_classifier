The Fairy Tree of Domremy
OUR DOMREMY was like any other humble little hamlet of that remote timeand region. It was a maze of crooked, narrow lanes and alleys shaded andsheltered by the overhanging thatch roofs of the barnlike houses. Thehouses were dimly lighted by wooden-shuttered windows--that is, holesin the walls which served for windows. The floors were dirt, and therewas very little furniture. Sheep and cattle grazing was the mainindustry; all the young folks tended flocks.
The situation was beautiful. From one edge of the village a floweryplain extended in a wide sweep to the river--the Meuse; from the rearedge of the village a grassy slope rose gradually, and at the top wasthe great oak forest--a forest that was deep and gloomy and dense, andfull of interest for us children, for many murders had been done in itby outlaws in old times, and in still earlier times prodigious dragonsthat spouted fire and poisonous vapors from their nostrils had theirhomes in there. In fact, one was still living in there in our own time.It was as long as a tree, and had a body as big around as a tierce, andscales like overlapping great tiles, and deep ruby eyes as large as acavalier's hat, and an anchor-fluke on its tail as big as I don't knowwhat, but very big, even unusually so for a dragon, as everybody saidwho knew about dragons. It was thought that this dragon was of abrilliant blue color, with gold mottlings, but no one had ever seen it,therefore this was not known to be so, it was only an opinion. It wasnot my opinion; I think there is no sense in forming an opinion whenthere is no evidence to form it on. If you build a person without anybones in him he may look fair enough to the eye, but he will be limberand cannot stand up; and I consider that evidence is the bones of anopinion. But I will take up this matter more at large at another time,and try to make the justness of my position appear. As to that dragon, Ialways held the belief that its color was gold and without blue, forthat has always been the color of dragons. That this dragon lay but alittle way within the wood at one time is shown by the fact that PierreMorel was in there one day and smelt it, and recognized it by the smell.It gives one a horrid idea of how near to us the deadliest danger can beand we not suspect it.
In the earliest times a hundred knights from many remote places in theearth would have gone in there one after another, to kill the dragon andget the reward, but in our time that method had gone out, and the priesthad become the one that abolished dragons. Pere Guillaume Fronte did itin this case. He had a procession, with candles and incense and banners,and marched around the edge of the wood and exorcised the dragon, and itwas never heard of again, although it was the opinion of many that thesmell never wholly passed away. Not that any had ever smelt the smellagain, for none had; it was only an opinion, like that other--and lackedbones, you see. I know that the creature was there before the exorcism,but whether it was there afterward or not is a thing which I cannot beso positive about.
In a noble open space carpeted with grass on the high ground towardVaucouleurs stood a most majestic beech tree with wide-reaching arms anda grand spread of shade, and by it a limpid spring of cold water; and onsummer days the children went there--oh, every summer for more than fivehundred years--went there and sang and danced around the tree for hourstogether, refreshing themselves at the spring from time to time, and itwas most lovely and enjoyable. Also they made wreaths of flowers andhung them upon the tree and about the spring to please the fairies thatlived there; for they liked that, being idle innocent little creatures,as all fairies are, and fond of anything delicate and pretty like wildflowers put together in that way. And in return for this attention thefairies did any friendly thing they could for the children, such askeeping the spring always full and clear and cold, and driving awayserpents and insects that sting; and so there was never any unkindnessbetween the fairies and the children during more than five hundredyears--tradition said a thousand--but only the warmest affection and themost perfect trust and confidence; and whenever a child died the fairiesmourned just as that child's playmates did, and the sign of it was thereto see; for before the dawn on the day of the funeral they hung a littleimmortelle over the place where that child was used to sit under thetree. I know this to be true by my own eyes; it is not hearsay. And thereason it was known that the fairies did it was this--that it was madeall of black flowers of a sort not known in France anywhere.
Now from time immemorial all children reared in Domremy were called theChildren of the Tree; and they loved that name, for it carried with it amystic privilege not granted to any others of the children of thisworld. Which was this: whenever one of these came to die, then beyondthe vague and formless images drifting through his darkening mind rosesoft and rich and fair a vision of the Tree--if all was well with hissoul. That was what some said. Others said the vision came in two ways:once as a warning, one or two years in advance of death, when the soulwas the captive of sin, and then the Tree appeared in its desolatewinter aspect--then that soul was smitten with an awful fear. Ifrepentance came, and purity of life, the vision came again, this timesummer-clad and beautiful; but if it were otherwise with that soul thevision was withheld, and it passed from life knowing its doom. Stillothers said that the vision came but once, and then only to the sinlessdying forlorn in distant lands and pitifully longing for some last dearreminder of their home. And what reminder of it could go to their heartslike the picture of the Tree that was the darling of their love and thecomrade of their joys and comforter of their small griefs all throughthe divine days of their vanished youth?
Now the several traditions were as I have said, some believing one andsome another. One of them I knew to be the truth, and that was the lastone. I do not say anything against the others; I think they were true,but I only know that the last one was; and it is my thought that if onekeep to the things he knows, and not trouble about the things which hecannot be sure about, he will have the steadier mind for it--and thereis profit in that. I know that when the Children of the Tree die in afar land, then--if they be at peace with God--they turn their longingeyes toward home, and there, far-shining, as through a rift in a cloudthat curtains heaven, they see the soft picture of the Fairy Tree,clothed in a dream of golden light; and they see the bloomy mead slopingaway to the river, and to their perishing nostrils is blown faint andsweet the fragrance of the flowers of home. And then the vision fadesand passes--but they know, they know! and by their transfigured faces youknow also, you who stand looking on; yes, you know the message that hascome, and that it has come from heaven.
Joan and I believed alike about this matter. But Pierre Morel andJacques d'Arc, and many others believed that the vision appeared twice--to a sinner. In fact, they and many others said they knew it. Probablybecause their fathers had known it and had told them; for one gets mostthings at second hand in this world.
Now one thing that does make it quite likely that there were really twoapparitions of the Tree is this fact: From the most ancient times if onesaw a villager of ours with his face ash-white and rigid with a ghastlyfright, it was common for every one to whisper to his neighbor, "Ah, heis in sin, and has got his warning." And the neighbor would shudder atthe thought and whisper back, "Yes, poor soul, he has seen the Tree."
Such evidences as these have their weight; they are not to be put asidewith a wave of the hand. A thing that is backed by the cumulativeevidence of centuries naturally gets nearer and nearer to being proofall the time; and if this continue and continue, it will some day becomeauthority--and authority is a bedded rock, and will abide.
In my long life I have seen several cases where the tree appearedannouncing a death which was still far away; but in none of these wasthe person in a state of sin. No; the apparition was in these cases onlya special grace; in place of deferring the tidings of that soul'sredemption till the day of death, the apparition brought them longbefore, and with them peace--peace that might no more be disturbed--theeternal peace of God. I myself, old and broken, wait with serenity; forI have seen the vision of the Tree. I have seen it, and am content.
Always, from the remotest times, when the children joined hands anddanced around the Fairy Tree they sang a song which was the Tree's song,the song of L'Arbre fee de Bourlemont. They sang it to a quaint sweetair--a solacing sweet air which has gone murmuring through my dreamingspirit all my life when I was weary and troubled, resting me andcarrying me through night and distance home again. No stranger can knowor feel what that song has been, through the drifting centuries, toexiled Children of the Tree, homeless and heavy of heart in countriesforeign to their speech and ways. You will think it a simple thing, thatsong, and poor, perchance; but if you will remember what it was to us,and what it brought before our eyes when it floated through ourmemories, then you will respect it. And you will understand how thewater wells up in our eyes and makes all things dim, and our voicesbreak and we cannot sing the last lines:
"And when, in Exile wand'ring, we Shall fainting yearn for glimpse ofthee, Oh, rise upon our sight!"
And you will remember that Joan of Arc sang this song with us around theTree when she was a little child, and always loved it. And that hallowsit, yes, you will grant that:
 L'ARBRE FEE DE BOURLEMONT
 SONG OF THE CHILDREN
 Now what has kept your leaves so green, Arbre Fee de Bourlemont?
 The children's tears! They brought each grief, And you did comfort them and cheer Their bruised hearts, and steal a tear That, healed, rose a leaf.
 And what has built you up so strong, Arbre Fee de Bourlemont?
 The children's love! They've loved you long Ten hundred years, in sooth, They've nourished you with praise and song, And warmed your heart and kept it young-- A thousand years of youth!
 Bide always green in our young hearts, Arbre Fee de Bourlemont! And we shall always youthful be, Not heeding Time his flight; And when, in exile wand'ring, we Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee, Oh, rise upon our sight!
The fairies were still there when we were children, but we never sawthem; because, a hundred years before that, the priest of Domremy hadheld a religious function under the tree and denounced them as beingblood-kin to the Fiend and barred them from redemption; and then hewarned them never to show themselves again, nor hang any moreimmortelles, on pain of perpetual banishment from that parish.
All the children pleaded for the fairies, and said they were their goodfriends and dear to them and never did them any harm, but the priestwould not listen, and said it was sin and shame to have such friends. Thechildren mourned and could not be comforted; and they made an agreementamong themselves that they would always continue to hang flower-wreathson the tree as a perpetual sign to the fairies that they were still lovedand remembered, though lost to sight.
But late one night a great misfortune befell. Edmond Aubrey's motherpassed by the Tree, and the fairies were stealing a dance, not thinkinganybody was by; and they were so busy, and so intoxicated with the wildhappiness of it, and with the bumpers of dew sharpened up with honeywhich they had been drinking, that they noticed nothing; so Dame Aubreystood there astonished and admiring, and saw the little fantastic atomsholding hands, as many as three hundred of them, tearing around in agreat ring half as big as an ordinary bedroom, and leaning away back andspreading their mouths with laughter and song, which she could hear quitedistinctly, and kicking their legs up as much as three inches from theground in perfect abandon and hilarity--oh, the very maddest andwitchingest dance the woman ever saw.
But in about a minute or two minutes the poor little ruined creaturesdiscovered her. They burst out in one heartbreaking squeak of grief andterror and fled every which way, with their wee hazel-nut fists in theireyes and crying; and so disappeared.
The heartless woman--no, the foolish woman; she was not heartless, butonly thoughtless--went straight home and told the neighbors all about it,whilst we, the small friends of the fairies, were asleep and not wittingthe calamity that was come upon us, and all unconscious that we ought tobe up and trying to stop these fatal tongues. In the morning everybodyknew, and the disaster was complete, for where everybody knows a thingthe priest knows it, of course. We all flocked to Pere Fronte, crying andbegging--and he had to cry, too, seeing our sorrow, for he had a mostkind and gentle nature; and he did not want to banish the fairies, andsaid so; but said he had no choice, for it had been decreed that if theyever revealed themselves to man again, they must go. This all happened atthe worst time possible, for Joan of Arc was ill of a fever and out ofher head, and what could we do who had not her gifts of reasoning andpersuasion? We flew in a swarm to her bed and cried out, "Joan, wake!Wake, there is no moment to lose! Come and plead for the fairies--comeand save them; only you can do it!"
But her mind was wandering, she did not know what we said nor what wemeant; so we went away knowing all was lost. Yes, all was lost, foreverlost; the faithful friends of the children for five hundred years mustgo, and never come back any more.
It was a bitter day for us, that day that Pere Fronte held the functionunder the tree and banished the fairies. We could not wear mourning thatany could have noticed, it would not have been allowed; so we had to becontent with some poor small rag of black tied upon our garments where itmade no show; but in our hearts we wore mourning, big and noble andoccupying all the room, for our hearts were ours; they could not get atthem to prevent that.
The great tree--l'Arbre Fee do Bourlemont was its beautiful name--wasnever afterward quite as much to us as it had been before, but it wasalways dear; is dear to me yet when I got there now, once a year in myold age, to sit under it and bring back the lost playmates of my youthand group them about me and look upon their faces through my tears andbreak my heart, oh, my God! No, the place was not quite the sameafterward. In one or two ways it could not be; for, the fairies'protection being gone, the spring lost much of its freshness andcoldness, and more than two-thirds of its volume, and the banishedserpents and stinging insects returned, and multiplied, and became atorment and have remained so to this day.
When that wise little child, Joan, got well, we realized how much herillness had cost us; for we found that we had been right in believing shecould save the fairies. She burst into a great storm of anger, for solittle a creature, and went straight to Pere Fronte, and stood up beforehim where he sat, and made reverence and said:
"The fairies were to go if they showed themselves to people again, is itnot so?"
"Yes, that was it, dear."
"If a man comes prying into a person's room at midnight when that personis half-naked, will you be so unjust as to say that that person isshowing himself to that man?"
"Well--no." The good priest looked a little troubled and uneasy when hesaid it.
"Is a sin a sin, anyway, even if one did not intend to commit it?"
Pere Fronte threw up his hands and cried out:
"Oh, my poor little child, I see all my fault," and he drew here to hisside and put an arm around her and tried to make his peace with her, buther temper was up so high that she could not get it down right away, butburied her head against his breast and broke out crying and said:
"Then the fairies committed no sin, for there was no intention to commitone, they not knowing that any one was by; and because they were littlecreatures and could not speak for themselves and say the saw was againstthe intention, not against the innocent act, because they had no friendto think that simple thing for them and say it, they have been sent awayfrom their home forever, and it was wrong, wrong to do it!"
The good father hugged her yet closer to his side and said:
"Oh, out of the mouths of babes and sucklings the heedless and unthinkingare condemned; would God I could bring the little creatures back, foryour sake. And mine, yes, and mine; for I have been unjust. There, there,don't cry--nobody could be sorrier than your poor old friend--don't cry,dear."
"But I can't stop right away, I've got to. And it is no little matter,this thing that you have done. Is being sorry penance enough for such anact?"
Pere Fronte turned away his face, for it would have hurt her to see himlaugh, and said:
"Oh, thou remorseless but most just accuser, no, it is not. I will put onsackcloth and ashes; there--are you satisfied?"
Joan's sobs began to diminish, and she presently looked up at the old manthrough her tears, and said, in her simple way:
"Yes, that will do--if it will clear you."
Pere Fronte would have been moved to laugh again, perhaps, if he had notremembered in time that he had made a contract, and not a very agreeableone. It must be fulfilled. So he got up and went to the fireplace, Joanwatching him with deep interest, and took a shovelful of cold ashes, andwas going to empty them on his old gray head when a better idea came tohim, and he said:
"Would you mind helping me, dear?"
"How, father?"
He got down on his knees and bent his head low, and said:
"Take the ashes and put them on my head for me."
The matter ended there, of course. The victory was with the priest. Onecan imagine how the idea of such a profanation would strike Joan or anyother child in the village. She ran and dropped upon her knees by hisside and said:
"Oh, it is dreadful. I didn't know that that was what one meant bysackcloth and ashes--do please get up, father."
"But I can't until I am forgiven. Do you forgive me?"
"I? Oh, you have done nothing to me, father; it is yourself that mustforgive yourself for wronging those poor things. Please get up, gather,won't you?"
"But I am worse off now than I was before. I thought I was earning yourforgiveness, but if it is my own, I can't be lenient; it would not becomeme. Now what can I do? Find me some way out of this with your wise littlehead."
The Pere would not stir, for all Joan's pleadings. She was about to cryagain; then she had an idea, and seized the shovel and deluged her ownhead with the ashes, stammering out through her chokings andsuffocations:
"There--now it is done. Oh, please get up, father."
The old man, both touched and amused, gathered her to his breast andsaid:
"Oh, you incomparable child! It's a humble martyrdom, and not of a sortpresentable in a picture, but the right and true spirit is in it; that Itestify."
Then he brushed the ashes out of her hair, and helped her scour her faceand neck and properly tidy herself up. He was in fine spirits now, andready for further argument, so he took his seat and drew Joan to his sideagain, and said:
"Joan, you were used to make wreaths there at the Fairy Tree with theother children; is it not so?"
That was the way he always started out when he was going to corner me upand catch me in something--just that gentle, indifferent way that fools aperson so, and leads him into the trap, he never noticing which way he istraveling until he is in and the door shut on him. He enjoyed that. Iknew he was going to drop corn along in front of Joan now. Joan answered:
"Yes, father."
"Did you hang them on the tree?"
"No, father."
"Didn't hang them there?"
"No."
"Why didn't you?"
"I--well, I didn't wish to."
"Didn't wish to?"
"No, father."
"What did you do with them?"
"I hung them in the church."
"Why didn't you want to hang them in the tree?"
"Because it was said that the fairies were of kin to the Fiend, and thatit was sinful to show them honor."
"Did you believe it was wrong to honor them so?"
"Yes. I thought it must be wrong."
"Then if it was wrong to honor them in that way, and if they were of kinto the Fiend, they could be dangerous company for you and the otherchildren, couldn't they?"
"I suppose so--yes, I think so."
He studied a minute, and I judged he was going to spring his trap, and hedid. He said:
"Then the matter stands like this. They were banned creatures, of fearfulorigin; they could be dangerous company for the children. Now give me arational reason, dear, if you can think of any, why you call it a wrongto drive them into banishment, and why you would have saved them from it.In a word, what loss have you suffered by it?"
How stupid of him to go and throw his case away like that! I could haveboxed his ears for vexation if he had been a boy. He was going along allright until he ruined everything by winding up in that foolish and fatalway. What had she lost by it! Was he never going to find out what kind ofa child Joan of Arc was? Was he never going to learn that things whichmerely concerned her own gain or loss she cared nothing about? Could henever get the simple fact into his head that the sure way and the onlyway to rouse her up and set her on fire was to show her where some otherperson was going to suffer wrong or hurt or loss? Why, he had gone andset a trap for himself--that was all he had accomplished.
The minute those words were out of his mouth her temper was up, theindignant tears rose in her eyes, and she burst out on him with an energyand passion which astonished him, but didn't astonish me, for I knew hehad fired a mine when he touched off his ill-chosen climax.
"Oh, father, how can you talk like that? Who owns France?"
"God and the King."
"Not Satan?"
"Satan, my child? This is the footstool of the Most High--Satan owns nohandful of its soil."
"Then who gave those poor creatures their home? God. Who protected themin it all those centuries? God. Who allowed them to dance and play thereall those centuries and found no fault with it? God. Who disapproved ofGod's approval and put a threat upon them? A man. Who caught them againin harmless sports that God allowed and a man forbade, and carried outthat threat, and drove the poor things away from the home the good Godgave them in His mercy and His pity, and sent down His rain and dew andsunshine upon it five hundred years in token of His peace? It was theirhome--theirs, by the grace of God and His good heart, and no man had aright to rob them of it. And they were the gentlest, truest friends thatchildren ever had, and did them sweet and loving service all these fivelong centuries, and never any hurt or harm; and the children loved them,and now they mourn for them, and there is no healing for their grief. Andwhat had the children done that they should suffer this cruel stroke? Thepoor fairies could have been dangerous company for the children? Yes, butnever had been; and could is no argument. Kinsmen of the Fiend? What ofit? Kinsmen of the Fiend have rights, and these had; and children haverights, and these had; and if I had been there I would have spoken--Iwould have begged for the children and the fiends, and stayed your handand saved them all. But now--oh, now, all is lost; everything is lost,and there is no help more!"
Then she finished with a blast at that idea that fairy kinsmen of theFiend ought to be shunned and denied human sympathy and friendshipbecause salvation was barred against them. She said that for that veryreason people ought to pity them, and do every humane and loving thingthey could to make them forget the hard fate that had been put upon themby accident of birth and no fault of their own. "Poor little creatures!"she said. "What can a person's heart be made of that can pity aChristian's child and yet can't pity a devil's child, that a thousandtimes more needs it!"
She had torn loose from Pere Fronte, and was crying, with her knuckles inher eyes, and stamping her small feet in a fury; and now she burst out ofthe place and was gone before we could gather our senses together out ofthis storm of words and this whirlwind of passion.
The Pere had got upon his feet, toward the last, and now he stood therepassing his hand back and forth across his forehead like a person who isdazed and troubled; then he turned and wandered toward the door of hislittle workroom, and as he passed through it I heard him murmursorrowfully:
"Ah, me, poor children, poor fiends, they have rights, and she saidtrue--I never thought of that. God forgive me, I am to blame."
When I heard that, I knew I was right in the thought that he had set atrap for himself. It was so, and he had walked into it, you see. I seemedto feel encouraged, and wondered if mayhap I might get him into one; butupon reflection my heart went down, for this was not my gift.
