A DIALOGUE. Persons: Cyril and Vivian. Scene: the Library of acountry house in Nottinghamshire.CYRIL (coming in through the open window from the terrace). Mydear Vivian, don't coop yourself up all day in the library. It isa perfectly lovely afternoon. The air is exquisite. There is amist upon the woods, like the purple bloom upon a plum. Let us goand lie on the grass and smoke cigarettes and enjoy Nature.VIVIAN. Enjoy Nature! I am glad to say that I have entirely lostthat faculty. People tell us that Art makes us love Nature morethan we loved her before; that it reveals her secrets to us; andthat after a careful study of Corot and Constable we see things inher that had escaped our observation. My own experience is thatthe more we study Art, the less we care for Nature. What Artreally reveals to us is Nature's lack of design, her curiouscrudities, her extraordinary monotony, her absolutely unfinishedcondition. Nature has good intentions, of course, but, asAristotle once said, she cannot carry them out. When I look at alandscape I cannot help seeing all its defects. It is fortunatefor us, however, that Nature is so imperfect, as otherwise weshould have no art at all. Art is our spirited protest, ourgallant attempt to teach Nature her proper place. As for theinfinite variety of Nature, that is a pure myth. It is not to befound in Nature herself. It resides in the imagination, or fancy,or cultivated blindness of the man who looks at her.CYRIL. Well, you need not look at the landscape. You can lie onthe grass and smoke and talk.VIVIAN. But Nature is so uncomfortable. Grass is hard and lumpyand damp, and full of dreadful black insects. Why, even Morris'spoorest workman could make you a more comfortable seat than thewhole of Nature can. Nature pales before the furniture of 'thestreet which from Oxford has borrowed its name,' as the poet youlove so much once vilely phrased it. I don't complain. If Naturehad been comfortable, mankind would never have inventedarchitecture, and I prefer houses to the open air. In a house weall feel of the proper proportions. Everything is subordinated tous, fashioned for our use and our pleasure. Egotism itself, whichis so necessary to a proper sense of human dignity, is entirely theresult of indoor life. Out of doors one becomes abstract andimpersonal. One's individuality absolutely leaves one. And thenNature is so indifferent, so unappreciative. Whenever I am walkingin the park here, I always feel that I am no more to her than thecattle that browse on the slope, or the burdock that blooms in theditch. Nothing is more evident than that Nature hates Mind.Thinking is the most unhealthy thing in the world, and people dieof it just as they die of any other disease. Fortunately, inEngland at any rate, thought is not catching. Our splendidphysique as a people is entirely due to our national stupidity. Ionly hope we shall be able to keep this great historic bulwark ofour happiness for many years to come; but I am afraid that we arebeginning to be over-educated; at least everybody who is incapableof learning has taken to teaching--that is really what ourenthusiasm for education has come to. In the meantime, you hadbetter go back to your wearisome uncomfortable Nature, and leave meto correct my proofs.CYRIL. Writing an article! That is not very consistent after whatyou have just said.VIVIAN. Who wants to be consistent? The dullard and thedoctrinaire, the tedious people who carry out their principles tothe bitter end of action, to the reductio ad absurdum of practice.Not I. Like Emerson, I write over the door of my library the word'Whim.' Besides, my article is really a most salutary and valuablewarning. If it is attended to, there may be a new Renaissance ofArt.CYRIL. What is the subject?VIVIAN. I intend to call it 'The Decay of Lying: A Protest.'CYRIL. Lying! I should have thought that our politicians kept upthat habit.VIVIAN. I assure you that they do not. They never rise beyond thelevel of misrepresentation, and actually condescend to prove, todiscuss, to argue. How different from the temper of the true liar,with his frank, fearless statements, his superb irresponsibility,his healthy, natural disdain of proof of any kind! After all, whatis a fine lie? Simply that which is its own evidence. If a man issufficiently unimaginative to produce evidence in support of a lie,he might just as well speak the truth at once. No, the politicianswon't do. Something may, perhaps, be urged on behalf of the Bar.The mantle of the Sophist has fallen on its members. Their feignedardours and unreal rhetoric are delightful. They can make theworse appear the better cause, as though they were fresh fromLeontine schools, and have been known to wrest from reluctantjuries triumphant verdicts of acquittal for their clients, evenwhen those clients, as often happens, were clearly andunmistakeably innocent. But they are briefed by the prosaic, andare not ashamed to appeal to precedent. In spite of theirendeavours, the truth will out. Newspapers, even, havedegenerated. They may now be absolutely relied upon. One feels itas one wades through their columns. It is always the unreadablethat occurs. I am afraid that there is not much to be said infavour of either the lawyer or the journalist. Besides, what I ampleading for is Lying in art. Shall I read you what I havewritten? It might do you a great deal of good.CYRIL. Certainly, if you give me a cigarette. Thanks. By theway, what magazine do you intend it for?VIVIAN. For the Retrospective Review. I think I told you that theelect had revived it.CYRIL. Whom do you mean by 'the elect'?VIVIAN. Oh, The Tired Hedonists, of course. It is a club to whichI belong. We are supposed to wear faded roses in our button-holeswhen we meet, and to have a sort of cult for Domitian. I am afraidyou are not eligible. You are too fond of simple pleasures.CYRIL. I should be black-balled on the ground of animal spirits, Isuppose?VIVIAN. Probably. Besides, you are a little too old. We don'tadmit anybody who is of the usual age.CYRIL. Well, I should fancy you are all a good deal bored witheach other.VIVIAN. We are. This is one of the objects of the club. Now, ifyou promise not to interrupt too often, I will read you my article.CYRIL. You will find me all attention.VIVIAN (reading in a very clear, musical voice). THE DECAY OFLYING: A PROTEST.--One of the chief causes that can be assignedfor the curiously commonplace character of most of the literatureof our age is undoubtedly the decay of Lying as an art, a science,and a social pleasure. The ancient historians gave us delightfulfiction in the form of fact; the modem novelist presents us withdull facts under the guise of fiction. The Blue-Book is rapidlybecoming his ideal both for method and manner. He has his tediousdocument humain, his miserable little coin de la creation, intowhich he peers with his microscope. He is to be found at theLibrairie Nationale, or at the British Museum, shamelessly readingup his subject. He has not even the courage of other people'sideas, but insists on going directly to life for everything, andultimately, between encyclopaedias and personal experience, hecomes to the ground, having drawn his types from the family circleor from the weekly washerwoman, and having acquired an amount ofuseful information from which never, even in his most meditativemoments, can he thoroughly free himself.'The lose that results to literature in general from this falseideal of our time can hardly be overestimated. People have acareless way of talking about a "born liar," just as they talkabout a "born poet." But in both cases they are wrong. Lying andpoetry are arts--arts, as Pinto saw, not unconnected with eachother--and they require the most careful study, the mostdisinterested devotion. Indeed, they have their technique, just asthe more material arts of painting and sculpture have, their subtlesecrets of form and colour, their craft-mysteries, their deliberateartistic methods. As one knows the poet by his fine music, so onecan recognise the liar by his rich rhythmic utterance, and inneither case will the casual inspiration of the moment suffice.Here, as elsewhere, practice must, precede perfection. But inmodern days while the fashion of writing poetry has become far toocommon, and should, if possible, be discouraged, the fashion oflying has almost fallen into disrepute. Many a young man starts inlife with a natural gift for exaggeration which, if nurtured incongenial and sympathetic surroundings, or by the imitation of thebest models, might grow into something really great and wonderful.But, as a rule, he comes to nothing. He either falls into carelesshabits of accuracy--'CYRIL. My dear fellow!VIVIAN. Please don't interrupt in the middle of a sentence. 'Heeither falls into careless habits of accuracy, or takes tofrequenting the society of the aged and the well-informed. Boththings are equally fatal to his imagination, as indeed they wouldbe fatal to the imagination of anybody, and in a short time hedevelops a morbid and unhealthy faculty of truth-telling, begins toverify all statements made in his presence, has no hesitation incontradicting people who are much younger than himself, and oftenends by writing novels which are so lifelike that no one canpossibly believe in their probability. This is no isolatedinstance that we are giving. It is simply one example out of many;and if something cannot be done to check, or at least to modify,our monstrous worship of facts, Art will become sterile, and beautywill pass away from the land.'Even Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson, that delightful master ofdelicate and fanciful prose, is tainted with this modern vice, forwe know positively no other name for it. There is such a thing asrobbing a story of its reality by trying to make it too true, andThe Black Arrow is so inartistic as not to contain a singleanachronism to boast of, while the transformation of Dr. Jekyllreads dangerously like an experiment out of the Lancet. As for Mr.Rider Haggard, who really has, or had once, the makings of aperfectly magnificent liar, he is now so afraid of being suspectedof genius that when he does tell us anything marvellous, he feelsbound to invent a personal reminiscence, and to put it into afootnote as a kind of cowardly corroboration. Nor are our othernovelists much better. Mr. Henry James writes fiction as if itwere a painful duty, and wastes upon mean motives and imperceptible"points of view" his neat literary style, his felicitous phrases,his swift and caustic satire. Mr. Hall Caine, it is true, aims atthe grandiose, but then he writes at the top of his voice. He isso loud that one cannot bear what he says. Mr. James Payn is anadept in the art of concealing what is not worth finding. He huntsdown the obvious with the enthusiasm of a short-sighted detective.As one turns over the pages, the suspense of the author becomesalmost unbearable. The horses of Mr. William Black's phaeton donot soar towards the sun. They merely frighten the sky at eveninginto violent chromolithographic effects. On seeing them approach,the peasants take refuge in dialect. Mrs. Oliphant prattlespleasantly about curates, lawn-tennis parties, domesticity, andother wearisome things. Mr. Marion Crawford has immolated himselfupon the altar of local colour. He is like the lady in the Frenchcomedy who keeps talking about "le beau ciel d'Italie." Besides,he has fallen into the bad habit of uttering moral platitudes. Heis always telling us that to be good is to be good, and that to bebad is to be wicked. At times he is almost edifying. RobertElsmere is of course a masterpiece--a masterpiece of the "genreennuyeux," the one form of literature that the English people seemsthoroughly to enjoy. A thoughtful young friend of ours once toldus that it reminded him of the sort of conversation that goes on ata meat tea in the house of a serious Nonconformist family, and wecan quite believe it. Indeed it is only in England that such abook could be produced. England is the home of lost ideas. As forthat great and daily increasing school of novelists for whom thesun always rises in the East-End, the only thing that can be saidabout them is that they find life crude, and leave it raw.'In France, though nothing so deliberately tedious as RobertElsmere has been produced, things are not much better. M. Guy deMaupassant, with his keen mordant irony and his hard vivid style,strips life of the few poor rags that still cover her, and shows usfoul sore and festering wound. He writes lurid little tragedies inwhich everybody is ridiculous; bitter comedies at which one cannotlaugh for very tears. M. Zola, true to the lofty principle that helays down in one of his pronunciamientos on literature, "L'homme degenie n'a jamais d'esprit," is determined to show that, if he hasnot got genius, he can at least be dull. And how well he succeeds!He is not without power. Indeed at times, as in Germinal, there issomething almost epic in his work. But his work is entirely wrongfrom beginning to end, and wrong not on the ground of morals, buton the ground of art. From any ethical standpoint it is just whatit should be. The author is perfectly truthful, and describesthings exactly as they happen. What more can any moralist desire?We have no sympathy at all with the moral indignation of our timeagainst M. Zola. It is simply the indignation of Tartuffe on beingexposed. But from the standpoint of art, what can be said infavour of the author of L'Assommoir, Nana and Pot-Bouille?Nothing. Mr. Ruskin once described the characters in GeorgeEliot's novels as being like the sweepings of a Pentonvilleomnibus, but M. Zola's characters are much worse. They have theirdreary vices, and their drearier virtues. The record of theirlives is absolutely without interest. Who cares what happens tothem? In literature we require distinction, charm, beauty andimaginative power. We don't want to be harrowed and disgusted withan account of the doings of the lower orders. M. Daudet is better.He has wit, a light touch and an amusing style. But he has latelycommitted literary suicide. Nobody can possibly care for Delobellewith his "Il faut lutter pour l'art," or for Valmajour with hiseternal refrain about the nightingale, or for the poet in Jack withhis "mots cruels," now that we have learned from Vingt Ans de maVie litteraire that these characters were taken directly from life.To us they seem to have suddenly lost all their vitality, all thefew qualities they ever possessed. The only real people are thepeople who never existed, and if a novelist is base enough to go tolife for his personages he should at least pretend that they arecreations, and not boast of them as copies. The justification of acharacter in a novel is not that other persons are what they are,but that the author is what he is. Otherwise the novel is not awork of art. As for M. Paul Bourget, the master of the romanpsychologique, he commits the error of imagining that the men andwomen of modern life are capable of being infinitely analysed foran innumerable series of chapters. In point of fact what isinteresting about people in good society--and M. Bourget rarelymoves out of the Faubourg St. Germain, except to come to London,--is the mask that each one of them wears, not the reality that liesbehind the mask. It is a humiliating confession, but we are all ofus made out of the same stuff. In Falstaff there is something ofHamlet, in Hamlet there is not a little of Falstaff. The fatknight has his moods of melancholy, and the young prince hismoments of coarse humour. Where we differ from each other ispurely in accidentals: in dress, manner, tone of voice, religiousopinions, personal appearance, tricks of habit and the like. Themore one analyses people, the more all reasons for analysisdisappear. Sooner or later one comes to that dreadful universalthing called human nature. Indeed, as any one who has ever workedamong the poor knows only too well, the brotherhood of man is nomere poet's dream, it is a most depressing and humiliating reality;and if a writer insists upon analysing the upper classes, he mightjust as well write of match-girls and costermongers at once.'However, my dear Cyril, I will not detain you any further justhere. I quite admit that modern novels have many good points. AllI insist on is that, as a class, they are quite unreadable.CYRIL. That is certainly a very grave qualification, but I mustsay that I think you are rather unfair in some of your strictures.I like The Deemster, and The Daughter of Heth, and Le Disciple, andMr. Isaacs, and as for Robert Elsmere, I am quite devoted to it.Not that I can look upon it as a serious work. As a statement ofthe problems that confront the earnest Christian it is ridiculousand antiquated. It is simply Arnold's Literature and Dogma withthe literature left out. It is as much behind the age as Paley'sEvidences, or Colenso's method of Biblical exegesis. Nor couldanything be less impressive than the unfortunate hero gravelyheralding a dawn that rose long ago, and so completely missing itstrue significance that he proposes to carry on the business of theold firm under the new name. On the other hand, it containsseveral clever caricatures, and a heap of delightful quotations,and Green's philosophy very pleasantly sugars the somewhat bitterpill of the author's fiction. I also cannot help expressing mysurprise that you have said nothing about the two novelists whomyou are always reading, Balzac and George Meredith. Surely theyare realists, both of them?VIVIAN. Ah! Meredith! Who can define him? His style is chaosillumined by flashes of lightning. As a writer he has masteredeverything except language: as a novelist he can do everything,except tell a story: as an artist he is everything exceptarticulate. Somebody in Shakespeare--Touchstone, I think--talksabout a man who is always breaking his shins over his own wit, andit seems to me that this might serve as the basis for a criticismof Meredith's method. But whatever he is, he is not a realist. Orrather I would say that he is a child of realism who is not onspeaking terms with his father. By deliberate choice he has madehimself a romanticist. He has refused to bow the knee to Baal, andafter all, even if the man's fine spirit did not revolt against thenoisy assertions of realism, his style would be quite sufficient ofitself to keep life at a respectful distance. By its means he hasplanted round his garden a hedge full of thorns, and red withwonderful roses. As for Balzac, he was a most remarkablecombination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit.The latter he bequeathed to his disciples. The former was entirelyhis own. The difference between such a book as M. Zola'sL'Assommoir and Balzac's Illusions Perdues is the differencebetween unimaginative realism and imaginative reality. 'AllBalzac's characters;' said Baudelaire, 'are gifted with the sameardour of life that animated himself. All his fictions are asdeeply coloured as dreams. Each mind is a weapon loaded to themuzzle with will. The very scullions have genius.' A steadycourse of Balzac reduces our living friends to shadows, and ouracquaintances to the shadows of shades. His characters have a kindof fervent fiery-coloured existence. They dominate us, and defyscepticism. One of the greatest tragedies of my life is the deathof Lucien de Rubempre. It is a grief from which I have never beenable completely to rid myself. It haunts me in my moments ofpleasure. I remember it when I laugh. But Balzac is no more arealist than Holbein was. He created life, he did not copy it. Iadmit, however, that he set far too high a value on modernity ofform, and that, consequently, there is no book of his that, as anartistic masterpiece, can rank with Salammbo or Esmond, or TheCloister and the Hearth, or the Vicomte de Bragelonne.CYRIL. Do you object to modernity of form, then?VIVIAN. Yes. It is a huge price to pay for a very poor result.Pure modernity of form is always somewhat vulgarising. It cannothelp being so. The public imagine that, because they areinterested in their immediate surroundings, Art should beinterested in them also, and should take them as her subject-matter. But the mere fact that they are interested in these thingsmakes them unsuitable subjects for Art. The only beautiful things,as somebody once said, are the things that do not concern us. Aslong as a thing is useful or necessary to us, or affects us in anyway, either for pain or for pleasure, or appeals strongly to oursympathies, or is a vital part of the environment in which we live,it is outside the proper sphere of art. To art's subject-matter weshould be more or less indifferent. We should, at any rate, haveno preferences, no prejudices, no partisan feeling of any kind. Itis exactly because Hecuba is nothing to us that her sorrows aresuch an admirable motive for a tragedy. I do not know anything inthe whole history of literature sadder than the artistic career ofCharles Reade. He wrote one beautiful book, The Cloister and theHearth, a book as much above Romola as Romola is above DanielDeronda, and wasted the rest of his life in a foolish attempt to bemodern, to draw public attention to the state of our convictprisons, and the management of our private lunatic asylums.Charles Dickens was depressing enough in all conscience when hetried to arouse our sympathy for the victims of the poor-lawadministration; but Charles Reade, an artist, a scholar, a man witha true sense of beauty, raging and roaring over the abuses ofcontemporary life like a common pamphleteer or a sensationaljournalist, is really a sight for the angels to weep over. Believeme, my dear Cyril, modernity of form and modernity of subject-matter are entirely and absolutely wrong. We have mistaken thecommon livery of the age for the vesture of the Muses, and spendour days in the sordid streets and hideous suburbs of our vilecities when we should be out on the hillside with Apollo.Certainly we are a degraded race, and have sold our birthright fora mess of facts.CYRIL. There is something in what you say, and there is no doubtthat whatever amusement we may find in reading a purely modelnovel, we have rarely any artistic pleasure in re-reading it. Andthis is perhaps the best rough test of what is literature and whatis not. If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again,there is no use reading it at all. But what do you say about thereturn to Life and Nature? This is the panacea that is alwaysbeing recommended to us.VIVIAN. I will read you what I say on that subject. The passagecomes later on in the article, but I may as well give it to younow:-'The popular cry of our time is "Let us return to Life and Nature;they will recreate Art for us, and send the red blood coursingthrough her veins; they will shoe her feet with swiftness and makeher hand strong." But, alas! we are mistaken in our amiable andwell-meaning efforts. Nature is always behind the age. And as forLife, she is the solvent that breaks up Art, the enemy that layswaste her house.'CYRIL. What do you mean by saying that Nature is always behind theage?VIVIAN. Well, perhaps that is rather cryptic. What I mean isthis. If we take Nature to mean natural simple instinct as opposedto self-conscious culture, the work produced under this influenceis always old-fashioned, antiquated, and out of date. One touch ofNature may make the whole world kin, but two touches of Nature willdestroy any work of Art. If, on the other hand, we regard Natureas the collection of phenomena external to man, people onlydiscover in her what they bring to her. She has no suggestions ofher own. Wordsworth went to the lakes, but he was never a lakepoet. He found in stones the sermons he had already hidden there.He went moralising about the district, but his good work wasproduced when he returned, not to Nature but to poetry. Poetrygave him 'Laodamia,' and the fine sonnets, and the great Ode, suchas it is. Nature gave him 'Martha Ray' and 'Peter Bell,' and theaddress to Mr. Wilkinson's spade.CYRIL. I think that view might be questioned. I am ratherinclined to believe in 'the impulse from a vernal wood,' though ofcourse the artistic value of such an impulse depends entirely onthe kind of temperament that receives it, so that the return toNature would come to mean simply the advance to a greatpersonality. You would agree with that, I fancy. However, proceedwith your article.VIVIAN (reading). 'Art begins with abstract decoration, withpurely imaginative and pleasurable work dealing with what is unrealand non-existent. This is the first stage. Then Life becomesfascinated with this new wonder, and asks to be admitted into thecharmed circle. Art takes life as part of her rough material,recreates it, and refashions it in fresh forms, is absolutelyindifferent to fact, invents, imagines, dreams, and keeps betweenherself and reality the impenetrable barrier of beautiful style, ofdecorative or ideal treatment. The third stage is when Life getsthe upper hand, and drives Art out into the wilderness. That isthe true decadence, and it is from this that we are now suffering.'Take the case of the English drama. At first in the hands of themonks Dramatic Art was abstract, decorative and mythological. Thenshe enlisted Life in her service, and using some of life's externalforms, she created an entirely new race of beings, whose sorrowswere more terrible than any sorrow man has ever felt, whose joyswere keener than lover's joys, who had the rage of the Titans andthe calm of the gods, who had monstrous and marvellous sins,monstrous and marvellous virtues. To them she gave a languagedifferent from that of actual use, a language full of resonantmusic and sweet rhythm, made stately by solemn cadence, or madedelicate by fanciful rhyme, jewelled with wonderful words, andenriched with lofty diction. She clothed her children in strangeraiment and gave them masks, and at her bidding the antique worldrose from its marble tomb. A new Caesar stalked through thestreets of risen Rome, and with purple sail and flute-led oarsanother Cleopatra passed up the river to Antioch. Old myth andlegend and dream took shape and substance. History was entirelyre-written, and there was hardly one of the dramatists who did notrecognise that the object of Art is not simple truth but complexbeauty. In this they were perfectly right. Art itself is really aform of exaggeration; and selection, which is the very spirit ofart, is nothing more than an intensified mode of over-emphasis.'But Life soon shattered the perfection of the form. Even inShakespeare we can see the beginning of the end. It shows itselfby the gradual breaking-up of the blank-verse in the later plays,by the predominance given to prose, and by the over-importanceassigned to characterisation. The passages in Shakespeare--andthey are many--where the language is uncouth, vulgar, exaggerated,fantastic, obscene even, are entirely due to Life calling for anecho of her own voice, and rejecting the intervention of beautifulstyle, through which alone should life be suffered to findexpression. Shakespeare is not by any means a flawless artist. Heis too fond of going directly to life, and borrowing life's naturalutterance. He forgets that when Art surrenders her imaginativemedium she surrenders everything. Goethe says, somewhere -In der Beschrankung zeigt Fsich erst der Meister,"It is in working within limits that the master reveals himself,"and the limitation, the very condition of any art is style.However, we need not linger any longer over Shakespeare's realism.The Tempest is the most perfect of palinodes. All that we desiredto point out was, that the magnificent work of the Elizabethan andJacobean artists contained within itself the seeds of its owndissolution, and that, if it drew some of its strength from usinglife as rough material, it drew all its weakness from using life asan artistic method. As the inevitable result of this substitutionof an imitative for a creative medium, this surrender of animaginative form, we have the modern English melodrama. Thecharacters in these plays talk on the stage exactly as they wouldtalk off it; they have neither aspirations nor aspirates; they aretaken directly from life and reproduce its vulgarity down to thesmallest detail; they present the gait, manner, costume and accentof real people; they would pass unnoticed in a third-class railwaycarriage. And yet how wearisome the plays are! They do notsucceed in producing even that impression of reality at which theyaim, and which is their only reason for existing. As a method,realism is a complete failure.'What is true about the drama and the novel is no less true aboutthose arts that we call the decorative arts. The whole history ofthese arts in Europe is the record of the struggle betweenOrientalism, with its frank rejection of imitation, its love ofartistic convention, its dislike to the actual representation ofany object in Nature, and our own imitative spirit. Wherever theformer has been paramount, as in Byzantium, Sicily and Spain, byactual contact, or in the rest of Europe by the influence of theCrusades, we have had beautiful and imaginative work in which thevisible things of life are transmuted into artistic conventions,and the things that Life has not are invented and fashioned for herdelight. But wherever we have returned to Life and Nature, ourwork has always become vulgar, common and uninteresting. Moderntapestry, with its aerial effects, its elaborate perspective, itsbroad expanses of waste sky, its faithful and laborious realism,has no beauty whatsoever. The pictorial glass of Germany isabsolutely detestable. We are beginning to weave possible carpetsin England, but only because we have returned to the method andspirit of the East. Our rugs and carpets of twenty years ago, withtheir solemn depressing truths, their inane worship of Nature,their sordid reproductions of visible objects, have become, even tothe Philistine, a source of laughter. A cultured Mahomedan onceremarked to us, "You Christians are so occupied in misinterpretingthe fourth commandment that you have never thought of making anartistic application of the second." He was perfectly right, andthe whole truth of the matter is this: The proper school to learnart in is not Life but Art.'And now let me read you a passage which seems to me to settle thequestion very completely.'It was not always thus. We need not say anything about the poets,for they, with the unfortunate exception of Mr. Wordsworth, havebeen really faithful to their high mission, and are universallyrecognised as being absolutely unreliable. But in the works ofHerodotus, who, in spite of the shallow and ungenerous attempts ofmodem sciolists to verify his history, may justly be called the"Father of Lies"; in the published speeches of Cicero and thebiographies of Suetonius; in Tacitus at his best; in Pliny'sNatural History; in Hanno's Periplus; in all the early chronicles;in the Lives of the Saints; in Froissart and Sir Thomas Malory; inthe travels of Marco Polo; in Olaus Magnus, and Aldrovandus, andConrad Lycosthenes, with his magnificent Prodigiorum et OstentorumChronicon; in the autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini; in thememoirs of Casanova; in Defoe's History of the Plague; in Boswell'sLife of Johnson; in Napoleon's despatches, and in the works of ourown Carlyle, whose French Revolution is one of the most fascinatinghistorical novels ever written, facts are either kept in theirproper subordinate position, or else entirely excluded on thegeneral ground of dulness. Now, everything is changed. Facts arenot merely finding a footing-place in history, but they areusurping the domain of Fancy, and have invaded the kingdom ofRomance. Their chilling touch is over everything. They arevulgarising mankind. The crude commercialism of America, itsmaterialising spirit, its indifference to the poetical side ofthings, and its lack of imagination and of high unattainableideals, are entirely due to that country having adopted for itsnational hero a man who, according to his own confession, wasincapable of telling a lie, and it is not too much to say that thestory of George Washington and the cherry-tree has done more harm,and in a shorter space of time, than any other moral tale in thewhole of literature.'CYRIL. My dear boy!VIVIAN. I assure you it is the case, and the amusing part of thewhole thing is that the story of the cherry-tree is an absolutemyth. However, you must not think that I am too despondent aboutthe artistic future either of America or of our own country.Listen to this:-'That some change will take place before this century has drawn toits close we have no doubt whatsoever. Bored by the tedious andimproving conversation of those who have neither the wit toexaggerate nor the genius to romance, tired of the intelligentperson whose reminiscences are always based upon memory, whosestatements are invariably limited by probability, and who is at anytime liable to be corroborated by the merest Philistine who happensto be present, Society sooner or later must return to its lostleader, the cultured and fascinating liar. Who he was who first,without ever having gone out to the rude chase, told the wanderingcavemen at sunset how he had dragged the Megatherium from thepurple darkness of its jasper cave, or slain the Mammoth in singlecombat and brought back its gilded tusks, we cannot tell, and notone of our modern anthropologists, for all their much-boastedscience, has had the ordinary courage to tell us. Whatever was hisname or race, he certainly was the true founder of socialintercourse. For the aim of the liar is simply to charm, todelight, to give pleasure. He is the very basis of civilisedsociety, and without him a dinner-party, even at the mansions ofthe great, is as dull as a lecture at the Royal Society, or adebate at the Incorporated Authors, or one of Mr. Burnand'sfarcical comedies.'Nor will he be welcomed by society alone. Art, breaking from theprison-house of realism, will run to greet him, and will kiss hisfalse, beautiful lips, knowing that he alone is in possession ofthe great secret of all her manifestations, the secret that Truthis entirely and absolutely a matter of style; while Life--poor,probable, uninteresting human life--tired of repeating herself forthe benefit of Mr. Herbert Spencer, scientific historians, and thecompilers of statistics in general, will follow meekly after him,and try to reproduce, in her own simple and untutored way, some ofthe marvels of which he talks.'No doubt there will always be critics who, like a certain writerin the Saturday Review, will gravely censure the teller of fairytales for his defective knowledge of natural history, who willmeasure imaginative work by their own lack of any imaginativefaculty, and will hold up their ink-stained hands in horror if somehonest gentleman, who has never been farther than the yew-trees ofhis own garden, pens a fascinating book of travels like Sir JohnMandeville, or, like great Raleigh, writes a whole history of theworld, without knowing anything whatsoever about the past. Toexcuse themselves they will try and shelter under the shield of himwho made Prospero the magician, and gave him Caliban and Ariel ashis servants, who heard the Tritons blowing their horns round thecoral reefs of the Enchanted Isle, and the fairies singing to eachother in a wood near Athens, who led the phantom kings in dimprocession across the misty Scottish heath, and hid Hecate in acave with the weird sisters. They will call upon Shakespeare--theyalways do--and will quote that hackneyed passage forgetting thatthis unfortunate aphorism about Art holding the mirror up toNature, is deliberately said by Hamlet in order to convince thebystanders of his absolute insanity in all art-matters.'CYRIL. Ahem! Another cigarette, please.VIVIAN. My dear fellow, whatever you may say, it is merely adramatic utterance, and no more represents Shakespeare's real viewsupon art than the speeches of Iago represent his real views uponmorals. But let me get to the end of the passage:'Art finds her own perfection within, and not outside of, herself.She is not to be judged by any external standard of resemblance.She is a veil, rather than a mirror. She has flowers that noforests know of, birds that no woodland possesses. She makes andunmakes many worlds, and can draw the moon from heaven with ascarlet thread. Hers are the "forms more real than living man,"and hers the great archetypes of which things that have existenceare but unfinished copies. Nature has, in her eyes, no laws, nouniformity. She can work miracles at her will, and when she callsmonsters from the deep they come. She can bid the almond-treeblossom in winter, and send the snow upon the ripe cornfield. Ather word the frost lays its silver finger on the burning mouth ofJune, and the winged lions creep out from the hollows of the Lydianhills. The dryads peer from the thicket as she passes by, and thebrown fauns smile strangely at her when she comes near them. Shehas hawk-faced gods that worship her, and the centaurs gallop ather side.'CYRIL. I like that. I can see it. Is that the end?VIVIAN. No. There is one more passage, but it is purelypractical. It simply suggests some methods by which we couldrevive this lost art of Lying.CYRIL. Well, before you read it to me, I should like to ask you aquestion. What do you mean by saying that life, 'poor, probable,uninteresting human life,' will try to reproduce the marvels ofart? I can quite understand your objection to art being treated asa mirror. You think it would reduce genius to the position of acracked looking-glass. But you don't mean to say that youseriously believe that Life imitates Art, that Life in fact is themirror, and Art the reality?VIVIAN. Certainly I do. Paradox though it may seem--and paradoxesare always dangerous things--it is none the less true that Lifeimitates art far more than Art imitates life. We have all seen inour own day in England how a certain curious and fascinating typeof beauty, invented and emphasised by two imaginative painters, hasso influenced Life that whenever one goes to a private view or toan artistic salon one sees, here the mystic eyes of Rossetti'sdream, the long ivory throat, the strange square-cut jaw, theloosened shadowy hair that he so ardently loved, there the sweetmaidenhood of 'The Golden Stair,' the blossom-like mouth and wearyloveliness of the 'Laus Amoris,' the passion-pale face ofAndromeda, the thin hands and lithe beauty of the Vivian in'Merlin's Dream.' And it has always been so. A great artistinvents a type, and Life tries to copy it, to reproduce it in apopular form, like an enterprising publisher. Neither Holbein norVandyck found in England what they have given us. They broughttheir types with them, and Life with her keen imitative faculty setherself to supply the master with models. The Greeks, with theirquick artistic instinct, understood this, and set in the bride'schamber the statue of Hermes or of Apollo, that she might bearchildren as lovely as the works of art that she looked at in herrapture or her pain. They knew that Life gains from art not merelyspirituality, depth of thought and feeling, soul-turmoil or soul-peace, but that she can form herself on the very lines and coloursof art, and can reproduce the dignity of Pheidias as well as thegrace of Praxiteles. Hence came their objection to realism. Theydisliked it on purely social grounds. They felt that it inevitablymakes people ugly, and they were perfectly right. We try toimprove the conditions of the race by means of good air, freesunlight, wholesome water, and hideous bare buildings for thebetter housing of the lower orders. But these things merelyproduce health, they do not produce beauty. For this, Art isrequired, and the true disciples of the great artist are not hisstudio-imitators, but those who become like his works of art, bethey plastic as in Greek days, or pictorial as in modern times; ina word, Life is Art's best, Art's only pupil.As it is with the visible arts, so it is with literature. The mostobvious and the vulgarest form in which this is shown is in thecase of the silly boys who, after reading the adventures of JackSheppard or Dick Turpin, pillage the stalls of unfortunate apple-women, break into sweet-shops at night, and alarm old gentlemen whoare returning home from the city by leaping out on them in suburbanlanes, with black masks and unloaded revolvers. This interestingphenomenon, which always occurs after the appearance of a newedition of either of the books I have alluded to, is usuallyattributed to the influence of literature on the imagination. Butthis is a mistake. The imagination is essentially creative, andalways seeks for a new form. The boy-burglar is simply theinevitable result of life's imitative instinct. He is Fact,occupied as Fact usually is, with trying to reproduce Fiction, andwhat we see in him is repeated on an extended scale throughout thewhole of life. Schopenhauer has analysed the pessimism thatcharacterises modern thought, but Hamlet invented it. The worldhas become sad because a puppet was once melancholy. The Nihilist,that strange martyr who has no faith, who goes to the stake withoutenthusiasm, and dies for what he does not believe in, is a purelyliterary product. He was invented by Tourgenieff, and completed byDostoieffski. Robespierre came out of the pages of Rousseau assurely as the People's Palace rose out of the debris of a novel.Literature always anticipates life. It does not copy it, butmoulds it to its purpose. The nineteenth century, as we know it,is largely an invention of Balzac. Our Luciens de Rubempre, ourRastignacs, and De Marsays made their first appearance on the stageof the Comedie Humaine. We are merely carrying out, with footnotesand unnecessary additions, the whim or fancy or creative vision ofa great novelist. I once asked a lady, who knew Thackerayintimately, whether he had had any model for Becky Sharp. She toldme that Becky was an invention, but that the idea of the characterhad been partly suggested by a governess who lived in theneighbourhood of Kensington Square, and was the companion of a veryselfish and rich old woman. I inquired what became of thegoverness, and she replied that, oddly enough, some years after theappearance of Vanity Fair, she ran away with the nephew of the ladywith whom she was living, and for a short time made a great splashin society, quite in Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's style, and entirely byMrs. Rawdon Crawley's methods. Ultimately she came to grief,disappeared to the Continent, and used to be occasionally seen atMonte Carlo and other gambling places. The noble gentleman fromwhom the same great sentimentalist drew Colonel Newcome died, a fewmonths after The Newcomer had reached a fourth edition, with theword 'Adsum' on his lips. Shortly after Mr. Stevenson publishedhis curious psychological story of transformation, a friend ofmine, called Mr. Hyde, was in the north of London, and beinganxious to get to a railway station, took what he thought would bea short cut, lost his way, and found himself in a network of mean,evil-looking streets. Feeling rather nervous he began to walkextremely fast, when suddenly out of an archway ran a child rightbetween his legs. It fell on the pavement, he tripped over it, andtrampled upon it. Being of course very much frightened and alittle hurt, it began to scream, and in a few seconds the wholestreet was full of rough people who came pouring out of the houseslike ants. They surrounded him, and asked him his name. He wasjust about to give it when he suddenly remembered the openingincident in Mr. Stevenson's story. He was so filled with horror athaving realised in his own person that terrible and well-writtenscene, and at having done accidentally, though in fact, what theMr. Hyde of fiction had done with deliberate intent, that he ranaway as hard as he could go. He was, however, very closelyfollowed, and finally he took refuge in a surgery, the door ofwhich happened to be open, where he explained to a young assistant,who happened to be there, exactly what had occurred. Thehumanitarian crowd were induced to go away on his giving them asmall sum of money, and as soon as the coast was clear he left. Ashe passed out, the name on the brass door-plate of the surgerycaught his eye. It was 'Jekyll.' At least it should have been.Here the imitation, as far as it went, was of course accidental.In the following case the imitation was self-conscious. In theyear 1879, just after I had left Oxford, I met at a reception atthe house of one of the Foreign Ministers a woman of very curiousexotic beauty. We became great friends, and were constantlytogether. And yet what interested me most in her was not herbeauty, but her character, her entire vagueness of character. Sheseemed to have no personality at all, but simply the possibility ofmany types. Sometimes she would give herself up entirely to art,turn her drawing-room into a studio, and spend two or three days aweek at picture galleries or museums. Then she would take toattending race-meetings, wear the most horsey clothes, and talkabout nothing but betting. She abandoned religion for mesmerism,mesmerism for politics, and politics for the melodramaticexcitements of philanthropy. In fact, she was a kind of Proteus,and as much a failure in all her transformations as was thatwondrous sea-god when Odysseus laid hold of him. One day a serialbegan in one of the French magazines. At that time I used to readserial stories, and I well remember the shock of surprise I feltwhen I came to the description of the heroine. She was so like myfriend that I brought her the magazine, and she recognised herselfin it immediately, and seemed fascinated by the resemblance. Ishould tell you, by the way, that the story was translated fromsome dead Russian writer, so that the author had not taken his typefrom my friend. Well, to put the matter briefly, some monthsafterwards I was in Venice, and finding the magazine in thereading-room of the hotel, I took it up casually to see what hadbecome of the heroine. It was a most piteous tale, as the girl hadended by running away with a man absolutely inferior to her, notmerely in social station, but in character and intellect also. Iwrote to my friend that evening about my views on John Bellini, andthe admirable ices at Florian's, and the artistic value ofgondolas, but added a postscript to the effect that her double inthe story had behaved in a very silly manner. I don't know why Iadded that, but I remember I had a sort of dread over me that shemight do the same thing. Before my letter had reached her, she hadrun away with a man who deserted her in six months. I saw her in1884 in Paris, where she was living with her mother, and I askedher whether the story had had anything to do with her action. Shetold me that she had felt an absolutely irresistible impulse tofollow the heroine step by step in her strange and fatal progress,and that it was with a feeling of real terror that she had lookedforward to the last few chapters of the story. When they appeared,it seemed to her that she was compelled to reproduce them in life,and she did so. It was a most clear example of this imitativeinstinct of which I was speaking, and an extremely tragic one.However, I do not wish to dwell any further upon individualinstances. Personal experience is a most vicious and limitedcircle. All that I desire to point out is the general principlethat Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life, and I feelsure that if you think seriously about it you will find that it istrue. Life holds the mirror up to Art, and either reproduces somestrange type imagined by painter or sculptor, or realises in factwhat has been dreamed in fiction. Scientifically speaking, thebasis of life--the energy of life, as Aristotle would call it--issimply the desire for expression, and Art is always presentingvarious forms through which this expression can be attained. Lifeseizes on them and uses them, even if they be to her own hurt.Young men have committed suicide because Rolla did so, have died bytheir own hand because by his own hand Werther died. Think of whatwe owe to the imitation of Christ, of what we owe to the imitationof Caesar.CYRIL. The theory is certainly a very curious one, but to make itcomplete you must show that Nature, no less than Life, is animitation of Art. Are you prepared to prove that?VIVIAN. My dear fellow, I am prepared to prove anything.CYRIL. Nature follows the landscape painter, then, and takes hereffects from him?VIVIAN. Certainly. Where, if not from the Impressionists, do weget those wonderful brown fogs that come creeping down our streets,blurring the gas-lamps and changing the houses into monstrousshadows? To whom, if not to them and their master, do we owe thelovely silver mists that brood over our river, and turn to faintforms of fading grace curved bridge and swaying barge? Theextraordinary change that has taken place in the climate of Londonduring the last ten years is entirely due to a particular school ofArt. You smile. Consider the matter from a scientific or ametaphysical point of view, and you will find that I am right. Forwhat is Nature? Nature is no great mother who has borne us. Sheis our creation. It is in our brain that she quickens to life.Things are because we see them, and what we see, and how we see it,depends on the Arts that have influenced us. To look at a thing isvery different from seeing a thing. One does not see anythinguntil one sees its beauty. Then, and then only, does it come intoexistence. At present, people see fogs, not because there arefogs, but because poets and painters have taught them themysterious loveliness of such effects. There may have been fogsfor centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one sawthem, and so we do not know anything about them. They did notexist till Art had invented them. Now, it must be admitted, fogsare carried to excess. They have become the mere mannerism of aclique, and the exaggerated realism of their method gives dullpeople bronchitis. Where the cultured catch an effect, theuncultured catch cold. And so, let us be humane, and invite Art toturn her wonderful eyes elsewhere. She has done so already,indeed. That white quivering sunlight that one sees now in France,with its strange blotches of mauve, and its restless violetshadows, is her latest fancy, and, on the whole, Nature reproducesit quite admirably. Where she used to give us Corots andDaubignys, she gives us now exquisite Monets and entrancingPissaros. Indeed there are moments, rare, it is true, but still tobe observed from time to time, when Nature becomes absolutelymodern. Of course she is not always to be relied upon. The factis that she is in this unfortunate position. Art creates anincomparable and unique effect, and, having done so, passes on toother things. Nature, upon the other hand, forgetting thatimitation can be made the sincerest form of insult, keeps onrepeating this effect until we all become absolutely wearied of it.Nobody of any real culture, for instance, ever talks nowadays aboutthe beauty of a sunset. Sunsets are quite old-fashioned. Theybelong to the time when Turner was the last note in art. To admirethem is a distinct sign of provincialism of temperament. Upon theother hand they go on. Yesterday evening Mrs. Arundel insisted onmy going to the window, and looking at the glorious sky, as shecalled it. Of course I had to look at it. She is one of thoseabsurdly pretty Philistines to whom one can deny nothing. And whatwas it? It was simply a very second-rate Turner, a Turner of a badperiod, with all the painter's worst faults exaggerated and over-emphasised. Of course, I am quite ready to admit that Life veryoften commits the same error. She produces her false Renes and hersham Vautrins, just as Nature gives us, on one day a doubtful Cuyp,and on another a more than questionable Rousseau. Still, Natureirritates one more when she does things of that kind. It seems sostupid, so obvious, so unnecessary. A false Vautrin might bedelightful. A doubtful Cuyp is unbearable. However, I don't wantto be too hard on Nature. I wish the Channel, especially atHastings, did not look quite so often like a Henry Moore, greypearl with yellow lights, but then, when Art is more varied, Naturewill, no doubt, be more varied also. That she imitates Art, Idon't think even her worst enemy would deny now. It is the onething that keeps her in touch with civilised man. But have Iproved my theory to your satisfaction?CYRIL. You have proved it to my dissatisfaction, which is better.But even admitting this strange imitative instinct in Life andNature, surely you would acknowledge that Art expresses the temperof its age, the spirit of its time, the moral and social conditionsthat surround it, and under whose influence it is produced.VIVIAN. Certainly not! Art never expresses anything but itself.This is the principle of my new aesthetics; and it is this, morethan that vital connection between form and substance, on which Mr.Pater dwells, that makes music the type of all the arts. Ofcourse, nations and individuals, with that healthy natural vanitywhich is the secret of existence, are always under the impressionthat it is of them that the Muses are talking, always trying tofind in the calm dignity of imaginative art some mirror of theirown turbid passions, always forgetting that the singer of life isnot Apollo but Marsyas. Remote from reality, and with her eyesturned away from the shadows of the cave, Art reveals her ownperfection, and the wondering crowd that watches the opening of themarvellous, many-petalled rose fancies that it is its own historythat is being told to it, its own spirit that is finding expressionin a new form. But it is not so. The highest art rejects theburden of the human spirit, and gains more from a new medium or afresh material than she does from any enthusiasm for art, or fromany lofty passion, or from any great awakening of the humanconsciousness. She develops purely on her own lines. She is notsymbolic of any age. It is the ages that are her symbols.Even those who hold that Art is representative of time and placeand people cannot help admitting that the more imitative an art is,the less it represents to us the spirit of its age. The evil facesof the Roman emperors look out at us from the foul porphyry andspotted jasper in which the realistic artists of the day delightedto work, and we fancy that in those cruel lips and heavy sensualjaws we can find the secret of the ruin of the Empire. But it wasnot so. The vices of Tiberius could not destroy that supremecivilisation, any more than the virtues of the Antonines could saveit. It fell for other, for less interesting reasons. The sibylsand prophets of the Sistine may indeed serve to interpret for somethat new birth of the emancipated spirit that we call theRenaissance; but what do the drunken boors and bawling peasants ofDutch art tell us about the great soul of Holland? The moreabstract, the more ideal an art is, the more it reveals to us thetemper of its age. If we wish to understand a nation by means ofits art, let us look at its architecture or its music.CYRIL. I quite agree with you there. The spirit of an age may bebest expressed in the abstract ideal arts, for the spirit itself isabstract and ideal. Upon the other hand, for the visible aspect ofan age, for its look, as the phrase goes, we must of course go tothe arts of imitation.VIVIAN. I don't think so. After all, what the imitative artsreally give us are merely the various styles of particular artists,or of certain schools of artists. Surely you don't imagine thatthe people of the Middle Ages bore any resemblance at all to thefigures on mediaeval stained glass, or in mediaeval stone and woodcarving, or on mediaeval metal-work, or tapestries, or illuminatedMSS. They were probably very ordinary-looking people, with nothinggrotesque, or remarkable, or fantastic in their appearance. TheMiddle Ages, as we know them in art, are simply a definite form ofstyle, and there is no reason at all why an artist with this styleshould not be produced in the nineteenth century. No great artistever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would cease tobe an artist. Take an example from our own day. I know that youare fond of Japanese things. Now, do you really imagine that theJapanese people, as they are presented to us in art, have anyexistence? If you do, you have never understood Japanese art atall. The Japanese people are the deliberate self-consciouscreation of certain individual artists. If you set a picture byHokusai, or Hokkei, or any of the great native painters, beside areal Japanese gentleman or lady, you will see that there is not theslightest resemblance between them. The actual people who live inJapan are not unlike the general run of English people; that is tosay, they are extremely commonplace, and have nothing curious orextraordinary about them. In fact the whole of Japan is a pureinvention. There is no such country, there are no such people.One of our most charming painters went recently to the Land of theChrysanthemum in the foolish hope of seeing the Japanese. All hesaw, all he had the chance of painting, were a few lanterns andsome fans. He was quite unable to discover the inhabitants, as hisdelightful exhibition at Messrs. Dowdeswell's Gallery showed onlytoo well. He did not know that the Japanese people are, as I havesaid, simply a mode of style, an exquisite fancy of art. And so,if you desire to see a Japanese effect, you will not behave like atourist and go to Tokio. On the contrary, you will stay at homeand steep yourself in the work of certain Japanese artists, andthen, when you have absorbed the spirit of their style, and caughttheir imaginative manner of vision, you will go some afternoon andsit in the Park or stroll down Piccadilly, and if you cannot see anabsolutely Japanese effect there, you will not see it anywhere.Or, to return again to the past, take as another instance theancient Greeks. Do you think that Greek art ever tells us what theGreek people were like? Do you believe that the Athenian womenwere like the stately dignified figures of the Parthenon frieze, orlike those marvellous goddesses who sat in the triangular pedimentsof the same building? If you judge from the art, they certainlywere so. But read an authority, like Aristophanes, for instance.You will find that the Athenian ladies laced tightly, wore high-heeled shoes, dyed their hair yellow, painted and rouged theirfaces, and were exactly like any silly fashionable or fallencreature of our own day. The fact is that we look back on the agesentirely through the medium of art, and art, very fortunately, hasnever once told us the truth.CYRIL. But modern portraits by English painters, what of them?Surely they are like the people they pretend to represent?VIVIAN. Quite so. They are so like them that a hundred years fromnow no one will believe in them. The only portraits in which onebelieves are portraits where there is very little of the sitter,and a very great deal of the artist. Holbein's drawings of the menand women of his time impress us with a sense of their absolutereality. But this is simply because Holbein compelled life toaccept his conditions, to restrain itself within his limitations,to reproduce his type, and to appear as he wished it to appear. Itis style that makes us believe in a thing--nothing but style. Mostof our modern portrait painters are doomed to absolute oblivion.They never paint what they see. They paint what the public sees,and the public never sees anything.CYRIL. Well, after that I think I should like to hear the end ofyour article.VIVIAN. With pleasure. Whether it will do any good I reallycannot say. Ours is certainly the dullest and most prosaic centurypossible. Why, even Sleep has played us false, and has closed upthe gates of ivory, and opened the gates of horn. The dreams ofthe great middle classes of this country, as recorded in Mr.Myers's two bulky volumes on the subject, and in the Transactionsof the Psychical Society, are the most depressing things that Ihave ever read. There is not even a fine nightmare among them.They are commonplace, sordid and tedious. As for the Church, Icannot conceive anything better for the culture of a country thanthe presence in it of a body of men whose duty it is to believe inthe supernatural, to perform daily miracles, and to keep alive thatmythopoeic faculty which is so essential for the imagination. Butin the English Church a man succeeds, not through his capacity forbelief, but through his capacity for disbelief. Ours is the onlyChurch where the sceptic stands at the altar, and where St. Thomasis regarded as the ideal apostle. Many a worthy clergyman, whopasses his life in admirable works of kindly charity, lives anddies unnoticed and unknown; but it is sufficient for some shallowuneducated passman out of either University to get up in his pulpitand express his doubts about Noah's ark, or Balaam's ass, or Jonahand the whale, for half of London to flock to hear him, and to sitopen-mouthed in rapt admiration at his superb intellect. Thegrowth of common sense in the English Church is a thing very muchto be regretted. It is really a degrading concession to a low formof realism. It is silly, too. It springs from an entire ignoranceof psychology. Man can believe the impossible, but man can neverbelieve the improbable. However, I must read the end of myarticle:-'What we have to do, what at any rate it is our duty to do, is torevive this old art of Lying. Much of course may be done, in theway of educating the public, by amateurs in the domestic circle, atliterary lunches, and at afternoon teas. But this is merely thelight and graceful side of lying, such as was probably heard atCretan dinner-parties. There are many other forms. Lying for thesake of gaining some immediate personal advantage, for instance--lying with a moral purpose, as it is usually called--though of lateit has been rather looked down upon, was extremely popular with theantique world. Athena laughs when Odysseus tells her "his words ofsly devising," as Mr. William Morris phrases it, and the glory ofmendacity illumines the pale brow of the stainless hero ofEuripidean tragedy, and sets among the noble women of the past theyoung bride of one of Horace's most exquisite odes. Later on, whatat first had been merely a natural instinct was elevated into aself-conscious science. Elaborate rules were laid down for theguidance of mankind, and an important school of literature grew upround the subject. Indeed, when one remembers the excellentphilosophical treatise of Sanchez on the whole question, one cannothelp regretting that no one has ever thought of publishing a cheapand condensed edition of the works of that great casuist. A shortprimer, "When to Lie and How," if brought out in an attractive andnot too expensive a form, would no doubt command a large sale, andwould prove of real practical service to many earnest and deep-thinking people. Lying for the sake of the improvement of theyoung, which is the basis of home education, still lingers amongstus, and its advantages are so admirably set forth in the earlybooks of Plato's Republic that it is unnecessary to dwell upon themhere. It is a mode of lying for which all good mothers havepeculiar capabilities, but it is capable of still furtherdevelopment, and has been sadly overlooked by the School Board.Lying for the sake of a monthly salary is of course well known inFleet Street, and the profession of a political leader-writer isnot without its advantages. But it is said to be a somewhat dulloccupation, and it certainly does not lead to much beyond a kind ofostentatious obscurity. The only form of lying that is absolutelybeyond reproach is lying for its own sake, and the highestdevelopment of this is, as we have already pointed out, Lying inArt. Just as those who do not love Plato more than Truth cannotpass beyond the threshold of the Academe, so those who do not loveBeauty more than Truth never know the inmost shrine of Art. Thesolid stolid British intellect lies in the desert sands like theSphinx in Flaubert's marvellous tale, and fantasy, La Chimere,dances round it, and calls to it with her false, flute-toned voice.It may not hear her now, but surely some day, when we are all boredto death with the commonplace character of modern fiction, it willhearken to her and try to borrow her wings.'And when that day dawns, or sunset reddens, how joyous we shallall be! Facts will be regarded as discreditable, Truth will befound mourning over her fetters, and Romance, with her temper ofwonder, will return to the land. The very aspect of the world willchange to our startled eyes. Out of the sea will rise Behemoth andLeviathan, and sail round the high-pooped galleys, as they do onthe delightful maps of those ages when books on geography wereactually readable. Dragons will wander about the waste places, andthe phoenix will soar from her nest of fire into the air. We shalllay our hands upon the basilisk, and see the jewel in the toad'shead. Champing his gilded oats, the Hippogriff will stand in ourstalls, and over our heads will float the Blue Bird singing ofbeautiful and impossible things, of things that are lovely and thatnever happen, of things that are not and that should be. Butbefore this comes to pass we must cultivate the lost art of Lying.'CYRIL. Then we must entirely cultivate it at once. But in orderto avoid making any error I want you to tell me briefly thedoctrines of the new aesthetics.VIVIAN. Briefly, then, they are these. Art never expressesanything but itself. It has an independent life, just as Thoughthas, and develops purely on its own lines. It is not necessarilyrealistic in an age of realism, nor spiritual in an age of faith.So far from being the creation of its time, it is usually in directopposition to it, and the only history that it preserves for us isthe history of its own progress. Sometimes it returns upon itsfootsteps, and revives some antique form, as happened in thearchaistic movement of late Greek Art, and in the pre-Raphaelitemovement of our own day. At other times it entirely anticipatesits age, and produces in one century work that it takes anothercentury to understand, to appreciate and to enjoy. In no case doesit reproduce its age. To pass from the art of a time to the timeitself is the great mistake that all historians commit.The second doctrine is this. All bad art comes from returning toLife and Nature, and elevating them into ideals. Life and Naturemay sometimes be used as part of Art's rough material, but beforethey are of any real service to art they must be translated intoartistic conventions. The moment Art surrenders its imaginativemedium it surrenders everything. As a method Realism is a completefailure, and the two things that every artist should avoid aremodernity of form and modernity of subject-matter. To us, who livein the nineteenth century, any century is a suitable subject forart except our own. The only beautiful things are the things thatdo not concern us. It is, to have the pleasure of quoting myself,exactly because Hecuba is nothing to us that her sorrows are sosuitable a motive for a tragedy. Besides, it is only the modernthat ever becomes old-fashioned. M. Zola sits down to give us apicture of the Second Empire. Who cares for the Second Empire now?It is out of date. Life goes faster than Realism, but Romanticismis always in front of Life.The third doctrine is that Life imitates Art far more than Artimitates Life. This results not merely from Life's imitativeinstinct, but from the fact that the self-conscious aim of Life isto find expression, and that Art offers it certain beautiful formsthrough which it may realise that energy. It is a theory that hasnever been put forward before, but it is extremely fruitful, andthrows an entirely new light upon the history of Art.It follows, as a corollary from this, that external Nature alsoimitates Art. The only effects that she can show us are effectsthat we have already seen through poetry, or in paintings. This isthe secret of Nature's charm, as well as the explanation ofNature's weakness.The final revelation is that Lying, the telling of beautiful untruethings, is the proper aim of Art. But of this I think I havespoken at sufficient length. And now let us go out on the terrace,where 'droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost,' while theevening star 'washes the dusk with silver.' At twilight naturebecomes a wonderfully suggestive effect, and is not withoutloveliness, though perhaps its chief use is to illustratequotations from the poets. Come! We have talked long enough.
