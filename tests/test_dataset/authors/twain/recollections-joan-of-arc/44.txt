Joan Hears News from Home
WE MOUNTED and rode, a spectacle to remember, a most noble display ofrich vestments and nodding plumes, and as we moved between the bankedmultitudes they sank down all along abreast of us as we advanced, likegrain before the reaper, and kneeling hailed with a rousing welcome theconsecrated King and his companion the Deliverer of France. But by and bywhen we had paraded about the chief parts of the city and were come nearto the end of our course, we being now approaching the Archbishop'spalace, one saw on the right, hard by the inn that is called the Zebra, astrange t--two men not kneeling but standing! Standing in the front rankof the kneelers; unconscious, transfixed, staring. Yes, and clothed inthe coarse garb of the peasantry, these two. Two halberdiers sprang atthem in a fury to teach them better manners; but just as they seized themJoan cried out "Forbear!" and slid from her saddle and flung her armsabout one of those peasants, calling him by all manner of endearingnames, and sobbing. For it was her father; and the other was her uncle,Laxart.
The news flew everywhere, and shouts of welcome were raised, and in justone little moment those two despised and unknown plebeians were becomefamous and popular and envied, and everybody was in a fever to get sightof them and be able to say, all their lives long, that they had seen thefather of Joan of Arc and the brother of her mother. How easy it was forher to do miracles like to this! She was like the sun; on whatsoever dimand humble object her rays fell, that thing was straightway drowned inglory.
All graciously the King said:
"Bring them to me."
And she brought them; she radiant with happiness and affection, theytrembling and scared, with their caps in their shaking hands; and therebefore all the world the King gave them his hand to kiss, while thepeople gazed in envy and admiration; and he said to old D'Arc:
"Give God thanks for that you are father to this child, this dispenser ofimmortalities. You who bear a name that will still live in the mouths ofmen when all the race of kings has been forgotten, it is not meet thatyou bare your head before the fleeting fames and dignities of aday--cover yourself!" And truly he looked right fine and princely when hesaid that. Then he gave order that the Bailly of Rheims be brought; andwhen he was come, and stood bent low and bare, the King said to him,"These two are guests of France;" and bade him use them hospitably.
I may as well say now as later, that Papa D'Arc and Laxart were stoppingin that little Zebra inn, and that there they remained. Finer quarterswere offered them by the Bailly, also public distinctions and braveentertainment; but they were frightened at these projects, they beingonly humble and ignorant peasants; so they begged off, and had peace.They could not have enjoyed such things. Poor souls, they did not evenknow what to do with their hands, and it took all their attention to keepfrom treading on them. The Bailly did the best he could in thecircumstances. He made the innkeeper place a whole floor at theirdisposal, and told him to provide everything they might desire, andcharge all to the city. Also the Bailly gave them a horse apiece andfurnishings; which so overwhelmed them with pride and delight andastonishment that they couldn't speak a word; for in their lives they hadnever dreamed of wealth like this, and could not believe, at first, thatthe horses were real and would not dissolve to a mist and blow away. Theycould not unglue their minds from those grandeurs, and were alwayswrenching the conversation out of its groove and dragging the matter ofanimals into it, so that they could say "my horse" here, and "my horse"there and yonder and all around, and taste the words and lick their chopsover them, and spread their legs and hitch their thumbs in their armpits,and feel as the good God feels when He looks out on His fleets ofconstellations plowing the awful deeps of space and reflects withsatisfaction that they are His--all His. Well, they were the happiest oldchildren one ever saw, and the simplest.
The city gave a grand banquet to the King and Joan in mid-afternoon, andto the Court and the Grand Staff; and about the middle of it Pere D'Arcand Laxart were sent for, but would not venture until it was promisedthat they might sit in a gallery and be all by themselves and see allthat was to be seen and yet be unmolested. And so they sat there andlooked down upon the splendid spectacle, and were moved till the tearsran down their cheeks to see the unbelievable honors that were paid totheir small darling, and how naively serene and unafraid she sat therewith those consuming glories beating upon her.
But at last her serenity was broken up. Yes, it stood the strain of theKing's gracious speech; and of D'Alencon's praiseful words, and theBastard's; and even La Hire's thunder-blast, which took the place bystorm; but at last, as I have said, they brought a force to bear whichwas too strong for her. For at the close the King put up his hand tocommand silence, and so waited, with his hand up, till every sound wasdead and it was as if one could almost the stillness, so profound itwas. Then out of some remote corner of that vast place there rose aplaintive voice, and in tones most tender and sweet and rich camefloating through that enchanted hush our poor old simple song "L'ArbreFee Bourlemont!" and then Joan broke down and put her face in her handsand cried. Yes, you see, all in a moment the pomps and grandeursdissolved away and she was a little child again herding her sheep withthe tranquil pastures stretched about her, and war and wounds and bloodand death and the mad frenzy and turmoil of battle a dream. Ah, thatshows you the power of music, that magician of magicians, who lifts hiswand and says his mysterious word and all things real pass away and thephantoms of your mind walk before you clothed in flesh.
That was the King's invention, that sweet and dear surprise. Indeed, hehad fine things hidden away in his nature, though one seldom got aglimpse of them, with that scheming Tremouille and those others alwaysstanding in the light, and he so indolently content to save himself fussand argument and let them have their way.
At the fall of night we the Domremy contingent of the personal staff werewith the father and uncle at the inn, in their private parlor, brewinggenerous drinks and breaking ground for a homely talk about Domremy andthe neighbors, when a large parcel arrived from Joan to be kept till shecame; and soon she came herself and sent her guard away, saying she wouldtake one of her father's rooms and sleep under his roof, and so be athome again. We of the staff rose and stood, as was meet, until she madeus sit. Then she turned and saw that the two old men had gotten up too,and were standing in an embarrassed and unmilitary way; which made herwant to laugh, but she kept it in, as not wishing to hurt them; and gotthem to their seats and snuggled down between them, and took a hand ofeach of them upon her knees and nestled her own hands in them, and said:
"Now we will nave no more ceremony, but be kin and playmates as in othertimes; for I am done with the great wars now, and you two will take mehome with you, and I shall see--" She stopped, and for a moment her happyface sobered, as if a doubt or a presentiment had flitted through hermind; then it cleared again, and she said, with a passionate yearning,"Oh, if the day were but come and we could start!"
The old father was surprised, and said:
"Why, child, are you in earnest? Would you leave doing these wonders thatmake you to be praised by everybody while there is still so much glory tobe won; and would you go out from this grand comradeship with princes andgenerals to be a drudging villager again and a nobody? It is notrational."
"No," said the uncle, Laxart, "it is amazing to hear, and indeed notunderstandable. It is a stranger thing to hear her say she will stop thesoldiering that it was to hear her say she would begin it; and I whospeak to you can say in all truth that that was the strangest word thatever I had heard till this day and hour. I would it could be explained."
"It is not difficult," said Joan. "I was not ever fond of wounds andsuffering, nor fitted by my nature to inflict them; and quarrelings didalways distress me, and noise and tumult were against my liking, mydisposition being toward peace and quietness, and love for all thingsthat have life; and being made like this, how could I bear to think ofwars and blood, and the pain that goes with them, and the sorrow andmourning that follow after? But by his angels God laid His great commandsupon me, and could I disobey? I did as I was bid. Did He command me to domany things? No; only two: to raise the siege of Orleans, and crown theKing at Rheims. The task is finished, and I am free. Has ever a poorsoldier fallen in my sight, whether friend or foe, and I not felt thepain in my own body, and the grief of his home-mates in my own heart? No,not one; and, oh, it is such bliss to know that my release is won, andthat I shall not any more see these cruel things or suffer these torturesof the mind again! Then why should I not go to my village and be as I wasbefore? It is heaven! and ye wonder that I desire it. Ah, ye aremen--just men! My mother would understand."
They didn't quite know what to say; so they sat still awhile, lookingpretty vacant. Then old D'Arc said:
"Yes, your mother--that is true. I never saw such a woman. She worries,and worries, and worries; and wakes nights, and lies so, thinking--thatis, worrying; worrying about you. And when the night storms go ragingalong, she moans and says, 'Ah, God pity her, she is out in this with herpoor wet soldiers.' And when the lightning glares and the thunder crashesshe wrings her hands and trembles, saying, 'It is like the awful cannonand the flash, and yonder somewhere she is riding down upon the spoutingguns and I not there to protect her."
"Ah, poor mother, it is pity, it is pity!"
"Yes, a most strange woman, as I have noticed a many times. When there isnews of a victory and all the village goes mad with pride and joy, sherushes here and there in a maniacal frenzy till she finds out the oneonly thing she cares to know--that you are safe; then down she goes onher knees in the dirt and praises God as long as there is any breath leftin her body; and all on your account, for she never mentions the battleonce. And always she says, 'Now it is over--now France is saved--now shewill come home'--and always is disappointed and goes about mourning."
"Don't, father! it breaks my heart. I will be so good to her when I gethome. I will do her work for her, and be her comfort, and she shall notsuffer any more through me."
There was some more talk of this sort, then Uncle Laxart said:
"You have done the will of God, dear, and are quits; it is true, and nonemay deny it; but what of the King? You are his best soldier; what if hecommand you to stay?"
That was a crusher--and sudden! It took Joan a moment or two to recoverfrom the shock of it; then she said, quite simply and resignedly:
"The King is my Lord; I am his servant." She was silent and thoughtful alittle while, then she brightened up and said, cheerily, "But let usdrive such thoughts away--this is no time for them. Tell me about home."
So the two old gossips talked and talked; talked about everything andeverybody in the village; and it was good to hear. Joan out of herkindness tried to get us into the conversation, but that failed, ofcourse. She was the Commander-in-Chief, we were nobodies; her name wasthe mightiest in France, we were invisible atoms; she was the comrade ofprinces and heroes, we of the humble and obscure; she held rank above allPersonages and all Puissances whatsoever in the whole earth, by right ofbaring her commission direct from God. To put it in one word, she wasJOAN OF ARC--and when that is said, all is said. To us she was divine.Between her and us lay the bridgeless abyss which that word implies. Wecould not be familiar with her. No, you can see yourselves that thatwould have been impossible.
And yet she was so human, too, and so good and kind and dear and lovingand cheery and charming and unspoiled and unaffected! Those are all thewords I think of now, but they are not enough; no, they are too few andcolorless and meager to tell it all, or tell the half. Those simple oldmen didn't realize her; they couldn't; they had never known any peoplebut human beings, and so they had no other standard to measure her by. Tothem, after their first little shyness had worn off, she was just agirl--that was all. It was amazing. It made one shiver, sometimes, to seehow calm and easy and comfortable they were in her presence, and hearthem talk to her exactly as they would have talked to any other girl inFrance.
Why, that simple old Laxart sat up there and droned out the most tediousand empty tale one ever heard, and neither he nor Papa D'Arc ever gave athought to the badness of the etiquette of it, or ever suspected thatthat foolish tale was anything but dignified and valuable history. Therewas not an atom of value in it; and whilst they thought it distressingand pathetic, it was in fact not pathetic at all, but actuallyridiculous. At least it seemed so to me, and it seems so yet. Indeed, Iknow it was, because it made Joan laugh; and the more sorrowful it gotthe more it made her laugh; and the Paladin said that he could havelaughed himself if she had not been there, and Noel Rainguesson said thesame. It was about old Laxart going to a funeral there at Domremy two orthree weeks back. He had spots all over his face and hands, and he gotJoan to rub some healing ointment on them, and while she was doing it,and comforting him, and trying to say pitying things to him, he told herhow it happened. And first he asked her if she remembered that black bullcalf that she left behind when she came away, and she said indeed shedid, and he was a dear, and she loved him so, and was he well?--and justdrowned him in questions about that creature. And he said it was a youngbull now, and very frisky; and he was to bear a principal hand at afuneral; and she said, "The bull?" and he said, "No, myself"; but saidthe bull did take a hand, but not because of his being invited, for hewasn't; but anyway he was away over beyond the Fairy Tree, and fellasleep on the grass with his Sunday funeral clothes on, and a long blackrag on his hat and hanging down his back; and when he woke he saw by thesun how late it was, and not a moment to lose; and jumped up terriblyworried, and saw the young bull grazing there, and thought maybe he couldride part way on him and gain time; so he tied a rope around the bull'sbody to hold on by, and put a halter on him to steer with, and jumped onand started; but it was all new to the bull, and he was discontented withit, and scurried around and bellowed and reared and pranced, and UncleLaxart was satisfied, and wanted to get off and go by the next bull orsome other way that was quieter, but he didn't dare try; and it wasgetting very warm for him, too, and disturbing and wearisome, and notproper for Sunday; but by and by the bull lost all his temper, and wenttearing down the slope with his tail in the air and blowing in the mostawful way; and just in the edge of the village he knocked down somebeehives, and the bees turned out and joined the excursion, and soaredalong in a black cloud that nearly hid those other two from sight, andprodded them both, and jabbed them and speared them and spiked them, andmade them bellow and shriek, and shriek and bellow; and here they cameroaring through the village like a hurricane, and took the funeralprocession right in the center, and sent that section of it sprawling,and galloped over it, and the rest scattered apart and fled screeching inevery direction, every person with a layer of bees on him, and not a ragof that funeral left but the corpse; and finally the bull broke for theriver and jumped in, and when they fished Uncle Laxart out he was nearlydrowned, and his face looked like a pudding with raisins in it. And thenhe turned around, this old simpleton, and looked a long time in a dazedway at Joan where she had her face in a cushion, dying, apparently, andsays:
"What do you reckon she is laughing at?"
And old D'Arc stood looking at her the same way, sort of absentlyscratching his head; but had to give it up, and said he didn'tknow--"must have been something that happened when we weren't noticing."
Yes, both of those old people thought that that tale was pathetic;whereas to my mind it was purely ridiculous, and not in any way valuableto any one. It seemed so to me then, and it seems so to me yet. And asfor history, it does not resemble history; for the office of history isto furnish serious and important facts that teach; whereas this strangeand useless event teaches nothing; nothing that I can see, except not toride a bull to a funeral; and surely no reflecting person needs to betaught that.
