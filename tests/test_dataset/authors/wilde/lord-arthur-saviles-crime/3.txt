When Lord Arthur woke it was twelve o'clock, and the midday sun wasstreaming through the ivory-silk curtains of his room. He got upand looked out of the window. A dim haze of heat was hanging overthe great city, and the roofs of the houses were like dull silver.In the flickering green of the square below some children wereflitting about like white butterflies, and the pavement was crowdedwith people on their way to the Park. Never had life seemedlovelier to him, never had the things of evil seemed more remote.
Then his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray. After hehad drunk it, he drew aside a heavy portiere of peach-colouredplush, and passed into the bathroom. The light stole softly fromabove, through thin slabs of transparent onyx, and the water in themarble tank glimmered like a moonstone. He plunged hastily in, tillthe cool ripples touched throat and hair, and then dipped his headright under, as though he would have wiped away the stain of someshameful memory. When he stepped out he felt almost at peace. Theexquisite physical conditions of the moment had dominated him, asindeed often happens in the case of very finely-wrought natures, forthe senses, like fire, can purify as well as destroy.
After breakfast, he flung himself down on a divan, and lit acigarette. On the mantel-shelf, framed in dainty old brocade, stooda large photograph of Sybil Merton, as he had seen her first at LadyNoel's ball. The small, exquisitely-shaped head drooped slightly toone side, as though the thin, reed-like throat could hardly bear theburden of so much beauty; the lips were slightly parted, and seemedmade for sweet music; and all the tender purity of girlhood lookedout in wonder from the dreaming eyes. With her soft, clinging dressof crepe-de-chine, and her large leaf-shaped fan, she looked likeone of those delicate little figures men find in the olive-woodsnear Tanagra; and there was a touch of Greek grace in her pose andattitude. Yet she was not petite. She was simply perfectlyproportioned--a rare thing in an age when so many women are eitherover life-size or insignificant.
Now as Lord Arthur looked at her, he was filled with the terriblepity that is born of love. He felt that to marry her, with the doomof murder hanging over his head, would be a betrayal like that ofJudas, a sin worse than any the Borgia had ever dreamed of. Whathappiness could there be for them, when at any moment he might becalled upon to carry out the awful prophecy written in his hand?What manner of life would be theirs while Fate still held thisfearful fortune in the scales? The marriage must be postponed, atall costs. Of this he was quite resolved. Ardently though he lovedthe girl, and the mere touch of her fingers, when they sat together,made each nerve of his body thrill with exquisite joy, he recognisednone the less clearly where his duty lay, and was fully conscious ofthe fact that he had no right to marry until he had committed themurder. This done, he could stand before the altar with SybilMerton, and give his life into her hands without terror ofwrongdoing. This done, he could take her to his arms, knowing thatshe would never have to blush for him, never have to hang her headin shame. But done it must be first; and the sooner the better forboth.
Many men in his position would have preferred the primrose path ofdalliance to the steep heights of duty; but Lord Arthur was tooconscientious to set pleasure above principle. There was more thanmere passion in his love; and Sybil was to him a symbol of all thatis good and noble. For a moment he had a natural repugnance againstwhat he was asked to do, but it soon passed away. His heart toldhim that it was not a sin, but a sacrifice; his reason reminded himthat there was no other course open. He had to choose betweenliving for himself and living for others, and terrible though thetask laid upon him undoubtedly was, yet he knew that he must notsuffer selfishness to triumph over love. Sooner or later we are allcalled upon to decide on the same issue--of us all, the samequestion is asked. To Lord Arthur it came early in life--before hisnature had been spoiled by the calculating cynicism of middle-age,or his heart corroded by the shallow, fashionable egotism of ourday, and he felt no hesitation about doing his duty. Fortunatelyalso, for him, he was no mere dreamer, or idle dilettante. Had hebeen so, he would have hesitated, like Hamlet, and let irresolutionmar his purpose. But he was essentially practical. Life to himmeant action, rather than thought. He had that rarest of allthings, common sense.
The wild, turbid feelings of the previous night had by this timecompletely passed away, and it was almost with a sense of shame thathe looked back upon his mad wanderings from street to street, hisfierce emotional agony. The very sincerity of his sufferings madethem seem unreal to him now. He wondered how he could have been sofoolish as to rant and rave about the inevitable. The only questionthat seemed to trouble him was, whom to make away with; for he wasnot blind to the fact that murder, like the religions of the Paganworld, requires a victim as well as a priest. Not being a genius,he had no enemies, and indeed he felt that this was not the time forthe gratification of any personal pique or dislike, the mission inwhich he was engaged being one of great and grave solemnity. Heaccordingly made out a list of his friends and relatives on a sheetof notepaper, and after careful consideration, decided in favour ofLady Clementina Beauchamp, a dear old lady who lived in CurzonStreet, and was his own second cousin by his mother's side. He hadalways been very fond of Lady Clem, as every one called her, and ashe was very wealthy himself, having come into all Lord Rugby'sproperty when he came of age, there was no possibility of hisderiving any vulgar monetary advantage by her death. In fact, themore he thought over the matter, the more she seemed to him to bejust the right person, and, feeling that any delay would be unfairto Sybil, he determined to make his arrangements at once.
The first thing to be done was, of course, to settle with thecheiromantist; so he sat down at a small Sheraton writing-table thatstood near the window, drew a cheque for 105 pounds, payable to theorder of Mr. Septimus Podgers, and, enclosing it in an envelope,told his valet to take it to West Moon Street. He then telephonedto the stables for his hansom, and dressed to go out. As he wasleaving the room he looked back at Sybil Merton's photograph, andswore that, come what may, he would never let her know what he wasdoing for her sake, but would keep the secret of his self-sacrificehidden always in his heart.
On his way to the Buckingham, he stopped at a florist's, and sentSybil a beautiful basket of narcissus, with lovely white petals andstaring pheasants' eyes, and on arriving at the club, went straightto the library, rang the bell, and ordered the waiter to bring him alemon-and-soda, and a book on Toxicology. He had fully decided thatpoison was the best means to adopt in this troublesome business.Anything like personal violence was extremely distasteful to him,and besides, he was very anxious not to murder Lady Clementina inany way that might attract public attention, as he hated the idea ofbeing lionised at Lady Windermere's, or seeing his name figuring inthe paragraphs of vulgar society--newspapers. He had also to thinkof Sybil's father and mother, who were rather old-fashioned people,and might possibly object to the marriage if there was anything likea scandal, though he felt certain that if he told them the wholefacts of the case they would be the very first to appreciate themotives that had actuated him. He had every reason, then, to decidein favour of poison. It was safe, sure, and quiet, and did awaywith any necessity for painful scenes, to which, like mostEnglishmen, he had a rooted objection.
Of the science of poisons, however, he knew absolutely nothing, andas the waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the librarybut Ruff's Guide and Bailey's Magazine, he examined the book-shelveshimself, and finally came across a handsomely-bound edition of thePharmacopoeia, and a copy of Erskine's Toxicology, edited by SirMathew Reid, the President of the Royal College of Physicians, andone of the oldest members of the Buckingham, having been elected inmistake for somebody else; a contretemps that so enraged theCommittee, that when the real man came up they black-balled himunanimously. Lord Arthur was a good deal puzzled at the technicalterms used in both books, and had begun to regret that he had notpaid more attention to his classics at Oxford, when in the secondvolume of Erskine, he found a very interesting and complete accountof the properties of aconitine, written in fairly clear English. Itseemed to him to be exactly the poison he wanted. It was swift--indeed, almost immediate, in its effect--perfectly painless, andwhen taken in the form of a gelatine capsule, the mode recommendedby Sir Mathew, not by any means unpalatable. He accordingly made anote, upon his shirt-cuff, of the amount necessary for a fatal dose,put the books back in their places, and strolled up St. James'sStreet, to Pestle and Humbey's, the great chemists. Mr. Pestle, whoalways attended personally on the aristocracy, was a good dealsurprised at the order, and in a very deferential manner murmuredsomething about a medical certificate being necessary. However, assoon as Lord Arthur explained to him that it was for a largeNorwegian mastiff that he was obliged to get rid of, as it showedsigns of incipient rabies, and had already bitten the coachman twicein the calf of the leg, he expressed himself as being perfectlysatisfied, complimented Lord Arthur on his wonderful knowledge ofToxicology, and had the prescription made up immediately.
Lord Arthur put the capsule into a pretty little silver bonbonnierethat he saw in a shop window in Bond Street, threw away Pestle andHambey's ugly pill-box, and drove off at once to Lady Clementina's.
'Well, monsieur le mauvais sujet,' cried the old lady, as he enteredthe room, 'why haven't you been to see me all this time?'
'My dear Lady Clem, I never have a moment to myself,' said LordArthur, smiling.
'I suppose you mean that you go about all day long with Miss SybilMerton, buying chiffons and talking nonsense? I cannot understandwhy people make such a fuss about being married. In my day we neverdreamed of billing and cooing in public, or in private for thatmatter.'
'I assure you I have not seen Sybil for twenty-four hours, LadyClem. As far as I can make out, she belongs entirely to hermilliners.'
'Of course; that is the only reason you come to see an ugly oldwoman like myself. I wonder you men don't take warning. On a faitdes folies pour moi, and here I am, a poor rheumatic creature, witha false front and a bad temper. Why, if it were not for dear LadyJansen, who sends me all the worst French novels she can find, Idon't think I could get through the day. Doctors are no use at all,except to get fees out of one. They can't even cure my heartburn.'
'I have brought you a cure for that, Lady Clem,' said Lord Arthurgravely. 'It is a wonderful thing, invented by an American.'
'I don't think I like American inventions, Arthur. I am quite sureI don't. I read some American novels lately, and they were quitenonsensical.'
'Oh, but there is no nonsense at all about this, Lady Clem! Iassure you it is a perfect cure. You must promise to try it'; andLord Arthur brought the little box out of his pocket, and handed itto her.
'Well, the box is charming, Arthur. Is it really a present? Thatis very sweet of you. And is this the wonderful medicine? It lookslike a bonbon. I'll take it at once.'
'Good heavens! Lady Clem,' cried Lord Arthur, catching hold of herhand, 'you mustn't do anything of the kind. It is a homoeopathicmedicine, and if you take it without having heartburn, it might doyou no end of harm. Wait till you have an attack, and take it then.You will be astonished at the result.'
'I should like to take it now,' said Lady Clementina, holding up tothe light the little transparent capsule, with its floating bubbleof liquid aconitine. I am sure it is delicious. The fact is that,though I hate doctors, I love medicines. However, I'll keep it tillmy next attack.'
'And when will that be?' asked Lord Arthur eagerly. 'Will it besoon?'
'I hope not for a week. I had a very bad time yesterday morningwith it. But one never knows.'
'You are sure to have one before the end of the month then, LadyClem?'
'I am afraid so. But how sympathetic you are to-day, Arthur!Really, Sybil has done you a great deal of good. And now you mustrun away, for I am dining with some very dull people, who won't talkscandal, and I know that if I don't get my sleep now I shall neverbe able to keep awake during dinner. Good-bye, Arthur, give my loveto Sybil, and thank you so much for the American medicine.'
'You won't forget to take it, Lady Clem, will you?' said LordArthur, rising from his seat.
'Of course I won't, you silly boy. I think it is most kind of youto think of me, and I shall write and tell you if I want any more.'
Lord Arthur left the house in high spirits, and with a feeling ofimmense relief.
That night he had an interview with Sybil Merton. He told her howhe had been suddenly placed in a position of terrible difficulty,from which neither honour nor duty would allow him to recede. Hetold her that the marriage must be put off for the present, as untilhe had got rid of his fearful entanglements, he was not a free man.He implored her to trust him, and not to have any doubts about thefuture. Everything would come right, but patience was necessary.
The scene took place in the conservatory of Mr. Merton's house, inPark Lane, where Lord Arthur had dined as usual. Sybil had neverseemed more happy, and for a moment Lord Arthur had been tempted toplay the coward's part, to write to Lady Clementina for the pill,and to let the marriage go on as if there was no such person as Mr.Podgers in the world. His better nature, however, soon asserteditself, and even when Sybil flung herself weeping into his arms, hedid not falter. The beauty that stirred his senses had touched hisconscience also. He felt that to wreck so fair a life for the sakeof a few months' pleasure would be a wrong thing to do.
He stayed with Sybil till nearly midnight, comforting her and beingcomforted in turn, and early the next morning he left for Venice,after writing a manly, firm letter to Mr. Merton about the necessarypostponement of the marriage.
