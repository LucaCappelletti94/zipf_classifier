The Gods are dead: no longer do we bringTo grey-eyed Pallas crowns of olive-leaves!Demeter's child no more hath tithe of sheaves,And in the noon the careless shepherds sing,For Pan is dead, and all the wantoningBy secret glade and devious haunt is o'er:Young Hylas seeks the water-springs no more;Great Pan is dead, and Mary's son is King.
And yet--perchance in this sea-tranced isle,Chewing the bitter fruit of memory,Some God lies hidden in the asphodel.Ah Love! if such there be, then it were wellFor us to fly his anger: nay, but see,The leaves are stirring: let us watch awhile.
CORFU.
