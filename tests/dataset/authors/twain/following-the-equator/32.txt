The man with a new idea is a Crank until the idea succeeds. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
It was Junior England all the way to Christchurch--in fact, just agarden. And Christchurch is an English town, with an English-park annex,and a winding English brook just like the Avon--and named the Avon; butfrom a man, not from Shakespeare's river. Its grassy banks are borderedby the stateliest and most impressive weeping willows to be found in theworld, I suppose. They continue the line of a great ancestor; they weregrown from sprouts of the willow that sheltered Napoleon's grave in St.Helena. It is a settled old community, with all the serenities, thegraces, the conveniences, and the comforts of the ideal home-life. If ithad an established Church and social inequality it would be England overagain with hardly a lack.
In the museum we saw many curious and interesting things; among others afine native house of the olden time, with all the details true to thefacts, and the showy colors right and in their proper places. All thedetails: the fine mats and rugs and things; the elaborate and wonderfulwood carvings--wonderful, surely, considering who did them wonderful indesign and particularly in execution, for they were done with admirablesharpness and exactness, and yet with no better tools than flint and jadeand shell could furnish; and the totem-posts were there, ancestor aboveancestor, with tongues protruded and hands clasped comfortably overbellies containing other people's ancestors--grotesque and ugly devils,every one, but lovingly carved, and ably; and the stuffed natives werepresent, in their proper places, and looking as natural as life; and thehousekeeping utensils were there, too, and close at hand the carved andfinely ornamented war canoe.
And we saw little jade gods, to hang around the neck--not everybody's,but sacred to the necks of natives of rank. Also jade weapons, and manykinds of jade trinkets--all made out of that excessively hard stonewithout the help of any tool of iron. And some of these things had smallround holes bored through them--nobody knows how it was done; a mystery,a lost art. I think it was said that if you want such a hole bored in apiece of jade now, you must send it to London or Amsterdam where thelapidaries are.
Also we saw a complete skeleton of the giant Moa. It stood ten feethigh, and must have been a sight to look at when it was a living bird.It was a kicker, like the ostrich; in fight it did not use its beak, butits foot. It must have been a convincing kind of kick. If a person hadhis back to the bird and did not see who it was that did it, he wouldthink he had been kicked by a wind-mill.
There must have been a sufficiency of moas in the old forgotten days whenhis breed walked the earth. His bones are found in vast masses, allcrammed together in huge graves. They are not in caves, but in theground. Nobody knows how they happened to get concentrated there. Mind,they are bones, not fossils. This means that the moa has not beenextinct very long. Still, this is the only New Zealand creature whichhas no mention in that otherwise comprehensive literature, the nativelegends. This is a significant detail, and is good circumstantialevidence that the moa has been extinct 500 years, since the Maori hashimself--by tradition--been in New Zealand since the end of the fifteenthcentury. He came from an unknown land--the first Maori did--then sailedback in his canoe and brought his tribe, and they removed the aboriginalpeoples into the sea and into the ground and took the land. That is thetradition. That that first Maori could come, is understandable, foranybody can come to a place when he isn't trying to; but how thatdiscoverer found his way back home again without a compass is his secret,and he died with it in him. His language indicates that he came fromPolynesia. He told where he came from, but he couldn't spell well, soone can't find the place on the map, because people who could spellbetter than he could, spelt the resemblance all out of it when they madethe map. However, it is better to have a map that is spelt right thanone that has information in it.
In New Zealand women have the right to vote for members of thelegislature, but they cannot be members themselves. The law extendingthe suffrage to them event into effect in 1893. The population ofChristchurch (census of 1891) was 31,454. The first election under thelaw was held in November of that year. Number of men who voted, 6,313;number of women who voted, 5,989. These figures ought to convince usthat women are not as indifferent about politics as some people wouldhave us believe. In New Zealand as a whole, the estimated adult femalepopulation was 139,915; of these 109,461 qualified and registered theirnames on the rolls 78.23 per cent. of the whole. Of these, 90,290 wentto the polls and voted--85.18 per cent. Do men ever turn out better thanthat--in America or elsewhere? Here is a remark to the other sex'scredit, too--I take it from the official report:
"A feature of the election was the orderliness and sobriety of thepeople. Women were in no way molested."
At home, a standing argument against woman suffrage has always been thatwomen could not go to the polls without being insulted. The argumentsagainst woman suffrage have always taken the easy form of prophecy. Theprophets have been prophesying ever since the woman's rights movementbegan in 1848--and in forty-seven years they have never scored a hit.
Men ought to begin to feel a sort of respect for their mothers and wivesand sisters by this time. The women deserve a change of attitude likethat, for they have wrought well. In forty-seven years they have sweptan imposingly large number of unfair laws from the statute books ofAmerica. In that brief time these serfs have set themselves freeessentially. Men could not have done so much for themselves in that timewithout bloodshed--at least they never have; and that is argument thatthey didn't know how. The women have accomplished a peaceful revolution,and a very beneficent one; and yet that has not convinced the average manthat they are intelligent, and have courage and energy and perseveranceand fortitude. It takes much to convince the average man of anything;and perhaps nothing can ever make him realize that he is the averagewoman's inferior--yet in several important details the evidences seems toshow that that is what he is. Man has ruled the human race from thebeginning--but he should remember that up to the middle of the presentcentury it was a dull world, and ignorant and stupid; but it is not sucha dull world now, and is growing less and less dull all the time. Thisis woman's opportunity--she has had none before. I wonder where man willbe in another forty-seven years?
In the New Zealand law occurs this: "The word person wherever it occursthroughout the Act includes woman."
That is promotion, you see. By that enlargement of the word, the matronwith the garnered wisdom and experience of fifty years becomes at onejump the political equal of her callow kid of twenty-one. The whitepopulation of the colony is 626,000, the Maori population is 42,000. Thewhites elect seventy members of the House of Representatives, the Maorisfour. The Maori women vote for their four members.
November 16. After four pleasant days in Christchurch, we are to leaveat midnight to-night. Mr. Kinsey gave me an ornithorhynchus, and I amtaming it.
Sunday, 17th. Sailed last night in the Flora, from Lyttelton.
So we did. I remember it yet. The people who sailed in the Flora thatnight may forget some other things if they live a good while, but theywill not live long, enough to forget that. The Flora is about theequivalent of a cattle-scow; but when the Union Company find itinconvenient to keep a contract and lucrative to break it, they smuggleher into passenger service, and "keep the change."
They give no notice of their projected depredation; you innocently buytickets for the advertised passenger boat, and when you get down toLyttelton at midnight, you find that they have substituted the scow.They have plenty of good boats, but no competition--and that is thetrouble. It is too late now to make other arrangements if you haveengagements ahead.
It is a powerful company, it has a monopoly, and everybody is afraid ofit--including the government's representative, who stands at the end ofthe stage-plank to tally the passengers and see that no boat receives agreater number than the law allows her to carry. This conveniently-blindrepresentative saw the scow receive a number which was far in excess ofits privilege, and winked a politic wink and said nothing. Thepassengers bore with meekness the cheat which had been put upon them, andmade no complaint.
It was like being at home in America, where abused passengers act in justthe same way. A few days before, the Union Company had discharged acaptain for getting a boat into danger, and had advertised this act asevidence of its vigilance in looking after the safety of the passengers--for thugging a captain costs the company nothing, but when opportunityoffered to send this dangerously overcrowded tub to sea and save a littletrouble and a tidy penny by it, it forgot to worry about the passenger'ssafety.
The first officer told me that the Flora was privileged to carry 125passengers. She must have had all of 200 on board. All the cabins werefull, all the cattle-stalls in the main stable were full, the spaces atthe heads of companionways were full, every inch of floor and table inthe swill-room was packed with sleeping men and remained so until theplace was required for breakfast, all the chairs and benches on thehurricane deck were occupied, and still there were people who had to walkabout all night!
If the Flora had gone down that night, half of the people on board wouldhave been wholly without means of escape.
The owners of that boat were not technically guilty of conspiracy tocommit murder, but they were morally guilty of it.
I had a cattle-stall in the main stable--a cavern fitted up with a longdouble file of two-storied bunks, the files separated by a calicopartition--twenty men and boys on one side of it, twenty women and girlson the other. The place was as dark as the soul of the Union Company,and smelt like a kennel. When the vessel got out into the heavy seas andbegan to pitch and wallow, the cavern prisoners became immediatelyseasick, and then the peculiar results that ensued laid all my previousexperiences of the kind well away in the shade. And the wails, thegroans, the cries, the shrieks, the strange ejaculations--it waswonderful.
The women and children and some of the men and boys spent the night inthat place, for they were too ill to leave it; but the rest of us got up,by and by, and finished the night on the hurricane-deck.
That boat was the foulest I was ever in; and the smell of the breakfastsaloon when we threaded our way among the layers of steaming passengersstretched upon its floor and its tables was incomparable for efficiency.
A good many of us got ashore at the first way-port to seek another ship.After a wait of three hours we got good rooms in the Mahinapua, a weelittle bridal-parlor of a boat--only 205 tons burthen; clean andcomfortable; good service; good beds; good table, and no crowding. Theseas danced her about like a duck, but she was safe and capable.
Next morning early she went through the French Pass--a narrow gateway ofrock, between bold headlands--so narrow, in fact, that it seemed no widerthan a street. The current tore through there like a mill-race, and theboat darted through like a telegram. The passage was made in half aminute; then we were in a wide place where noble vast eddies sweptgrandly round and round in shoal water, and I wondered what they would dowith the little boat. They did as they pleased with her. They pickedher up and flung her around like nothing and landed her gently on thesolid, smooth bottom of sand--so gently, indeed, that we barely felt hertouch it, barely felt her quiver when she came to a standstill. Thewater was as clear as glass, the sand on the bottom was vividly distinct,and the fishes seemed to be swimming about in nothing. Fishing lineswere brought out, but before we could bait the hooks the boat was off andaway again.
