At Last--Forward!
THE DAYS began to waste away--and nothing decided, nothing done. The armywas full of zeal, but it was also hungry. It got no pay, the treasury wasgetting empty, it was becoming impossible to feed it; under pressure ofprivation it began to fall apart and disperse--which pleased the triflingcourt exceedingly. Joan's distress was pitiful to see. She was obliged tostand helpless while her victorious army dissolved away until hardly theskeleton of it was left.
At last one day she went to the Castle of Loches, where the King wasidling. She found him consulting with three of his councilors, Robert leMaÂ‡on, a former Chancellor of France, Christophe d'Harcourt, and GerardMachet. The Bastard of Orleans was present also, and it is through himthat we know what happened. Joan threw herself at the King's feet andembraced his knees, saying:
"Noble Dauphin, prithee hold no more of these long and numerous councils,but come, and come quickly, to Rheims and receive your crown."
Christophe d'Harcourt asked:
"Is it your Voices that command you to say that to the King?"
"Yes, and urgently."
"Then will you not tell us in the King's presence in what way the Voicescommunicate with you?"
It was another sly attempt to trap Joan into indiscreet admissions anddangerous pretensions. But nothing came of it. Joan's answer was simpleand straightforward, and the smooth Bishop was not able to find any faultwith it. She said that when she met with people who doubted the truth ofher mission she went aside and prayed, complaining of the distrust ofthese, and then the comforting Voices were heard at her ear saying, softand low, "Go forward, Daughter of God, and I will help thee." Then sheadded, "When I hear that, the joy in my heart, oh, it is insupportable!"
The Bastard said that when she said these words her face lit up as with aflame, and she was like one in an ecstasy.
Joan pleaded, persuaded, reasoned; gaining ground little by little, butopposed step by step by the council. She begged, she implored, leave tomarch. When they could answer nothing further, they granted that perhapsit had been a mistake to let the army waste away, but how could we helpit now? how could we march without an army?
"Raise one!" said Joan.
"But it will take six weeks."
"No matter--begin! let us begin!"
"It is too late. Without doubt the Duke of Bedford has been gatheringtroops to push to the succor of his strongholds on the Loire."
"Yes, while we have been disbanding ours--and pity 'tis. But we mustthrow away no more time; we must bestir ourselves."
The King objected that he could not venture toward Rheims with thosestrong places on the Loire in his path. But Joan said:
"We will break them up. Then you can march."
With that plan the King was willing to venture assent. He could sitaround out of danger while the road was being cleared.
Joan came back in great spirits. Straightway everything was stirring.Proclamations were issued calling for men, a recruiting-camp wasestablished at Selles in Berry, and the commons and the nobles began toflock to it with enthusiasm.
A deal of the month of May had been wasted; and yet by the 6th of JuneJoan had swept together a new army and was ready to march. She had eightthousand men. Think of that. Think of gathering together such a body asthat in that little region. And these were veteran soldiers, too. Infact, most of the men in France were soldiers, when you came to that; forthe wars had lasted generations now. Yes, most Frenchmen were soldiers;and admirable runners, too, both by practice and inheritance; they haddone next to nothing but run for near a century. But that was not theirfault. They had had no fair and proper leadership--at least leaders witha fair and proper chance. Away back, King and Court got the habit ofbeing treacherous to the leaders; then the leaders easily got the habitof disobeying the King and going their own way, each for himself andnobody for the lot. Nobody could win victories that way. Hence, runningbecame the habit of the French troops, and no wonder. Yet all that thosetroops needed in order to be good fighters was a leader who would attendstrictly to business--a leader with all authority in his hands in placeof a tenth of it along with nine other generals equipped with an equaltenth apiece. They had a leader rightly clothed with authority now, andwith a head and heart bent on war of the most intensely businesslike andearnest sort--and there would be results. No doubt of that. They had Joanof Arc; and under that leadership their legs would lose the art andmystery of running.
Yes, Joan was in great spirits. She was here and there and everywhere,all over the camp, by day and by night, pushing things. And wherever shecame charging down the lines, reviewing the troops, it was good to hearthem break out and cheer. And nobody could help cheering, she was such avision of young bloom and beauty and grace, and such an incarnation ofpluck and life and go! she was growing more and more ideally beautifulevery day, as was plain to be seen--and these were days of development;for she was well past seventeen now--in fact, she was getting close uponseventeen and a half--indeed, just a little woman, as you may say.
The two young Counts de Laval arrived one day--fine young fellows alliedto the greatest and most illustrious houses of France; and they could notrest till they had seen Joan of Arc. So the King sent for them andpresented them to her, and you may believe she filled the bill of theirexpectations. When they heard that rich voice of hers they must havethought it was a flute; and when they saw her deep eyes and her face, andthe soul that looked out of that face, you could see that the sight ofher stirred them like a poem, like lofty eloquence, like martial music.One of them wrote home to his people, and in his letter he said, "Itseemed something divine to see her and hear her." Ah, yes, and it was atrue word. Truer word was never spoken.
He saw her when she was ready to begin her march and open the campaign,and this is what he said about it:
"She was clothed all in white armor save her head, and in her hand shecarried a little battle-ax; and when she was ready to mount her greatblack horse he reared and plunged and would not let her. Then she said,'Lead him to the cross.' This cross was in front of the church close by.So they led him there. Then she mounted, and he never budged, any morethan if he had been tied. Then she turned toward the door of the churchand said, in her soft womanly voice, 'You, priests and people of theChurch, make processions and pray to God for us!' Then she spurred away,under her standard, with her little ax in her hand, crying'Forward--march!' One of her brothers, who came eight days ago, departedwith her; and he also was clad all in white armor."
I was there, and I saw it, too; saw it all, just as he pictures it. And Isee it yet--the little battle-ax, the dainty plumed cap, the whitearmor--all in the soft June afternoon; I see it just as if it wereyesterday. And I rode with the staff--the personal staff--the staff ofJoan of Arc.
That young count was dying to go, too, but the King held him back for thepresent. But Joan had made him a promise. In his letter he said:
"She told me that when the King starts for Rheims I shall go with him.But God grant I may not have to wait till then, but may have a part inthe battles!"
She made him that promise when she was taking leave of my lady theDuchess d'Alencon. The duchess was exacting a promise, so it seemed aproper time for others to do the like. The duchess was troubled for herhusband, for she foresaw desperate fighting; and she held Joan to herbreast, and stroked her hair lovingly, and said:
"You must watch over him, dear, and take care of him, and send him backto me safe. I require it of you; I will not let you go till you promise."
Joan said:
"I give you the promise with all my heart; and it is not just words, itis a promise; you shall have him back without a hurt. Do you believe? Andare you satisfied with me now?"
The duchess could not speak, but she kissed Joan on the forehead; and sothey parted.
We left on the 6th and stopped over at Romorantin; then on the 9th Joanentered Orleans in state, under triumphal arches, with the welcomingcannon thundering and seas of welcoming flags fluttering in the breeze.The Grand Staff rode with her, clothed in shining splendors of costumeand decorations: the Duke d'Alencon; the Bastard of Orleans; the Sire deBoussac, Marshal of France; the Lord de Granville, Master of theCrossbowmen; the Sire de Culan, Admiral of France; Ambroise de Lor;Etienne de Vignoles, called La Hire; Gautier de Brusac, and otherillustrious captains.
It was grand times; the usual shoutings and packed multitudes, the usualcrush to get sight of Joan; but at last we crowded through to our oldlodgings, and I saw old Boucher and the wife and that dear Catherinegather Joan to their hearts and smother her with kisses--and my heartached for her so! for I could have kissed Catherine better than anybody,and more and longer; yet was not thought of for that office, and I sofamished for it. Ah, she was so beautiful, and oh, so sweet! I had lovedher the first day I ever saw her, and from that day forth she was sacredto me. I have carried her image in my heart for sixty-three years--alllonely thee, yes, solitary, for it never has had company--and I am grownso old, so old; but it, oh, it is as fresh and young and merry andmischievous and lovely and sweet and pure and witching and divine as itwas when it crept in there, bringing benediction and peace to itshabitation so long ago, so long ago--for it has not aged a day!
