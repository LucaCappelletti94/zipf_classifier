O singer of Persephone!In the dim meadows desolateDost thou remember Sicily?
Still through the ivy flits the beeWhere Amaryllis lies in state;O Singer of Persephone!
Simaetha calls on HecateAnd hears the wild dogs at the gate;Dost thou remember Sicily?
Still by the light and laughing seaPoor Polypheme bemoans his fate;O Singer of Persephone!
And still in boyish rivalryYoung Daphnis challenges his mate;Dost thou remember Sicily?
Slim Lacon keeps a goat for thee,For thee the jocund shepherds wait;O Singer of Persephone!Dost thou remember Sicily?
