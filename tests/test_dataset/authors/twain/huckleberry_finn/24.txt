He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and hesoon struck it. He dressed Jim up in King Lear'soutfit -- it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a whitehorse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took histheater paint and painted Jim's face and hands andears and neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like aman that's been drownded nine days. Blamed if hewarn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see. Thenthe duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:
  Sick Arab -- but harmless when not out of his head.
And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood thelath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam. Jimwas satisfied. He said it was a sight better than lyingtied a couple of years every day, and trembling allover every time there was a sound. The duke toldhim to make himself free and easy, and if anybodyever come meddling around, he must hop out of thewigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or twolike a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light outand leave him alone. Which was sound enough judg-ment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn'twait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look likehe was dead, he looked considerable more than that.
These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again,because there was so much money in it, but theyjudged it wouldn't be safe, because maybe the newsmight a worked along down by this time. Theycouldn't hit no project that suited exactly; so at lastthe duke said he reckoned he'd lay off and work hisbrains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put upsomething on the Arkansaw village; and the king heallowed he would drop over to t'other village withoutany plan, but just trust in Providence to lead him theprofitable way -- meaning the devil, I reckon. Wehad all bought store clothes where we stopped last;and now the king put his'n on, and he told me to putmine on. I done it, of course. The king's duds wasall black, and he did look real swell and starchy. Inever knowed how clothes could change a body be-fore. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest oldrip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off his newwhite beaver and make a bow and do a smile, helooked that grand and good and pious that you'd sayhe had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was oldLeviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and Igot my paddle ready. There was a big steamboat lay-ing at the shore away up under the point, about threemile above the town -- been there a couple of hours,taking on freight. Says the king:
"Seein' how I'm dressed, I reckon maybe I betterarrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or someother big place. Go for the steamboat, Huckleberry;we'll come down to the village on her."
I didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take asteamboat ride. I fetched the shore a half a mileabove the village, and then went scooting along thebluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come toa nice innocent-looking young country jake setting ona log swabbing the sweat off of his face, for it waspowerful warm weather; and he had a couple of bigcarpet-bags by him.
"Run her nose in shore," says the king. I doneit. "Wher' you bound for, young man?"
"For the steamboat; going to Orleans."
"Git aboard," says the king. "Hold on a minute,my servant 'll he'p you with them bags. Jump outand he'p the gentleman, Adolphus" -- meaning me, Isee.
I done so, and then we all three started on again.The young chap was mighty thankful; said it wastough work toting his baggage such weather. Heasked the king where he was going, and the king toldhim he'd come down the river and landed at the othervillage this morning, and now he was going up a fewmile to see an old friend on a farm up there. Theyoung fellow says:
"When I first see you I says to myself, 'It's Mr.Wilks, sure, and he come mighty near getting here intime.' But then I says again, 'No, I reckon it ain'thim, or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river.'You AIN'T him, are you?"
"No, my name's Blodgett -- Elexander Blodgett --REVEREND Elexander Blodgett, I s'pose I must say, asI'm one o' the Lord's poor servants. But still I'mjist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arrivingin time, all the same, if he's missed anything by it --which I hope he hasn't."
"Well, he don't miss any property by it, becausehe'll get that all right; but he's missed seeing hisbrother Peter die -- which he mayn't mind, nobodycan tell as to that -- but his brother would a giveanything in this world to see HIM before he died;never talked about nothing else all these three weeks;hadn't seen him since they was boys together -- andhadn't ever seen his brother William at all -- that's thedeef and dumb one -- William ain't more than thirtyor thirty-five. Peter and George were the only onesthat come out here; George was the married brother;him and his wife both died last year. Harvey andWilliam's the only ones that's left now; and, as I wassaying, they haven't got here in time."
"Did anybody send 'em word?"
"Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter wasfirst took; because Peter said then that he sorter feltlike he warn't going to get well this time. You see,he was pretty old, and George's g'yirls was too youngto be much company for him, except Mary Jane, thered-headed one; and so he was kinder lonesome afterGeorge and his wife died, and didn't seem to caremuch to live. He most desperately wanted to seeHarvey -- and William, too, for that matter -- becausehe was one of them kind that can't bear to make awill. He left a letter behind for Harvey, and saidhe'd told in it where his money was hid, and how hewanted the rest of the property divided up so George'sg'yirls would be all right -- for George didn't leavenothing. And that letter was all they could get himto put a pen to."
"Why do you reckon Harvey don't come? Wher'does he live?"
"Oh, he lives in England -- Sheffield -- preachesthere -- hasn't ever been in this country. He hasn'thad any too much time -- and besides he mightn't agot the letter at all, you know."
"Too bad, too bad he couldn't a lived to see hisbrothers, poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?"
"Yes, but that ain't only a part of it. I'm goingin a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, wheremy uncle lives."
"It's a pretty long journey. But it'll be lovely;wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? Howold is the others?"
"Mary Jane's nineteen, Susan's fifteen, and Joanna'sabout fourteen -- that's the one that gives herself togood works and has a hare-lip."
"Poor things! to be left alone in the cold worldso."
"Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter hadfriends, and they ain't going to let them come to noharm. There's Hobson, the Babtis' preacher; andDeacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker, and AbnerShackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Rob-inson, and their wives, and the widow Bartley, and --well, there's a lot of them; but these are the ones thatPeter was thickest with, and used to write about some-times, when he wrote home; so Harvey 'll know whereto look for friends when he gets here."
Well, the old man went on asking questions till hejust fairly emptied that young fellow. Blamed if hedidn't inquire about everybody and everything in thatblessed town, and all about the Wilkses; and aboutPeter's business -- which was a tanner; and aboutGeorge's -- which was a carpenter; and about Har-vey's -- which was a dissentering minister; and so on,and so on. Then he says:
"What did you want to walk all the way up to thesteamboat for?"
"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeardshe mightn't stop there. When they're deep theywon't stop for a hail. A Cincinnati boat will, but thisis a St. Louis one."
"Was Peter Wilks well off?"
"Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses andland, and it's reckoned he left three or four thousandin cash hid up som'ers."
"When did you say he died?"
"I didn't say, but it was last night."
"Funeral to-morrow, likely?"
"Yes, 'bout the middle of the day."
"Well, it's all terrible sad; but we've all got to go,one time or another. So what we want to do is to beprepared; then we're all right."
"Yes, sir, it's the best way. Ma used to alwayssay that."
When we struck the boat she was about done load-ing, and pretty soon she got off. The king never saidnothing about going aboard, so I lost my ride, afterall. When the boat was gone the king made me pad-dle up another mile to a lonesome place, and then hegot ashore and says:
"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke uphere, and the new carpet-bags. And if he's gone overto t'other side, go over there and git him. And tellhim to git himself up regardless. Shove along, now."
I see what HE was up to; but I never said nothing,of course. When I got back with the duke we hid thecanoe, and then they set down on a log, and the kingtold him everything, just like the young fellow hadsaid it -- every last word of it. And all the time hewas a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman;and he done it pretty well, too, for a slouch. I can'timitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but hereally done it pretty good. Then he says:
"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?"
The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he hadplayed a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards.So then they waited for a steamboat.
About the middle of the afternoon a couple of littleboats come along, but they didn't come from highenough up the river; but at last there was a big one,and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and wewent aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and whenthey found we only wanted to go four or five milethey was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, andsaid they wouldn't land us. But the king was ca'm.He says:
"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mileapiece to be took on and put off in a yawl, a steam-boat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?"
So they softened down and said it was all right;and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore.About two dozen men flocked down when they see theyawl a-coming, and when the king says:
"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. PeterWilks lives?" they give a glance at one another, andnodded their heads, as much as to say, "What d' Itell you?" Then one of them says, kind of soft andgentle:
"I'm sorry. sir, but the best we can do is to tellyou where he DID live yesterday evening."
Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went anto smash, and fell up against the man, and put hischin on his shoulder, and cried down his back, andsays:
"Alas, alas, our poor brother -- gone, and we nevergot to see him; oh, it's too, too hard!"
Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lotof idiotic signs to the duke on his hands, and blamedif he didn't drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying.If they warn't the beatenest lot, them two frauds, thatever I struck.
Well, the men gathered around and sympathizedwith them, and said all sorts of kind things to them,and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them, andlet them lean on them and cry, and told the king allabout his brother's last moments, and the king he toldit all over again on his hands to the duke, and both ofthem took on about that dead tanner like they'd lostthe twelve disciples. Well, if ever I struck anythinglike it, I'm a nigger. It was enough to make a bodyashamed of the human race.
