How curious and interesting is the parallel--as far as poverty ofbiographical details is concerned--between Satan and Shakespeare.It is wonderful, it is unique, it stands quite alone, there isnothing resembling it in history, nothing resembling it in romance,nothing approaching it even in tradition. How sublime is theirposition, and how over-topping, how sky-reaching, how supreme--thetwo Great Unknowns, the two Illustrious Conjecturabilities! Theyare the best-known unknown persons that have ever drawn breath uponthe planet.
For the instruction of the ignorant I will make a list, now, ofthose details of Shakespeare's history which are FACTS--verifiedfacts, established facts, undisputed facts.
FACTS
He was born on the 23d of April, 1564.
Of good farmer-class parents who could not read, could not write,could not sign their names.
At Stratford, a small back settlement which in that day was shabbyand unclean, and densely illiterate. Of the nineteen important mencharged with the government of the town, thirteen had to "maketheir mark" in attesting important documents, because they couldnot write their names.
Of the first eighteen years of his life NOTHING is known. They area blank.
On the 27th of November (1582) William Shakespeare took out alicense to marry Anne Whateley.
Next day William Shakespeare took out a license to marry AnneHathaway. She was eight years his senior.
William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway. In a hurry. By graceof a reluctantly-granted dispensation there was but one publicationof the banns.
Within six months the first child was born.
About two (blank) years followed, during which period NOTHING ATALL HAPPENED TO SHAKESPEARE, so far as anybody knows.
Then came twins--1585. February.
Two blank years follow.
Then--1587--he makes a ten-year visit to London, leaving the familybehind.
Five blank years follow. During this period NOTHING HAPPENED TOHIM, as far as anybody actually knows.
Then--1592--there is mention of him as an actor.
Next year--1593--his name appears in the official list of players.
Next year--1594--he played before the queen. A detail of noconsequence: other obscurities did it every year of the forty-fiveof her reign. And remained obscure.
Three pretty full years follow. Full of play-acting. Then
In 1597 he bought New Place, Stratford.
Thirteen or fourteen busy years follow; years in which heaccumulated money, and also reputation as actor and manager.
Meantime his name, liberally and variously spelt, had becomeassociated with a number of great plays and poems, as (ostensibly)author of the same.
Some of these, in these years and later, were pirated, but he madeno protest. Then--1610-11--he returned to Stratford and settleddown for good and all, and busied himself in lending money, tradingin tithes, trading in land and houses; shirking a debt of forty-oneshillings, borrowed by his wife during his long desertion of hisfamily; suing debtors for shillings and coppers; being sued himselffor shillings and coppers; and acting as confederate to a neighborwho tried to rob the town of its rights in a certain common, anddid not succeed.
He lived five or six years--till 1616--in the joy of these elevatedpursuits. Then he made a will, and signed each of its three pageswith his name.
A thoroughgoing business man's will. It named in minute detailevery item of property he owned in the world--houses, lands, sword,silver-gilt bowl, and so on--all the way down to his "second-bestbed" and its furniture.
It carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among themembers of his family, overlooking no individual of it. Not evenhis wife: the wife he had been enabled to marry in a hurry byurgent grace of a special dispensation before he was nineteen; thewife whom he had left husbandless so many years; the wife who hadhad to borrow forty-one shillings in her need, and which the lenderwas never able to collect of the prosperous husband, but died atlast with the money still lacking. No, even this wife wasremembered in Shakespeare's will.
He left her that "second-best bed."
And NOT ANOTHER THING; not even a penny to bless her luckywidowhood with.
It was eminently and conspicuously a business man's will, not apoet's.
It mentioned NOT A SINGLE BOOK.
Books were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt bowls andsecond-best beds in those days, and when a departing person ownedone he gave it a high place in his will.
The will mentioned NOT A PLAY, NOT A POEM, NOT AN UNFINISHEDLITERARY WORK, NOT A SCRAP OF MANUSCRIPT OF ANY KIND.
Many poets have died poor, but this is the only one in history thathas died THIS poor; the others all left literary remains behind.Also a book. Maybe two.
If Shakespeare had owned a dog--but we need not go into that: weknow he would have mentioned it in his will. If a good dog,Susanna would have got it; if an inferior one his wife would havegot a dower interest in it. I wish he had had a dog, just so wecould see how painstakingly he would have divided that dog amongthe family, in his careful business way.
He signed the will in three places.
In earlier years he signed two other official documents.
These five signatures still exist.
There are NO OTHER SPECIMENS OF HIS PENMANSHIP IN EXISTENCE. Not aline.
Was he prejudiced against the art? His granddaughter, whom heloved, was eight years old when he died, yet she had had noteaching, he left no provision for her education although he wasrich, and in her mature womanhood she couldn't write and couldn'ttell her husband's manuscript from anybody else's--she thought itwas Shakespeare's.
When Shakespeare died in Stratford IT WAS NOT AN EVENT. It made nomore stir in England than the death of any other forgotten theatre-actor would have made. Nobody came down from London; there were nolamenting poems, no eulogies, no national tears--there was merelysilence, and nothing more. A striking contrast with what happenedwhen Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon, and Spenser, and Raleigh andthe other distinguished literary folk of Shakespeare's time passedfrom life! No praiseful voice was lifted for the lost Bard ofAvon; even Ben Jonson waited seven years before he lifted his.
SO FAR AS ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare ofStratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his life.
SO FAR AS ANYBODY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, he never wrote a letter toanybody in his life.
SO FAR AS ANY ONE KNOWS, HE RECEIVED ONLY ONE LETTER DURING HISLIFE.
So far as any one KNOWS AND CAN PROVE, Shakespeare of Stratfordwrote only one poem during his life. This one is authentic. Hedid write that one--a fact which stands undisputed; he wrote thewhole of it; he wrote the whole of it out of his own head. Hecommanded that this work of art be engraved upon his tomb, and hewas obeyed. There it abides to this day. This is it:
Good friend for Iesus sake forbeareTo digg the dust encloased heare:Blest be ye man yt spares thes stonesAnd curst be he yt moves my bones.
In the list as above set down, will be found EVERY POSITIVELY KNOWNfact of Shakespeare's life, lean and meagre as the invoice is.Beyond these details we know NOT A THING about him. All the restof his vast history, as furnished by the biographers, is built up,course upon course, of guesses, inferences, theories, conjectures--an Eiffel Tower of artificialities rising sky-high from a very flatand very thin foundation of inconsequential facts.
