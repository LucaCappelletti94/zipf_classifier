 24 Joan the Martyr
AT NINE o'clock the Maid of Orleans, Deliverer of France, went forth inthe grace of her innocence and her youth to lay down her life for thecountry she loved with such devotion, and for the King that had abandonedher. She sat in the cart that is used only for felons. In one respect shewas treated worse than a felon; for whereas she was on her way to besentenced by the civil arm, she already bore her judgment inscribed inadvance upon a miter-shaped cap which she wore:
HERETIC, RELAPSED, APOSTATE, IDOLATER
In the cart with her sat the friar Martin Ladvenu and Maetre JeanMassieu. She looked girlishly fair and sweet and saintly in her longwhite robe, and when a gush of sunlight flooded her as she emerged fromthe gloom of the prison and was yet for a moment still framed in the archof the somber gate, the massed multitudes of poor folk murmured "Avision! a vision!" and sank to their knees praying, and many of the womenweeping; and the moving invocation for the dying arose again, and wastaken up and borne along, a majestic wave of sound, which accompanied thedoomed, solacing and blessing her, all the sorrowful way to the place ofdeath. "Christ have pity! Saint Margaret have pity! Pray for her, all yesaints, archangels, and blessed martyrs, pray for her! Saints and angelsintercede for her! From thy wrath, good Lord, deliver her! O Lord God,save her! Have mercy on her, we beseech Thee, good Lord!"
It is just and true what one of the histories has said: "The poor and thehelpless had nothing but their prayers to give Joan of Arc; but these wemay believe were not unavailing. There are few more pathetic eventsrecorded in history than this weeping, helpless, praying crowd, holdingtheir lighted candles and kneeling on the pavement beneath the prisonwalls of the old fortress."
And it was so all the way: thousands upon thousands massed upon theirknees and stretching far down the distances, thick-sown with the faintyellow candle-flames, like a field starred with golden flowers.
But there were some that did not kneel; these were the English soldiers.They stood elbow to elbow, on each side of Joan's road, and walled it inall the way; and behind these living walls knelt the multitudes.
By and by a frantic man in priest's garb came wailing and lamenting, andtore through the crowd and the barriers of soldiers and flung himself onhis knees by Joan's cart and put up his hands in supplication, cryingout:
"O forgive, forgive!"
It was Loyseleur!
And Joan forgave him; forgave him out of a heart that knew nothing butforgiveness, nothing but compassion, nothing but pity for all thatsuffer, let their offense be what it might. And she had no word ofreproach for this poor wretch who had wrought day and night with deceitsand treacheries and hypocrisies to betray her to her death.
The soldiers would have killed him, but the Earl of Warwick saved hislife. What became of him is not known. He hid himself from the worldsomewhere, to endure his remorse as he might.
In the square of the Old Market stood the two platforms and the stakethat had stood before in the churchyard of St. Ouen. The platforms wereoccupied as before, the one by Joan and her judges, the other by greatdignitaries, the principal being Cauchon and the EnglishCardinal--Winchester. The square was packed with people, the windows androofs of the blocks of buildings surrounding it were black with them.
When the preparations had been finished, all noise and movement graduallyceased, and a waiting stillness followed which was solemn and impressive.
And now, by order of Cauchon, an ecclesiastic named Nicholas Midipreached a sermon, wherein he explained that when a branch of thevine--which is the Church--becomes diseased and corrupt, it must be cutaway or it will corrupt and destroy the whole vine. He made it appearthat Joan, through her wickedness, was a menace and a peril to theChurch's purity and holiness, and her death therefore necessary. When hewas come to the end of his discourse he turned toward her and paused amoment, then he said:
"Joan, the Church can no longer protect you. Go in peace!"
Joan had been placed wholly apart and conspicuous, to signify theChurch's abandonment of her, and she sat there in her loneliness, waitingin patience and resignation for the end. Cauchon addressed her now. Hehad been advised to read the form of her abjuration to her, and hadbrought it with him; but he changed his mind, fearing that she wouldproclaim the truth--that she had never knowingly abjured--and so bringshame upon him and eternal infamy. He contented himself with admonishingher to keep in mind her wickednesses, and repent of them, and think ofher salvation. Then he solemnly pronounced her excommunicate and cut offfrom the body of the Church. With a final word he delivered her over tothe secular arm for judgment and sentence.
Joan, weeping, knelt and began to pray. For whom? Herself? Oh, no--forthe King of France. Her voice rose sweet and clear, and penetrated allhearts with its passionate pathos. She never thought of his treacheriesto her, she never thought of his desertion of her, she never rememberedthat it was because he was an ingrate that she was here to die amiserable death; she remembered only that he was her King, that she washis loyal and loving subject, and that his enemies had undermined hiscause with evil reports and false charges, and he not by to defendhimself. And so, in the very presence of death, she forgot her owntroubles to implore all in her hearing to be just to him; to believe thathe was good and noble and sincere, and not in any way to blame for anyacts of hers, neither advising them nor urging them, but being whollyclear and free of all responsibility for them. Then, closing, she beggedin humble and touching words that all here present would pray for her andwould pardon her, both her enemies and such as might look friendly uponher and feel pity for her in their hearts.
There was hardly one heart there that was not touched--even the English,even the judges showed it, and there was many a lip that trembled andmany an eye that was blurred with tears; yes, even the EnglishCardinal's--that man with a political heart of stone but a human heart offlesh.
The secular judge who should have delivered judgment and pronouncedsentence was himself so disturbed that he forgot his duty, and Joan wentto her death unsentenced--thus completing with an illegality what hadbegun illegally and had so continued to the end. He only said--to theguards:
"Take her"; and to the executioner, "Do your duty."
Joan asked for a cross. None was able to furnish one. But an Englishsoldier broke a stick in two and crossed the pieces and tied themtogether, and this cross he gave her, moved to it by the good heart thatwas in him; and she kissed it and put it in her bosom. Then Isambard dela Pierre went to the church near by and brought her a consecrated one;and this one also she kissed, and pressed it to her bosom with rapture,and then kissed it again and again, covering it with tears and pouringout her gratitude to God and the saints.
And so, weeping, and with her cross to her lips, she climbed up the cruelsteps to the face of the stake, with the friar Isambard at her side. Thenshe was helped up to the top of the pile of wood that was built aroundthe lower third of the stake and stood upon it with her back against thestake, and the world gazing up at her breathless. The executionerascended to her side and wound chains around her slender body, and sofastened her to the stake. Then he descended to finish his dreadfuloffice; and there she remained alone--she that had had so many friends inthe days when she was free, and had been so loved and so dear.
All these things I saw, albeit dimly and blurred with tears; but I couldbear no more. I continued in my place, but what I shall deliver to younow I got by others' eyes and others' mouths. Tragic sounds there werethat pierced my ears and wounded my heart as I sat there, but it is as Itell you: the latest image recorded by my eyes in that desolating hourwas Joan of Arc with the grace of her comely youth still unmarred; andthat image, untouched by time or decay, has remained with me all my days.Now I will go on.
If any thought that now, in that solemn hour when all transgressorsrepent and confess, she would revoke her revocation and say her greatdeeds had been evil deeds and Satan and his fiends their source, theyerred. No such thought was in her blameless mind. She was not thinking ofherself and her troubles, but of others, and of woes that might befallthem. And so, turning her grieving eyes about her, where rose the towersand spires of that fair city, she said:
"Oh, Rouen, Rouen, must I die here, and must you be my tomb? Ah, Rouen,Rouen, I have great fear that you will suffer for my death."
A whiff of smoke swept upward past her face, and for one moment terrorseized her and she cried out, "Water! Give me holy water!" but the nextmoment her fears were gone, and they came no more to torture her.
She heard the flames crackling below her, and immediately distress for afellow-creature who was in danger took possession of her. It was thefriar Isambard. She had given him her cross and begged him to raise ittoward her face and let her eyes rest in hope and consolation upon ittill she was entered into the peace of God. She made him go out from thedanger of the fire. Then she was satisfied, and said:
"Now keep it always in my sight until the end."
Not even yet could Cauchon, that man without shame, endure to let her diein peace, but went toward her, all black with crimes and sins as he was,and cried out:
"I am come, Joan, to exhort you for the last time to repent and seek thepardon of God."
"I die through you," she said, and these were the last words she spoke toany upon earth.
Then the pitchy smoke, shot through with red flashes of flame, rolled upin a thick volume and hid her from sight; and from the heart of thisdarkness her voice rose strong and eloquent in prayer, and when bymoments the wind shredded somewhat of the smoke aside, there were veiledglimpses of an upturned face and moving lips. At last a mercifully swifttide of flame burst upward, and none saw that face any more nor thatform, and the voice was still.
Yes, she was gone from us: JOAN OF ARC! What little words they are, totell of a rich world made empty and poor!
CONCLUSION
JOAN'S BROTHER Jacques died in Domremy during the Great Trial at Rouen.This was according to the prophecy which Joan made that day in thepastures the time that she said the rest of us would go to the greatwars.
When her poor old father heard of the martyrdom it broke his heart, andhe died.
The mother was granted a pension by the city of Orleans, and upon thisshe lived out her days, which were many. Twenty-four years after herillustrious child's death she traveled all the way to Paris in thewinter-time and was present at the opening of the discussion in theCathedral of Notre Dame which was the first step in the Rehabilitation.Paris was crowded with people, from all about France, who came to getsight of the venerable dame, and it was a touching spectacle when shemoved through these reverent wet-eyed multitudes on her way to the grandhonors awaiting her at the cathedral. With her were Jean and Pierre, nolonger the light-hearted youths who marched with us from Vaucouleurs, butwar-torn veterans with hair beginning to show frost.
After the martyrdom Noel and I went back to Domremy, but presently whenthe Constable Richemont superseded La Tremouille as the King's chiefadviser and began the completion of Joan's great work, we put on ourharness and returned to the field and fought for the King all through thewars and skirmishes until France was freed of the English. It was whatJoan would have desired of us; and, dead or alive, her desire was law forus. All the survivors of the personal staff were faithful to her memoryand fought for the King to the end. Mainly we were well scattered, butwhen Paris fell we happened to be together. It was a great day and ajoyous; but it was a sad one at the same time, because Joan was not thereto march into the captured capital with us.
Noel and I remained always together, and I was by his side when deathclaimed him. It was in the last great battle of the war. In that battlefell also Joan's sturdy old enemy Talbot. He was eighty-five years old,and had spent his whole life in battle. A fine old lion he was, with hisflowing white mane and his tameless spirit; yes, and his indestructibleenergy as well; for he fought as knightly and vigorous a fight that dayas the best man there.
La Hire survived the martyrdom thirteen years; and always fighting, ofcourse, for that was all he enjoyed in life. I did not see him in allthat time, for we were far apart, but one was always hearing of him.
The Bastard of Orleans and D'Alencon and D'Aulon lived to see Francefree, and to testify with Jean and Pierre d'Arc and Pasquerel and me atthe Rehabilitation. But they are all at rest now, these many years. Ialone am left of those who fought at the side of Joan of Arc in the greatwars.
She said I would live until those wars were forgotten--a prophecy whichfailed. If I should live a thousand years it would still fail. Forwhatsoever had touch with Joan of Arc, that thing is immortal.
Members of Joan's family married, and they have left descendants. Theirdescendants are of the nobility, but their family name and blood bringthem honors which no other nobles receive or may hope for. You have seenhow everybody along the way uncovered when those children came yesterdayto pay their duty to me. It was not because they are noble, it is becausethey are grandchildren of the brothers of Joan of Arc.
Now as to the Rehabilitation. Joan crowned the King at Rheims. For rewardhe allowed her to be hunted to her death without making one effort tosave her. During the next twenty-three years he remained indifferent toher memory; indifferent to the fact that her good name was under adamning blot put there by the priest because of the deeds which she haddone in saving him and his scepter; indifferent to the fact that Francewas ashamed, and longed to have the Deliverer's fair fame restored.Indifferent all that time. Then he suddenly changed and was anxious tohave justice for poor Joan himself. Why? Had he become grateful at last?Had remorse attacked his hard heart? No, he had a better reason--a betterone for his sort of man. This better reason was that, now that theEnglish had been finally expelled from the country, they were beginningto call attention to the fact that this King had gotten his crown by thehands of a person proven by the priests to have been in league with Satanand burned for it by them as a sorceress--therefore, of what value orauthority was such a Kingship as that? Of no value at all; no nationcould afford to allow such a king to remain on the throne.
It was high time to stir now, and the King did it. That is how CharlesVII. came to be smitten with anxiety to have justice done the memory ofhis benefactress.
He appealed to the Pope, and the Pope appointed a great commission ofchurchmen to examine into the facts of Joan's life and award judgment.The Commission sat at Paris, at Domremy, at Rouen, at Orleans, and atseveral other places, and continued its work during several months. Itexamined the records of Joan's trials, it examined the Bastard ofOrleans, and the Duke d'Alencon, and D'Aulon, and Pasquerel, andCourcelles, and Isambard de la Pierre, and Manchon, and me, and manyothers whose names I have made familiar to you; also they examined morethan a hundred witnesses whose names are less familiar to you--thefriends of Joan in Domremy, Vaucouleurs, Orleans, and other places, and anumber of judges and other people who had assisted at the Rouen trials,the abjuration, and the martyrdom. And out of this exhaustive examinationJoan's character and history came spotless and perfect, and this verdictwas placed upon record, to remain forever.
I was present upon most of these occasions, and saw again many faceswhich I have not seen for a quarter of a century; among them somewell-beloved faces--those of our generals and that of Catherine Boucher(married, alas!), and also among them certain other faces that filled mewith bitterness--those of Beaupere and Courcelles and a number of theirfellow-fiends. I saw Haumette and Little Mengette--edging along towardfifty now, and mothers of many children. I saw Noel's father, and theparents of the Paladin and the Sunflower.
It was beautiful to hear the Duke d'Alencon praise Joan's splendidcapacities as a general, and to hear the Bastard indorse these praiseswith his eloquent tongue and then go on and tell how sweet and good Joanwas, and how full of pluck and fire and impetuosity, and mischief, andmirthfulness, and tenderness, and compassion, and everything that waspure and fine and noble and lovely. He made her live again before me, andwrung my heart.
I have finished my story of Joan of Arc, that wonderful child, thatsublime personality, that spirit which in one regard has had no peer andwill have none--this: its purity from all alloy of self-seeking,self-interest, personal ambition. In it no trace of these motives can befound, search as you may, and this cannot be said of any other personwhose name appears in profane history.
With Joan of Arc love of country was more than a sentiment--it was apassion. She was the Genius of Patriotism--she was Patriotism embodied,concreted, made flesh, and palpable to the touch and visible to the eye.
Love, Mercy, Charity, Fortitude, War, Peace, Poetry, Music--these may besymbolized as any shall prefer: by figures of either sex and of any age;but a slender girl in her first young bloom, with the martyr's crown uponher head, and in her hand the sword that severed her country'sbonds--shall not this, and no other, stand for PATRIOTISM through all the
