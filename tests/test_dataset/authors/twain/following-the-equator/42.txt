Each person is born to one possession which outvalues all his others--hislast breath. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

Toward midnight, that night, there was another function.  This was aHindoo wedding--no, I think it was a betrothal ceremony.  Always before,we had driven through streets that were multitudinous and tumultuous withpicturesque native life, but now there was nothing of that.  We seemed tomove through a city of the dead.  There was hardly a suggestion of lifein those still and vacant streets.  Even the crows were silent.  Buteverywhere on the ground lay sleeping natives-hundreds and hundreds.They lay stretched at full length and tightly wrapped in blankets, beadsand all.  Their attitude and their rigidity counterfeited death.  Theplague was not in Bombay then, but it is devastating the city now.  Theshops are deserted, now, half of the people have fled, and of theremainder the smitten perish by shoals every day.  No doubt the citylooks now in the daytime as it looked then at night.  When we had pierceddeep into the native quarter and were threading its narrow dim lanes, wehad to go carefully, for men were stretched asleep all about and therewas hardly room to drive between them.  And every now and then a swarm ofrats would scamper across past the horses' feet in the vague light--theforbears of the rats that are carrying the plague from house to house inBombay now. The shops were but sheds, little booths open to the street;and the goods had been removed, and on the counters families weresleeping, usually with an oil lamp present.  Recurrent dead  watches, itlooked like.
But at last we turned a corner and saw a great glare of light ahead.  Itwas the home of the bride, wrapped in a perfect conflagration ofilluminations,--mainly gas-work designs, gotten up specially for theoccasion.  Within was abundance of brilliancy--flames, costumes, colors,decorations, mirrors--it was another Aladdin show.
The bride was a trim and comely little thing of twelve years, dressed aswe would dress a boy, though more expensively than we should do it, ofcourse.  She moved about very much at her ease, and stopped and talkedwith the guests and allowed her wedding jewelry to be examined.  It wasvery fine.  Particularly a rope of great diamonds, a lovely thing to lookat and handle.  It had a great emerald hanging to it.
The bridegroom was not present.  He was having betrothal festivities ofhis own at his father's house.  As I understood it, he and the bride wereto entertain company every night and nearly all night for a week or more,then get married, if alive.  Both of the children were a little elderly,as brides and grooms go, in India--twelve; they ought to have beenmarried a year or two sooner; still to a stranger twelve seems quiteyoung enough.
A while after midnight a couple of celebrated and high-pricednautch-girls appeared in the gorgeous place, and danced and sang.  Withthem were men who played upon strange instruments which made uncannynoises of a sort to make one's flesh creep.  One of these instruments wasa pipe, and to its music the girls went through a performance whichrepresented snake charming.  It seemed a doubtful sort of music to charmanything with, but a native gentleman assured me that snakes like it andwill come out of their holes and listen to it with every evidence ofrefreshment And gratitude.  He said that at an entertainment in hisgrounds once, the pipe brought out half a dozen snakes, and the music hadto be stopped before they would be persuaded to go.  Nobody wanted theircompany, for they were bold, familiar, and dangerous; but no one wouldkill them, of course, for it is sinful for a Hindoo to kill any kind of acreature.
We withdrew from the festivities at two in the morning.  Another picture,then--but it has lodged itself in my memory rather as a stage-scene thanas a reality.  It is of a porch and short flight of steps crowded withdark faces and ghostly-white draperies flooded with the strong glare fromthe dazzling concentration of illuminations; and midway of the steps oneconspicuous figure for accent--a turbaned giant, with a name according tohis size: Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale, Vakeel to his Highnessthe Gaikwar of Baroda.  Without him the picture would not have beencomplete; and if his name had been merely Smith, he wouldn't haveanswered.  Close at hand on house-fronts on both sides of the narrowstreet were illuminations of a kind commonly employed by the natives--scores of glass tumblers (containing tapers) fastened a few in inchesapart all over great latticed frames, forming starry constellations whichshowed out vividly against their black back grounds.  As we  drew awayinto the distance down the dim lanes the illuminations gathered togetherinto a single mass, and glowed out of the enveloping darkness like a sun.
Then again the deep silence, the skurrying rats, the dim forms stretchedevery-where on the ground; and on either hand those open boothscounterfeiting sepulchres, with counterfeit corpses sleeping motionlessin the flicker of the counterfeit death lamps.  And now, a year later,when I read the cablegrams I seem to be reading of what I myself partlysaw--saw before it happened--in a prophetic dream, as it were.  Onecablegram says, "Business in the native town is about suspended.  Exceptthe wailing and the tramp of the funerals.  There is but little life ormovement.  The closed shops exceed in number those that remain open."Another says that 325,000 of the people have fled the city and arecarrying the plague to the country.  Three days later comes the news,"The population is reduced by half."  The refugees have carried thedisease to Karachi; "220 cases, 214 deaths."  A day or two later, "52fresh cases, all of which proved fatal."
The plague carries with it a terror which no other disease can excite;for of all diseases known to men it is the deadliest--by far thedeadliest.  "Fifty-two fresh cases--all fatal."  It is the Black Deathalone that slays like that.  We can all imagine, after a fashion, thedesolation of a plague-stricken city, and the stupor of stillness brokenat intervals by distant bursts of wailing, marking the passing offunerals, here and there and yonder, but I suppose it is not possible forus to realize to ourselves the nightmare of dread and fear that possessesthe living who are present in such a place and cannot get away.  Thathalf million fled from Bombay in a wild panic suggests to us something ofwhat they were feeling, but perhaps not even they could realize what thehalf million were feeling whom they left stranded behind to face thestalking horror without chance of escape.  Kinglake was in Cairo manyyears ago during an epidemic of the Black Death, and he has imagined theterrors that creep into a man's heart at such a time and follow him untilthey themselves breed the fatal sign in the armpit, and then the deliriumwith confused images, and home-dreams, and reeling billiard-tables, andthen the sudden blank of death:
     "To the contagionist, filled as he is with the dread of final     causes, having no faith in destiny, nor in the fixed will of God,     and with none of the devil-may-care indifference which might stand     him instead of creeds--to such one, every rag that shivers in the     breeze of a plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity.  If by     any terrible ordinance he be forced to venture forth, he sees death     dangling from every sleeve; and, as he creeps forward, he poises his     shuddering limbs between the imminent jacket that is stabbing at his     right elbow and the murderous pelisse that threatens to mow him     clean down as it sweeps along on his left.  But most of all he     dreads that which most of all he should love--the touch of a woman's     dress; for mothers and wives, hurrying forth on kindly errands from     the bedsides of the dying, go slouching along through the streets     more willfully and less courteously than the men.  For a while it     may be that the caution of the poor Levantine may enable him to     avoid contact, but sooner or later, perhaps, the dreaded chance     arrives; that bundle of linen, with the dark tearful eyes at the top     of it, that labors along with the voluptuous clumsiness of Grisi     --she has touched the poor Levantine with the hem of her sleeve!  From     that dread moment his peace is gone; his mind for ever hanging upon     the fatal touch invites the blow which he fears; he watches for the     symptoms of plague so carefully, that sooner or later they come in     truth.  The parched mouth is a sign--his mouth is parched; the     throbbing brain--his brain does throb; the rapid pulse--he touches     his own wrist (for he dares not ask counsel of any man lest he be     deserted), he touches his wrist, and feels how his frighted blood     goes galloping out of his heart.  There is nothing but the fatal     swelling that is wanting to make his sad conviction complete;     immediately, he has an odd feel under the arm--no pain, but a little     straining of the skin; he would to God it were his fancy that were     strong enough to give him that sensation; this is the worst of all.     It now seems to him that he could be happy and contented with his     parched mouth, and his throbbing brain, and his rapid pulse, if only     he could know that there were no swelling under the left arm; but     dares he try?--in a moment of calmness and deliberation he dares     not; but when for a while he has writhed under the torture of     suspense, a sudden strength of will drives him to seek and know his     fate; he touches the gland, and finds the skin sane and sound but     under the cuticle there lies a small lump like a pistol-bullet, that     moves as he pushes it.  Oh! but is this for all certainty, is this     the sentence of death?  Feel the gland of the other arm.  There is     not the same lump exactly, yet something a little like it.  Have not     some people glands naturally enlarged?--would to heaven he were one!     So he does for himself the work of the plague, and when the Angel of     Death thus courted does indeed and in truth come, he has only to     finish that which has been so well begun; he passes his fiery hand     over the brain of the victim, and lets him rave for a season, but     all chance-wise, of people and things once dear, or of people and     things indifferent.  Once more the poor fellow is back at his home     in fair Provence, and sees the sundial that stood in his childhood's     garden--sees his mother, and the long-since forgotten face of that     little dear sister--(he sees her, he says, on a Sunday morning, for     all the church bells are ringing); he looks up and down through the     universe, and owns it well piled with bales upon bales of cotton,     and cotton eternal--so much so that he feels--he knows--he swears he     could make that winning hazard, if the billiard-table would not     slant upwards, and if the cue were a cue worth playing with; but it     is not--it's a cue that won't move--his own arm won't move--in     short, there's the devil to pay in the brain of the poor Levantine;     and perhaps, the next night but one he becomes the 'life and the     soul' of some squalling jackal family, who fish him out by the foot     from his shallow and sandy grave."
