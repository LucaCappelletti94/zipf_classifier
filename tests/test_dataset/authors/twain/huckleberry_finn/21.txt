Well, next they got out a couple of long swords thatthe duke made out of oak laths, and begun to practicethe sword fight -- the duke called himself RichardIII.; and the way they laid on and pranced aroundthe raft was grand to see. But by and by the kingtripped and fell overboard, and after that they took arest, and had a talk about all kinds of adventuresthey'd had in other times along the river.
After dinner the duke says:
"Well, Capet, we'll want to make this a first-classshow, you know, so I guess we'll add a little more toit. We want a little something to answer encoreswith, anyway."
"What's onkores, Bilgewater?"
The duke told him, and then says:
"I'll answer by doing the Highland fling or thesailor's hornpipe; and you -- well, let me see -- oh,I've got it -- you can do Hamlet's soliloquy."
"Hamlet's which?"
"Hamlet's soliloquy, you know; the most celebratedthing in Shakespeare. Ah, it's sublime, sublime! Al-ways fetches the house. I haven't got it in the book-- I've only got one volume -- but I reckon I canpiece it out from memory. I'll just walk up and downa minute, and see if I can call it back from recollec-tion's vaults."
So he went to marching up and down, thinking, andfrowning horrible every now and then; then he wouldhoist up his eyebrows; next he would squeeze his handon his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan;next he would sigh, and next he'd let on to drop atear. It was beautiful to see him. By and by he gotit. He told us to give attention. Then he strikes amost noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, andhis arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back,looking up at the sky; and then he begins to rip andrave and grit his teeth; and after that, all through hisspeech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled uphis chest, and just knocked the spots out of any actingever I see before. This is the speech -- I learned it,easy enough, while he was learning it to the king:
   To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin   That makes calamity of so long life;   For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do     come to Dunsinane,   But that the fear of something after death   Murders the innocent sleep,   Great nature's second course,   And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune   Than fly to others that we know not of.   There's the respect must give us pause:   Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst;   For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,   The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,   The law's delay, and the quietus which his     pangs might take,   In the dead waste and middle of the night,     when churchyards yawn   In customary suits of solemn black,   But that the undiscovered country from whose     bourne no traveler returns,   Breathes forth contagion on the world,   And thus the native hue of resolution, like     the poor cat i' the adage,   Is sicklied o'er with care,   And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops,   With this regard their currents turn awry,   And lose the name of action.   'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished.     But soft you, the fair Ophelia:   Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws,   But get thee to a nunnery -- go!
Well, the old man he liked that speech, and hemighty soon got it so he could do it first-rate. Itseemed like he was just born for it; and when he hadhis hand in and was excited, it was perfectly lovelythe way he would rip and tear and rair up behindwhen he was getting it off.
The first chance we got the duke he had some show-bills printed; and after that, for two or three days aswe floated along, the raft was a most uncommon livelyplace, for there warn't nothing but sword fighting andrehearsing -- as the duke called it -- going on all thetime. One morning, when we was pretty well downthe State of Arkansaw, we come in sight of a littleone-horse town in a big bend; so we tied up aboutthree-quarters of a mile above it, in the mouth of acrick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypresstrees, and all of us but Jim took the canoe and wentdown there to see if there was any chance in that placefor our show.
We struck it mighty lucky; there was going to be acircus there that afternoon, and the country people wasalready beginning to come in, in all kinds of oldshackly wagons, and on horses. The circus wouldleave before night, so our show would have a prettygood chance. The duke he hired the courthouse, andwe went around and stuck up our bills. They readlike this:

Then we went loafing around town. The stores andhouses was most all old, shackly, dried up frame con-cerns that hadn't ever been painted; they was set upthree or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to beout of reach of the water when the river was over-flowed. The houses had little gardens around them,but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in thembut jimpson-weeds, and sunflowers, and ash piles, andold curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles,and rags, and played-out tinware. The fences wasmade of different kinds of boards, nailed on at dif-ferent times; and they leaned every which way, andhad gates that didn't generly have but one hinge -- aleather one. Some of the fences had been white-washed some time or another, but the duke said it wasin Clumbus' time, like enough. There was generlyhogs in the garden, and people driving them out.
All the stores was along one street. They hadwhite domestic awnings in front, and the country peo-ple hitched their horses to the awning-posts. Therewas empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, andloafers roosting on them all day long, whittling themwith their Barlow knives; and chawing tobacco, andgaping and yawning and stretching -- a mighty ornerylot. They generly had on yellow straw hats most aswide as an umbrella, but didn't wear no coats norwaistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck,and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy anddrawly, and used considerable many cuss words.There was as many as one loafer leaning up againstevery awning-post, and he most always had his handsin his britches-pockets, except when he fetched themout to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch. What abody was hearing amongst them all the time was:
"Gimme a chaw 'v tobacker, Hank "
"Cain't; I hain't got but one chaw left. Ask Bill."
Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies andsays he ain't got none. Some of them kinds ofloafers never has a cent in the world, nor a chaw oftobacco of their own. They get all their chawing byborrowing; they say to a fellow, "I wisht you'd len'me a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompsonthe last chaw I had" -- which is a lie pretty mucheverytime; it don't fool nobody but a stranger; butJack ain't no stranger, so he says:
"YOU give him a chaw, did you? So did yoursister's cat's grandmother. You pay me back thechaws you've awready borry'd off'n me, Lafe Buckner,then I'll loan you one or two ton of it, and won'tcharge you no back intrust, nuther."
"Well, I DID pay you back some of it wunst."
"Yes, you did -- 'bout six chaws. You borry'dstore tobacker and paid back nigger-head."
Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellowsmostly chaws the natural leaf twisted. When theyborrow a chaw they don't generly cut it off with aknife, but set the plug in between their teeth, and gnawwith their teeth and tug at the plug with their handstill they get it in two; then sometimes the one thatowns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it'shanded back, and says, sarcastic:
"Here, gimme the CHAW, and you take the PLUG."
All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn'tnothing else BUT mud -- mud as black as tar and nighabout a foot deep in some places, and two or threeinches deep in ALL the places. The hogs loafed andgrunted around everywheres. You'd see a muddysow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the streetand whollop herself right down in the way, where folkshad to walk around her, and she'd stretch out and shuther eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milkingher, and look as happy as if she was on salary. Andpretty soon you'd hear a loafer sing out, "Hi! SOboy! sick him, Tige!" and away the sow would go,squealing most horrible, with a dog or two swinging toeach ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming; andthen you would see all the loafers get up and watchthe thing out of sight, and laugh at the fun and lookgrateful for the noise. Then they'd settle back againtill there was a dog fight. There couldn't anythingwake them up all over, and make them happy all over,like a dog fight -- unless it might be putting turpentineon a stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tinpan to his tail and see him run himself to death.
On the river front some of the houses was stickingout over the bank, and they was bowed and bent, andabout ready to tumble in, The people had moved outof them. The bank was caved away under one cornerof some others, and that corner was hanging over.People lived in them yet, but it was dangersome, be-cause sometimes a strip of land as wide as a housecaves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarterof a mile deep will start in and cave along and cavealong till it all caves into the river in one summer.Such a town as that has to be always moving back,and back, and back, because the river's always gnawingat it.
The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker andthicker was the wagons and horses in the streets, andmore coming all the time. Families fetched theirdinners with them from the country, and eat them inthe wagons. There was considerable whisky drinkinggoing on, and I seen three fights. By and by some-body sings out:
"Here comes old Boggs! -- in from the country forhis little old monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!"
All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they wasused to having fun out of Boggs. One of them says:
"Wonder who he's a-gwyne to chaw up this time.If he'd a-chawed up all the men he's ben a-gwyne tochaw up in the last twenty year he'd have considerableruputation now."
Another one says, "I wisht old Boggs 'd threatenme, 'cuz then I'd know I warn't gwyne to die for athousan' year."
Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whoopingand yelling like an Injun, and singing out:
"Cler the track, thar. I'm on the waw-path, andthe price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise."
He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; hewas over fifty year old, and had a very red face.Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassedhim, and he sassed back, and said he'd attend to themand lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn'twait now because he'd come to town to kill oldColonel Sherburn, and his motto was, "Meat first,and spoon vittles to top off on."
He see me, and rode up and says:
"Whar'd you come f'm, boy? You prepared todie?"
Then he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:
"He don't mean nothing; he's always a-carryin'on like that when he's drunk. He's the best natured-est old fool in Arkansaw -- never hurt nobody, drunknor sober."
Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, andbent his head down so he could see under the curtainof the awning and yells:
"Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meetthe man you've swindled. You're the houn' I'm after,and I'm a-gwyne to have you, too!"
And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything hecould lay his tongue to, and the whole street packedwith people listening and laughing and going on. Byand by a proud-looking man about fifty-five -- and hewas a heap the best dressed man in that town, too --steps out of the store, and the crowd drops back oneach side to let him come. He says to Boggs, mightyca'm and slow -- he says:
"I'm tired of this, but I'll endure it till one o'clock.Till one o'clock, mind -- no longer. If you open yourmouth against me only once after that time you can'ttravel so far but I will find you."
Then he turns and goes in. The crowd lookedmighty sober; nobody stirred, and there warn't nomore laughing. Boggs rode off blackguarding Sher-burn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; andpretty soon back he comes and stops before the store,still keeping it up. Some men crowded around himand tried to get him to shut up, but he wouldn't; theytold him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen min-utes, and so he MUST go home -- he must go rightaway. But it didn't do no good. He cussed awaywith all his might, and throwed his hat down in themud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he wenta-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a chance at himtried their best to coax him off of his horse so theycould lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't nouse -- up the street he would tear again, and giveSherburn another cussing. By and by somebody says:
"Go for his daughter! -- quick, go for his daughter;sometimes he'll listen to her. If anybody can persuadehim, she can."
So somebody started on a run. I walked downstreet a ways and stopped. In about five or ten min-utes here comes Boggs again, but not on his horse.He was a-reeling across the street towards me, bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt ofhis arms and hurrying him along. He was quiet, andlooked uneasy; and he warn't hanging back any, butwas doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebodysings out:
"Boggs!"
I looked over there to see who said it, and it wasthat Colonel Sherburn. He was standing perfectlystill in the street, and had a pistol raised in his righthand -- not aiming it, but holding it out with the barreltilted up towards the sky. The same second I see ayoung girl coming on the run, and two men with her.Boggs and the men turned round to see who calledhim, and when they see the pistol the men jumpedto one side, and the pistol-barrel come down slowand steady to a level -- both barrels cocked. Boggsthrows up both of his hands and says, "O Lord, don'tshoot!" Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggersback, clawing at the air -- bang! goes the second one,and he tumbles backwards on to the ground, heavyand solid, with his arms spread out. That young girlscreamed out and comes rushing, and down she throwsherself on her father, crying, and saying, "Oh, he'skilled him, he's killed him!" The crowd closed uparound them, and shouldered and jammed one another,with their necks stretched, trying to see, and peopleon the inside trying to shove them back and shouting,"Back, back! give him air, give him air!"
Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to theground, and turned around on his heels and walked off.
They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowdpressing around just the same, and the whole townfollowing, and I rushed and got a good place at thewindow, where I was close to him and could see in.They laid him on the floor and put one large Bibleunder his head, and opened another one and spread iton his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and Iseen where one of the bullets went in. He madeabout a dozen long gasps, his breast lifting the Bibleup when he drawed in his breath, and letting it downagain when he breathed it out -- and after that he laidstill; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughteraway from him, screaming and crying, and took heroff. She was about sixteen, and very sweet and gentlelooking, but awful pale and scared.
Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirm-ing and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get atthe window and have a look, but people that had theplaces wouldn't give them up, and folks behind themwas saying all the time, "Say, now, you've lookedenough, you fellows; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair foryou to stay thar all the time, and never give nobody achance; other folks has their rights as well as you."
There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out,thinking maybe there was going to be trouble. Thestreets was full, and everybody was excited. Every-body that seen the shooting was telling how it hap-pened, and there was a big crowd packed around eachone of these fellows, stretching their necks and listen-ing. One long, lanky man, with long hair and a bigwhite fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and acrooked-handled cane, marked out the places on theground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood,and the people following him around from one placeto t'other and watching everything he done, and bob-bing their heads to show they understood, and stoop-ing a little and resting their hands on their thighs towatch him mark the places on the ground with hiscane; and then he stood up straight and stiff whereSherburn had stood, frowning and having his hat-brimdown over his eyes, and sung out, "Boggs!" and thenfetched his cane down slow to a level, and says"Bang!" staggered backwards, says "Bang!" again,and fell down flat on his back. The people that hadseen the thing said he done it perfect; said it was justexactly the way it all happened. Then as much as adozen people got out their bottles and treated him.
Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought tobe lynched. In about a minute everybody was sayingit; so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatchingdown every clothes-line they come to to do the hang-ing with.
