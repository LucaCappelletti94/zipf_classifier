"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy andawkward as it can be. And so it makes it so rottendifficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain't no watch-man to be drugged -- now there OUGHT to be a watch-man. There ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mix-ture to. And there's Jim chained by one leg, with aten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you gotto do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain.And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the keyto the punkin-headed nigger, and don't send nobody towatch the nigger. Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be no use tryingto travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, dratit, Huck, it's the stupidest arrangement I ever see.You got to invent ALL the difficulties. Well, we can'thelp it; we got to do the best we can with the materialswe've got. Anyhow, there's one thing -- there's morehonor in getting him out through a lot of difficultiesand dangers, where there warn't one of them furnishedto you by the people who it was their duty to furnishthem, and you had to contrive them all out of yourown head. Now look at just that one thing of thelantern. When you come down to the cold facts, wesimply got to LET ON that a lantern's resky. Why, wecould work with a torchlight procession if we wantedto, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got tohunt up something to make a saw out of the firstchance we get."
"What do we want of a saw?"
"What do we WANT of a saw? Hain't we got tosaw the leg of Jim's bed off, so as to get the chainloose?"
"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bed-stead and slip the chain off."
"Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn. YouCAN get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at athing. Why, hain't you ever read any books at all?-- Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chel-leeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Whoever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that? No; the way all the best authori-ties does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it justso, and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, andput some dirt and grease around the sawed place so thevery keenest seneskal can't see no sign of it's beingsawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then,the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down shegoes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothingto do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shindown it, break your leg in the moat -- because a ropeladder is nineteen foot too short, you know -- and there'syour horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoopyou up and fling you across a saddle, and away you goto your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is.It's gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to thiscabin. If we get time, the night of the escape,we'll dig one."
I says:
"What do we want of a moat when we're going tosnake him out from under the cabin?"
But he never heard me. He had forgot me andeverything else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking.Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighsagain, and says:
"No, it wouldn't do -- there ain't necessity enoughfor it."
"For what?" I says.
"Why, to saw Jim's leg off," he says.
"Good land!" I says; "why, there ain't NO neces-sity for it. And what would you want to saw his legoff for, anyway?"
"Well, some of the best authorities has done it.They couldn't get the chain off, so they just cut theirhand off and shoved. And a leg would be better still.But we got to let that go. There ain't necessityenough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, andwouldn't understand the reasons for it, and how it's thecustom in Europe; so we'll let it go. But there's onething -- he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up oursheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. Andwe can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done thatway. And I've et worse pies."
"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jimain't got no use for a rope ladder."
"He HAS got use for it. How YOU talk, you bettersay; you don't know nothing about it. He's GOT tohave a rope ladder; they all do."
"What in the nation can he DO with it?"
"DO with it? He can hide it in his bed, can't he?"That's what they all do; and HE'S got to, too.Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do anythingthat's regular; you want to be starting something freshall the time. S'pose he DON'T do nothing with it? ain'tit there in his bed, for a clew, after he's gone? anddon't you reckon they'll want clews? Of course theywill. And you wouldn't leave them any? That wouldbe a PRETTY howdy-do, WOULDN'T it! I never heard ofsuch a thing."
"Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he'sgot to have it, all right, let him have it; because Idon't wish to go back on no regulations; but there'sone thing, Tom Sawyer -- if we go to tearing up oursheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to getinto trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you'reborn. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladderdon't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and isjust as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a strawtick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim,he ain't had no experience, and so he don't care whatkind of a --"
"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant asyou I'd keep still -- that's what I'D do. Who everheard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-barkladder? Why, it's perfectly ridiculous."
"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but ifyou'll take my advice, you'll let me borrow a sheet offof the clothesline."
He said that would do. And that gave him anotheridea, and he says:
"Borrow a shirt, too."
"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"
"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on."
"Journal your granny -- JIM can't write."
"S'pose he CAN'T write -- he can make marks onthe shirt, can't he, if we make him a pen out ofan old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?"
"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a gooseand make him a better one; and quicker, too."
"PRISONERS don't have geese running around thedonjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins. TheyALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest, toughest,troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or some-thing like that they can get their hands on; and ittakes them weeks and weeks and months and monthsto file it out, too, because they've got to do it by rub-bing it on the wall. THEY wouldn't use a goose-quill ifthey had it. It ain't regular."
"Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?"
"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; butthat's the common sort and women; the best authori-ties uses their own blood. Jim can do that; and whenhe wants to send any little common ordinary mysteriousmessage to let the world know where he's captivated,he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a forkand throw it out of the window. The Iron Maskalways done that, and it's a blame' good way, too."
"Jim ain't got no tin plates. They feed him in apan."
"That ain't nothing; we can get him some."
"Can't nobody READ his plates."
"That ain't got anything to DO with it, Huck Finn.All HE'S got to do is to write on the plate and throwit out. You don't HAVE to be able to read it. Why,half the time you can't read anything a prisoner writeson a tin plate, or anywhere else."
"Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?"
"Why, blame it all, it ain't the PRISONER'S plates."
"But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?"
"Well, spos'n it is? What does the PRISONER carewhose --"
He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing. So we cleared out for the house.
Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and awhite shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an oldsack and put them in it, and we went down and got thefox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing,because that was what pap always called it; but Tomsaid it warn't borrowing, it was stealing. He said wewas representing prisoners; and prisoners don't carehow they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don'tblame them for it, either. It ain't no crime in aprisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with,Tom said; it's his right; and so, as long as we wasrepresenting a prisoner, we had a perfect right to stealanything on this place we had the least use for to getourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn'tprisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobodybut a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn'ta prisoner. So we allowed we would steal every-thing there was that come handy. And yet he madea mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole awatermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and hemade me go and give the niggers a dime without tellingthem what it was for. Tom said that what he meantwas, we could steal anything we NEEDED. Well, I says,I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn't need itto get out of prison with; there's where the differencewas. He said if I'd a wanted it to hide a knife in, andsmuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would abeen all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn'tsee no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I gotto set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctionslike that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.
Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning tilleverybody was settled down to business, and nobodyin sight around the yard; then Tom he carried thesack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keepwatch. By and by he come out, and we went and setdown on the woodpile to talk. He says:
"Everything's all right now except tools; and that'seasy fixed."
"Tools?" I says.
"Yes."
"Tools for what?"
"Why, to dig with. We ain't a-going to GNAW himout, are we?"
"Ain't them old crippled picks and things in theregood enough to dig a nigger out with?" I says.
He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make abody cry, and says:
"Huck Finn, did you EVER hear of a prisoner havingpicks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences inhis wardrobe to dig himself out with? Now I want toask you -- if you got any reasonableness in you at all-- what kind of a show would THAT give him to be ahero? Why, they might as well lend him the key anddone with it. Picks and shovels -- why, they wouldn'tfurnish 'em to a king."
"Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picksand shovels, what do we want?"
"A couple of case-knives."
"To dig the foundations out from under that cabinwith?"
"Yes."
"Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."
"It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it'sthe RIGHT way -- and it's the regular way. And thereain't no OTHER way, that ever I heard of, and I've readall the books that gives any information about thesethings. They always dig out with a case-knife -- andnot through dirt, mind you; generly it's through solidrock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks,and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of themprisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, inthe harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way;how long was HE at it, you reckon?"
"I don't know."
"Well, guess."
"I don't know. A month and a half."
"THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR -- and he come out in China.THAT'S the kind. I wish the bottom of THIS fortresswas solid rock."
"JIM don't know nobody in China."
"What's THAT got to do with it? Neither did thatother fellow. But you're always a-wandering off on aside issue. Why can't you stick to the main point?"
"All right -- I don't care where he comes out, so heCOMES out; and Jim don't, either, I reckon. Butthere's one thing, anyway -- Jim's too old to be dugout with a case-knife. He won't last."
"Yes he will LAST, too. You don't reckon it's goingto take thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRTfoundation, do you?"
"How long will it take, Tom?"
"Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to,because it mayn't take very long for Uncle Silas to hearfrom down there by New Orleans. He'll hear Jim ain'tfrom there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim,or something like that. So we can't resk being as longdigging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckonwe ought to be a couple of years; but we can't.Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this:that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; andafter that, we can LET ON, to ourselves, that we was atit thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out andrush him away the first time there's an alarm. Yes, Ireckon that 'll be the best way."
"Now, there's SENSE in that," I says. "Letting ondon't cost nothing; letting on ain't no trouble; and ifit's any object, I don't mind letting on we was at it ahundred and fifty year. It wouldn't strain me none,after I got my hand in. So I'll mosey along now, andsmouch a couple of case-knives."
"Smouch three," he says; "we want one to makea saw out of."
"Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejestit," I says, "there's an old rusty saw-blade aroundyonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind thesmoke-house."
He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, andsays:
"It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.Run along and smouch the knives -- three of them."So I done it.
