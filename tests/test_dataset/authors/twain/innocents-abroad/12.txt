We have come five hundred miles by rail through the heart of France.What a bewitching land it is! What a garden! Surely the leagues ofbright green lawns are swept and brushed and watered every day and theirgrasses trimmed by the barber. Surely the hedges are shaped and measuredand their symmetry preserved by the most architectural of gardeners.Surely the long straight rows of stately poplars that divide thebeautiful landscape like the squares of a checker-board are set with lineand plummet, and their uniform height determined with a spirit level.Surely the straight, smooth, pure white turnpikes are jack-planed andsandpapered every day. How else are these marvels of symmetry,cleanliness, and order attained? It is wonderful. There are nounsightly stone walls and never a fence of any kind. There is no dirt,no decay, no rubbish anywhere--nothing that even hints at untidiness--nothing that ever suggests neglect. All is orderly and beautiful--everything is charming to the eye.
We had such glimpses of the Rhone gliding along between its grassy banks;of cosy cottages buried in flowers and shrubbery; of quaint old red-tiledvillages with mossy medieval cathedrals looming out of their midst; ofwooded hills with ivy-grown towers and turrets of feudal castlesprojecting above the foliage; such glimpses of Paradise, it seemed to us,such visions of fabled fairyland!
We knew then what the poet meant when he sang of: "--thy cornfieldsgreen, and sunny vines, O pleasant land of France!"
And it is a pleasant land. No word describes it so felicitously as thatone. They say there is no word for "home" in the French language. Well,considering that they have the article itself in such an attractiveaspect, they ought to manage to get along without the word. Let us notwaste too much pity on "homeless" France. I have observed that Frenchmenabroad seldom wholly give up the idea of going back to France some timeor other. I am not surprised at it now.
We are not infatuated with these French railway cars, though. We tookfirst-class passage, not because we wished to attract attention by doinga thing which is uncommon in Europe but because we could make our journeyquicker by so doing. It is hard to make railroading pleasant in anycountry. It is too tedious. Stagecoaching is infinitely moredelightful. Once I crossed the plains and deserts and mountains of theWest in a stagecoach, from the Missouri line to California, and sincethen all my pleasure trips must be measured to that rare holiday frolic.Two thousand miles of ceaseless rush and rattle and clatter, by night andby day, and never a weary moment, never a lapse of interest! The firstseven hundred miles a level continent, its grassy carpet greener andsofter and smoother than any sea and figured with designs fitted to itsmagnitude--the shadows of the clouds. Here were no scenes but summerscenes, and no disposition inspired by them but to lie at full length onthe mail sacks in the grateful breeze and dreamily smoke the pipe ofpeace--what other, where all was repose and contentment? In coolmornings, before the sun was fairly up, it was worth a lifetime of citytoiling and moiling to perch in the foretop with the driver and see thesix mustangs scamper under the sharp snapping of the whip that nevertouched them; to scan the blue distances of a world that knew no lordsbut us; to cleave the wind with uncovered head and feel the sluggishpulses rousing to the spirit of a speed that pretended to the resistlessrush of a typhoon! Then thirteen hundred miles of desert solitudes; oflimitless panoramas of bewildering perspective; of mimic cities, ofpinnacled cathedrals, of massive fortresses, counterfeited in the eternalrocks and splendid with the crimson and gold of the setting sun; of dizzyaltitudes among fog-wreathed peaks and never-melting snows, wherethunders and lightnings and tempests warred magnificently at our feet andthe storm clouds above swung their shredded banners in our very faces!But I forgot. I am in elegant France now, and not scurrying through thegreat South Pass and the Wind River Mountains, among antelopes andbuffaloes and painted Indians on the warpath. It is not meet that Ishould make too disparaging comparisons between humdrum travel on arailway and that royal summer flight across a continent in a stagecoach.I meant in the beginning to say that railway journeying is tedious andtiresome, and so it is--though at the time I was thinking particularly ofa dismal fifty-hour pilgrimage between New York and St. Louis. Of courseour trip through France was not really tedious because all its scenes andexperiences were new and strange; but as Dan says, it had its"discrepancies."
The cars are built in compartments that hold eight persons each. Eachcompartment is partially subdivided, and so there are two tolerablydistinct parties of four in it. Four face the other four. The seats andbacks are thickly padded and cushioned and are very comfortable; you cansmoke if you wish; there are no bothersome peddlers; you are saved theinfliction of a multitude of disagreeable fellow passengers. So far, sowell. But then the conductor locks you in when the train starts; thereis no water to drink in the car; there is no heating apparatus for nighttravel; if a drunken rowdy should get in, you could not remove a matterof twenty seats from him or enter another car; but above all, if you areworn out and must sleep, you must sit up and do it in naps, with crampedlegs and in a torturing misery that leaves you withered and lifeless thenext day--for behold they have not that culmination of all charity andhuman kindness, a sleeping car, in all France. I prefer the Americansystem. It has not so many grievous "discrepancies."
In France, all is clockwork, all is order. They make no mistakes. Everythird man wears a uniform, and whether he be a marshal of the empire or abrakeman, he is ready and perfectly willing to answer all your questionswith tireless politeness, ready to tell you which car to take, yea, andready to go and put you into it to make sure that you shall not goastray. You cannot pass into the waiting room of the depot till you havesecured your ticket, and you cannot pass from its only exit till thetrain is at its threshold to receive you. Once on board, the train willnot start till your ticket has been examined--till every passenger'sticket has been inspected. This is chiefly for your own good. If by anypossibility you have managed to take the wrong train, you will be handedover to a polite official who will take you whither you belong and bestowyou with many an affable bow. Your ticket will be inspected every nowand then along the route, and when it is time to change cars you willknow it. You are in the hands of officials who zealously study yourwelfare and your interest, instead of turning their talents to theinvention of new methods of discommoding and snubbing you, as is veryoften the main employment of that exceedingly self-satisfied monarch, therailroad conductor of America.
But the happiest regulation in French railway government is--thirtyminutes to dinner! No five-minute boltings of flabby rolls, muddycoffee, questionable eggs, gutta-percha beef, and pies whose conceptionand execution are a dark and bloody mystery to all save the cook thatcreated them! No, we sat calmly down--it was in old Dijon, which is soeasy to spell and so impossible to pronounce except when you civilize itand call it Demijohn--and poured out rich Burgundian wines and munchedcalmly through a long table d'hote bill of fare, snail patties, deliciousfruits and all, then paid the trifle it cost and stepped happily aboardthe train again, without once cursing the railroad company. A rareexperience and one to be treasured forever.
They say they do not have accidents on these French roads, and I think itmust be true. If I remember rightly, we passed high above wagon roads orthrough tunnels under them, but never crossed them on their own level.About every quarter of a mile, it seemed to me, a man came out and heldup a club till the train went by, to signify that everything was safeahead. Switches were changed a mile in advance by pulling a wire ropethat passed along the ground by the rail, from station to station.Signals for the day and signals for the night gave constant and timelynotice of the position of switches.
No, they have no railroad accidents to speak of in France. But why?Because when one occurs, somebody has to hang for it! Not hang, maybe,but be punished at least with such vigor of emphasis as to makenegligence a thing to be shuddered at by railroad officials for many aday thereafter. "No blame attached to the officers"--that lying anddisaster-breeding verdict so common to our softhearted juries is seldomrendered in France. If the trouble occurred in the conductor'sdepartment, that officer must suffer if his subordinate cannot be provenguilty; if in the engineer's department and the case be similar, theengineer must answer.
The Old Travelers--those delightful parrots who have "been here before"and know more about the country than Louis Napoleon knows now or everwill know--tell us these things, and we believe them because they arepleasant things to believe and because they are plausible and savor ofthe rigid subjection to law and order which we behold about useverywhere.
But we love the Old Travelers. We love to hear them prate and drivel andlie. We can tell them the moment we see them. They always throw out afew feelers; they never cast themselves adrift till they have soundedevery individual and know that he has not traveled. Then they open theirthrottle valves, and how they do brag, and sneer, and swell, and soar,and blaspheme the sacred name of Truth! Their central idea, their grandaim, is to subjugate you, keep you down, make you feel insignificant andhumble in the blaze of their cosmopolitan glory! They will not let youknow anything. They sneer at your most inoffensive suggestions; theylaugh unfeelingly at your treasured dreams of foreign lands; they brandthe statements of your traveled aunts and uncles as the stupidestabsurdities; they deride your most trusted authors and demolish the fairimages they have set up for your willing worship with the pitilessferocity of the fanatic iconoclast! But still I love the Old Travelers.I love them for their witless platitudes, for their supernatural abilityto bore, for their delightful asinine vanity, for their luxuriantfertility of imagination, for their startling, their brilliant, theiroverwhelming mendacity!
By Lyons and the Saone (where we saw the lady of Lyons and thought littleof her comeliness), by Villa Franca, Tonnere, venerable Sens, Melun,Fontainebleau, and scores of other beautiful cities, we swept, alwaysnoting the absence of hog-wallows, broken fences, cow lots, unpaintedhouses, and mud, and always noting, as well, the presence of cleanliness,grace, taste in adorning and beautifying, even to the disposition of atree or the turning of a hedge, the marvel of roads in perfect repair,void of ruts and guiltless of even an inequality of surface--we bowledalong, hour after hour, that brilliant summer day, and as nightfallapproached we entered a wilderness of odorous flowers and shrubbery, spedthrough it, and then, excited, delighted, and half persuaded that we wereonly the sport of a beautiful dream, lo, we stood in magnificent Paris!
What excellent order they kept about that vast depot! There was nofrantic crowding and jostling, no shouting and swearing, and noswaggering intrusion of services by rowdy hackmen. These latter gentrystood outside--stood quietly by their long line of vehicles and saidnever a word. A kind of hackman general seemed to have the whole matterof transportation in his hands. He politely received the passengers andushered them to the kind of conveyance they wanted, and told the driverwhere to deliver them. There was no "talking back," no dissatisfactionabout overcharging, no grumbling about anything. In a little while wewere speeding through the streets of Paris and delightfully recognizingcertain names and places with which books had long ago made us familiar.It was like meeting an old friend when we read Rue de Rivoli on thestreet corner; we knew the genuine vast palace of the Louvre as well aswe knew its picture; when we passed by the Column of July we needed noone to tell us what it was or to remind us that on its site once stoodthe grim Bastille, that grave of human hopes and happiness, that dismalprison house within whose dungeons so many young faces put on thewrinkles of age, so many proud spirits grew humble, so many brave heartsbroke.
We secured rooms at the hotel, or rather, we had three beds put into oneroom, so that we might be together, and then we went out to a restaurant,just after lamplighting, and ate a comfortable, satisfactory, lingeringdinner. It was a pleasure to eat where everything was so tidy, the foodso well cooked, the waiters so polite, and the coming and departingcompany so moustached, so frisky, so affable, so fearfully andwonderfully Frenchy! All the surroundings were gay and enlivening. Twohundred people sat at little tables on the sidewalk, sipping wine andcoffee; the streets were thronged with light vehicles and with joyouspleasure-seekers; there was music in the air, life and action all aboutus, and a conflagration of gaslight everywhere!
After dinner we felt like seeing such Parisian specialties as we mightsee without distressing exertion, and so we sauntered through thebrilliant streets and looked at the dainty trifles in variety stores andjewelry shops. Occasionally, merely for the pleasure of being cruel, weput unoffending Frenchmen on the rack with questions framed in theincomprehensible jargon of their native language, and while they writhedwe impaled them, we peppered them, we scarified them, with their own vileverbs and participles.
We noticed that in the jewelry stores they had some of the articlesmarked "gold" and some labeled "imitation." We wondered at thisextravagance of honesty and inquired into the matter. We were informedthat inasmuch as most people are not able to tell false gold from thegenuine article, the government compels jewelers to have their gold workassayed and stamped officially according to its fineness and theirimitation work duly labeled with the sign of its falsity. They told usthe jewelers would not dare to violate this law, and that whatever astranger bought in one of their stores might be depended upon as beingstrictly what it was represented to be. Verily, a wonderful land isFrance!
Then we hunted for a barber-shop. From earliest infancy it had beena cherished ambition of mine to be shaved some day in a palatialbarber-shop in Paris. I wished to recline at full length in a cushionedinvalid chair, with pictures about me and sumptuous furniture; withfrescoed walls and gilded arches above me and vistas of Corinthiancolumns stretching far before me; with perfumes of Araby to intoxicatemy senses and the slumbrous drone of distant noises to soothe me tosleep. At the end of an hour I would wake up regretfully and find myface as smooth and as soft as an infant's. Departing, I would lift myhands above that barber's head and say, "Heaven bless you, my son!"
So we searched high and low, for a matter of two hours, but never abarber-shop could we see. We saw only wig-making establishments, withshocks of dead and repulsive hair bound upon the heads of painted waxenbrigands who stared out from glass boxes upon the passer-by with theirstony eyes and scared him with the ghostly white of their countenances.We shunned these signs for a time, but finally we concluded that thewig-makers must of necessity be the barbers as well, since we could findno single legitimate representative of the fraternity. We entered andasked, and found that it was even so.
I said I wanted to be shaved. The barber inquired where my room was. Isaid never mind where my room was, I wanted to be shaved--there, on thespot. The doctor said he would be shaved also. Then there was anexcitement among those two barbers! There was a wild consultation, andafterwards a hurrying to and fro and a feverish gathering up of razorsfrom obscure places and a ransacking for soap. Next they took us into alittle mean, shabby back room; they got two ordinary sitting-room chairsand placed us in them with our coats on. My old, old dream of blissvanished into thin air!
I sat bolt upright, silent, sad, and solemn. One of the wig-makingvillains lathered my face for ten terrible minutes and finished byplastering a mass of suds into my mouth. I expelled the nasty stuff witha strong English expletive and said, "Foreigner, beware!" Then thisoutlaw strapped his razor on his boot, hovered over me ominously for sixfearful seconds, and then swooped down upon me like the genius ofdestruction. The first rake of his razor loosened the very hide from myface and lifted me out of the chair. I stormed and raved, and the otherboys enjoyed it. Their beards are not strong and thick. Let us draw thecurtain over this harrowing scene.
Suffice it that I submitted and went through with the cruel infliction ofa shave by a French barber; tears of exquisite agony coursed down mycheeks now and then, but I survived. Then the incipient assassin held abasin of water under my chin and slopped its contents over my face, andinto my bosom, and down the back of my neck, with a mean pretense ofwashing away the soap and blood. He dried my features with a towel andwas going to comb my hair, but I asked to be excused. I said, withwithering irony, that it was sufficient to be skinned--I declined to bescalped.
I went away from there with my handkerchief about my face, and never,never, never desired to dream of palatial Parisian barber-shops anymore.The truth is, as I believe I have since found out, that they have nobarber shops worthy of the name in Paris--and no barbers, either, forthat matter. The impostor who does duty as a barber brings his pans andnapkins and implements of torture to your residence and deliberatelyskins you in your private apartments. Ah, I have suffered, suffered,suffered, here in Paris, but never mind--the time is coming when I shallhave a dark and bloody revenge. Someday a Parisian barber will come tomy room to skin me, and from that day forth that barber will never beheard of more.
At eleven o'clock we alighted upon a sign which manifestly referred tobilliards. Joy! We had played billiards in the Azores with balls thatwere not round and on an ancient table that was very little smoother thana brick pavement--one of those wretched old things with dead cushions,and with patches in the faded cloth and invisible obstructions that madethe balls describe the most astonishing and unsuspected angles andperform feats in the way of unlooked-for and almost impossible"scratches" that were perfectly bewildering. We had played at Gibraltarwith balls the size of a walnut, on a table like a public square--and inboth instances we achieved far more aggravation than amusement. Weexpected to fare better here, but we were mistaken. The cushions were agood deal higher than the balls, and as the balls had a fashion of alwaysstopping under the cushions, we accomplished very little in the way ofcaroms. The cushions were hard and unelastic, and the cues were socrooked that in making a shot you had to allow for the curve or you wouldinfallibly put the "English" on the wrong side of the hall. Dan was tomark while the doctor and I played. At the end of an hour neither of ushad made a count, and so Dan was tired of keeping tally with nothing totally, and we were heated and angry and disgusted. We paid the heavybill--about six cents--and said we would call around sometime when we hada week to spend, and finish the game.
We adjourned to one of those pretty cafes and took supper and tested thewines of the country, as we had been instructed to do, and found themharmless and unexciting. They might have been exciting, however, if wehad chosen to drink a sufficiency of them.
To close our first day in Paris cheerfully and pleasantly, we now soughtour grand room in the Grand Hotel du Louvre and climbed into oursumptuous bed to read and smoke--but alas!
 It was pitiful, In a whole city-full, Gas we had none.
No gas to read by--nothing but dismal candles. It was a shame. We triedto map out excursions for the morrow; we puzzled over French "guides toParis"; we talked disjointedly in a vain endeavor to make head or tail ofthe wild chaos of the day's sights and experiences; we subsided toindolent smoking; we gaped and yawned and stretched--then feebly wonderedif we were really and truly in renowned Paris, and drifted drowsily awayinto that vast mysterious void which men call sleep.
