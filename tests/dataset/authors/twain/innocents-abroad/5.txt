Taking it "by and large," as the sailors say, we had a pleasant ten days'run from New York to the Azores islands--not a fast run, for the distanceis only twenty-four hundred miles, but a right pleasant one in the main.True, we had head winds all the time, and several stormy experienceswhich sent fifty percent of the passengers to bed sick and made the shiplook dismal and deserted--stormy experiences that all will remember whoweathered them on the tumbling deck and caught the vast sheets of spraythat every now and then sprang high in air from the weather bow and sweptthe ship like a thunder-shower; but for the most part we had balmy summerweather and nights that were even finer than the days. We had thephenomenon of a full moon located just in the same spot in the heavens atthe same hour every night. The reason of this singular conduct on thepart of the moon did not occur to us at first, but it did afterward whenwe reflected that we were gaining about twenty minutes every day becausewe were going east so fast--we gained just about enough every day to keepalong with the moon. It was becoming an old moon to the friends we hadleft behind us, but to us Joshuas it stood still in the same place andremained always the same.
Young Mr. Blucher, who is from the Far West and is on his first voyage,was a good deal worried by the constantly changing "ship time." He wasproud of his new watch at first and used to drag it out promptly wheneight bells struck at noon, but he came to look after a while as if hewere losing confidence in it. Seven days out from New York he came ondeck and said with great decision:
"This thing's a swindle!"
"What's a swindle?"
"Why, this watch. I bought her out in Illinois--gave $150 for her--and Ithought she was good. And, by George, she is good onshore, but somehowshe don't keep up her lick here on the water--gets seasick may be. Sheskips; she runs along regular enough till half-past eleven, and then, allof a sudden, she lets down. I've set that old regulator up faster andfaster, till I've shoved it clear around, but it don't do any good; shejust distances every watch in the ship, and clatters along in a waythat's astonishing till it is noon, but them eight bells always gets inabout ten minutes ahead of her anyway. I don't know what to do with hernow. She's doing all she can--she's going her best gait, but it won'tsave her. Now, don't you know, there ain't a watch in the ship that'smaking better time than she is, but what does it signify? When you hearthem eight bells you'll find her just about ten minutes short of herscore sure."
The ship was gaining a full hour every three days, and this fellow wastrying to make his watch go fast enough to keep up to her. But, as hehad said, he had pushed the regulator up as far as it would go, and thewatch was "on its best gait," and so nothing was left him but to fold hishands and see the ship beat the race. We sent him to the captain, and heexplained to him the mystery of "ship time" and set his troubled mind atrest. This young man asked a great many questions about seasicknessbefore we left, and wanted to know what its characteristics were and howhe was to tell when he had it. He found out.
We saw the usual sharks, blackfish, porpoises, &c., of course, and by andby large schools of Portuguese men-of-war were added to the regular listof sea wonders. Some of them were white and some of a brilliant carminecolor. The nautilus is nothing but a transparent web of jelly thatspreads itself to catch the wind, and has fleshy-looking strings a footor two long dangling from it to keep it steady in the water. It is anaccomplished sailor and has good sailor judgment. It reefs its sail whena storm threatens or the wind blows pretty hard, and furls it entirelyand goes down when a gale blows. Ordinarily it keeps its sail wet and ingood sailing order by turning over and dipping it in the water for amoment. Seamen say the nautilus is only found in these waters betweenthe 35th and 45th parallels of latitude.
At three o'clock on the morning of the twenty-first of June, we wereawakened and notified that the Azores islands were in sight. I said Idid not take any interest in islands at three o'clock in the morning.But another persecutor came, and then another and another, and finallybelieving that the general enthusiasm would permit no one to slumber inpeace, I got up and went sleepily on deck. It was five and a halfo'clock now, and a raw, blustering morning. The passengers were huddledabout the smoke-stacks and fortified behind ventilators, and all werewrapped in wintry costumes and looking sleepy and unhappy in the pitilessgale and the drenching spray.
The island in sight was Flores. It seemed only a mountain of mudstanding up out of the dull mists of the sea. But as we bore down uponit the sun came out and made it a beautiful picture--a mass of greenfarms and meadows that swelled up to a height of fifteen hundred feet andmingled its upper outlines with the clouds. It was ribbed with sharp,steep ridges and cloven with narrow canyons, and here and there on theheights, rocky upheavals shaped themselves into mimic battlements andcastles; and out of rifted clouds came broad shafts of sunlight, thatpainted summit, and slope and glen, with bands of fire, and left belts ofsomber shade between. It was the aurora borealis of the frozen poleexiled to a summer land!
We skirted around two-thirds of the island, four miles from shore, andall the opera glasses in the ship were called into requisition to settledisputes as to whether mossy spots on the uplands were groves of trees orgroves of weeds, or whether the white villages down by the sea werereally villages or only the clustering tombstones of cemeteries. Finallywe stood to sea and bore away for San Miguel, and Flores shortly became adome of mud again and sank down among the mists, and disappeared. But tomany a seasick passenger it was good to see the green hills again, andall were more cheerful after this episode than anybody could haveexpected them to be, considering how sinfully early they had gotten up.
But we had to change our purpose about San Miguel, for a storm came upabout noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sensedictated a run for shelter. Therefore we steered for the nearest islandof the group--Fayal (the people there pronounce it Fy-all, and put theaccent on the first syllable). We anchored in the open roadstead ofHorta, half a mile from the shore. The town has eight thousand to tenthousand inhabitants. Its snow-white houses nestle cosily in a sea offresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or moreattractive. It sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills which arethree hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefully cultivated clearto their summits--not a foot of soil left idle. Every farm and everyacre is cut up into little square inclosures by stone walls, whose dutyit is to protect the growing products from the destructive gales thatblow there. These hundreds of green squares, marked by their black lavawalls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards.
The islands belong to Portugal, and everything in Fayal has Portuguesecharacteristics about it. But more of that anon. A swarm of swarthy,noisy, lying, shoulder-shrugging, gesticulating Portuguese boatmen, withbrass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship'ssides, and various parties of us contracted with them to take us ashoreat so much a head, silver coin of any country. We landed under the wallsof a little fort, armed with batteries of twelve-and-thirty-two-pounders,which Horta considered a most formidable institution, but if we were everto get after it with one of our turreted monitors, they would have tomove it out in the country if they wanted it where they could go and findit again when they needed it. The group on the pier was a rusty one--menand women, and boys and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed andunclean, and by instinct, education, and profession beggars. Theytrooped after us, and never more while we tarried in Fayal did we get ridof them. We walked up the middle of the principal street, and thesevermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us; and every momentexcited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back,just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on hisadvertising trip from street to street. It was very flattering to me tobe part of the material for such a sensation. Here and there in thedoorways we saw women with fashionable Portuguese hoods on. This hood isof thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is amarvel of ugliness. It stands up high and spreads far abroad, and isunfathomably deep. It fits like a circus tent, and a woman's head ishidden away in it like the man's who prompts the singers from his tinshed in the stage of an opera. There is no particle of trimming aboutthis monstrous capote, as they call it--it is just a plain, uglydead-blue mass of sail, and a woman can't go within eight points of thewind with one of them on; she has to go before the wind or not at all.The general style of the capote is the same in all the islands, and willremain so for the next ten thousand years, but each island shapes itscapotes just enough differently from the others to enable an observer totell at a glance what particular island a lady hails from.
The Portuguese pennies, or reis (pronounced rays), are prodigious. Ittakes one thousand reis to make a dollar, and all financial estimates aremade in reis. We did not know this until after we had found it outthrough Blucher. Blucher said he was so happy and so grateful to be onsolid land once more that he wanted to give a feast--said he had heard itwas a cheap land, and he was bound to have a grand banquet. He invitednine of us, and we ate an excellent dinner at the principal hotel. Inthe midst of the jollity produced by good cigars, good wine, and passableanecdotes, the landlord presented his bill. Blucher glanced at it andhis countenance fell. He took another look to assure himself that hissenses had not deceived him and then read the items aloud, in a falteringvoice, while the roses in his cheeks turned to ashes:
"'Ten dinners, at 600 reis, 6,000 reis!' Ruin and desolation!
"'Twenty-five cigars, at 100 reis, 2,500 reis!' Oh, my sainted mother!
"'Eleven bottles of wine, at 1,200 reis, 13,200 reis!' Be with us all!
"'TOTAL, TWENTY-ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED REIS!' The suffering Moses!There ain't money enough in the ship to pay that bill! Go--leave me tomy misery, boys, I am a ruined community."
I think it was the blankest-looking party I ever saw. Nobody could say aword. It was as if every soul had been stricken dumb. Wine glassesdescended slowly to the table, their contents untasted. Cigars droppedunnoticed from nerveless fingers. Each man sought his neighbor's eye,but found in it no ray of hope, no encouragement. At last the fearfulsilence was broken. The shadow of a desperate resolve settled uponBlucher's countenance like a cloud, and he rose up and said:
"Landlord, this is a low, mean swindle, and I'll never, never stand it.Here's a hundred and fifty dollars, Sir, and it's all you'll get--I'llswim in blood before I'll pay a cent more."
Our spirits rose and the landlord's fell--at least we thought so; he wasconfused, at any rate, notwithstanding he had not understood a word thathad been said. He glanced from the little pile of gold pieces to Blucherseveral times and then went out. He must have visited an American, forwhen he returned, he brought back his bill translated into a languagethat a Christian could understand--thus: 
10 dinners, 6,000 reis, or .  .  .$6.00
25 cigars, 2,500 reis, or .  .  .  2.50
11 bottles wine, 13,200 reis, or  13.20
Total 21,700 reis, or .  .  .  . $21.70

Happiness reigned once more in Blucher's dinner party. More refreshmentswere ordered.
