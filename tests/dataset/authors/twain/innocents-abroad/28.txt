From the sanguinary sports of the Holy Inquisition; the slaughter of theColiseum; and the dismal tombs of the Catacombs, I naturally pass to thepicturesque horrors of the Capuchin Convent. We stopped a moment in asmall chapel in the church to admire a picture of St. Michael vanquishingSatan--a picture which is so beautiful that I can not but think itbelongs to the reviled "Renaissance," notwithstanding I believe they toldus one of the ancient old masters painted it--and then we descended intothe vast vault underneath.
Here was a spectacle for sensitive nerves! Evidently the old masters hadbeen at work in this place. There were six divisions in the apartment,and each division was ornamented with a style of decoration peculiar toitself--and these decorations were in every instance formed of humanbones! There were shapely arches, built wholly of thigh bones; therewere startling pyramids, built wholly of grinning skulls; there werequaint architectural structures of various kinds, built of shin bones andthe bones of the arm; on the wall were elaborate frescoes, whose curvingvines were made of knotted human vertebrae; whose delicate tendrils weremade of sinews and tendons; whose flowers were formed of knee-caps andtoe-nails. Every lasting portion of the human frame was represented inthese intricate designs (they were by Michael Angelo, I think,) and therewas a careful finish about the work, and an attention to details thatbetrayed the artist's love of his labors as well as his schooled ability.I asked the good-natured monk who accompanied us, who did this? And hesaid, "We did it"--meaning himself and his brethren up stairs. I couldsee that the old friar took a high pride in his curious show. We madehim talkative by exhibiting an interest we never betrayed to guides.
"Who were these people?"
"We--up stairs--Monks of the Capuchin order--my brethren."
"How many departed monks were required to upholster these six parlors?"
"These are the bones of four thousand."
"It took a long time to get enough?"
"Many, many centuries."
"Their different parts are well separated--skulls in one room, legs inanother, ribs in another--there would be stirring times here for a whileif the last trump should blow. Some of the brethren might get hold ofthe wrong leg, in the confusion, and the wrong skull, and find themselveslimping, and looking through eyes that were wider apart or closertogether than they were used to. You can not tell any of these partiesapart, I suppose?"
"Oh, yes, I know many of them."
He put his finger on a skull. "This was Brother Anselmo--dead threehundred years--a good man."
He touched another. "This was Brother Alexander--dead two hundred andeighty years. This was Brother Carlo--dead about as long."
Then he took a skull and held it in his hand, and looked reflectivelyupon it, after the manner of the grave-digger when he discourses ofYorick.
"This," he said, "was Brother Thomas. He was a young prince, the scionof a proud house that traced its lineage back to the grand old days ofRome well nigh two thousand years ago. He loved beneath his estate. Hisfamily persecuted him; persecuted the girl, as well. They drove her fromRome; he followed; he sought her far and wide; he found no trace of her.He came back and offered his broken heart at our altar and his weary lifeto the service of God. But look you. Shortly his father died, andlikewise his mother. The girl returned, rejoicing. She sought everywhere for him whose eyes had used to look tenderly into hers out of thispoor skull, but she could not find him. At last, in this coarse garb wewear, she recognized him in the street. He knew her. It was too late.He fell where he stood. They took him up and brought him here. He neverspoke afterward. Within the week he died. You can see the color of hishair--faded, somewhat--by this thin shred that clings still to thetemple. This, [taking up a thigh bone,] was his. The veins of thisleaf in the decorations over your head, were his finger-joints, a hundredand fifty years ago."
This business-like way of illustrating a touching story of the heart bylaying the several fragments of the lover before us and naming them, wasas grotesque a performance, and as ghastly, as any I ever witnessed. Ihardly knew whether to smile or shudder. There are nerves and muscles inour frames whose functions and whose methods of working it seems a sortof sacrilege to describe by cold physiological names and surgicaltechnicalities, and the monk's talk suggested to me something of thiskind. Fancy a surgeon, with his nippers lifting tendons, muscles andsuch things into view, out of the complex machinery of a corpse, andobserving, "Now this little nerve quivers--the vibration is imparted tothis muscle--from here it is passed to this fibrous substance; here itsingredients are separated by the chemical action of the blood--one partgoes to the heart and thrills it with what is popularly termed emotion,another part follows this nerve to the brain and communicatesintelligence of a startling character--the third part glides along thispassage and touches the spring connected with the fluid receptacles thatlie in the rear of the eye. Thus, by this simple and beautiful process,the party is informed that his mother is dead, and he weeps." Horrible!
I asked the monk if all the brethren up stairs expected to be put in thisplace when they died. He answered quietly:
"We must all lie here at last."
See what one can accustom himself to.--The reflection that he must someday be taken apart like an engine or a clock, or like a house whose owneris gone, and worked up into arches and pyramids and hideous frescoes, didnot distress this monk in the least. I thought he even looked as if hewere thinking, with complacent vanity, that his own skull would look wellon top of the heap and his own ribs add a charm to the frescoes whichpossibly they lacked at present.
Here and there, in ornamental alcoves, stretched upon beds of bones, laydead and dried-up monks, with lank frames dressed in the black robes onesees ordinarily upon priests. We examined one closely. The skinny handswere clasped upon the breast; two lustreless tufts of hair stuck to theskull; the skin was brown and sunken; it stretched tightly over the cheekbones and made them stand out sharply; the crisp dead eyes were deep inthe sockets; the nostrils were painfully prominent, the end of the nosebeing gone; the lips had shriveled away from the yellow teeth: andbrought down to us through the circling years, and petrified there, was aweird laugh a full century old!
It was the jolliest laugh, but yet the most dreadful, that one canimagine. Surely, I thought, it must have been a most extraordinary jokethis veteran produced with his latest breath, that he has not got donelaughing at it yet. At this moment I saw that the old instinct wasstrong upon the boys, and I said we had better hurry to St. Peter's.They were trying to keep from asking, "Is--is he dead?"
It makes me dizzy, to think of the Vatican--of its wilderness of statues,paintings, and curiosities of every description and every age. The "oldmasters" (especially in sculpture,) fairly swarm, there. I can not writeabout the Vatican. I think I shall never remember any thing I saw theredistinctly but the mummies, and the Transfiguration, by Raphael, and someother things it is not necessary to mention now. I shall remember theTransfiguration partly because it was placed in a room almost by itself;partly because it is acknowledged by all to be the first oil painting inthe world; and partly because it was wonderfully beautiful. The colorsare fresh and rich, the "expression," I am told, is fine, the "feeling"is lively, the "tone" is good, the "depth" is profound, and the width isabout four and a half feet, I should judge. It is a picture that reallyholds one's attention; its beauty is fascinating. It is fine enough tobe a Renaissance. A remark I made a while ago suggests a thought--and ahope. Is it not possible that the reason I find such charms in thispicture is because it is out of the crazy chaos of the galleries? Ifsome of the others were set apart, might not they be beautiful? If thiswere set in the midst of the tempest of pictures one finds in the vastgalleries of the Roman palaces, would I think it so handsome? If, up tothis time, I had seen only one "old master" in each palace, instead ofacres and acres of walls and ceilings fairly papered with them, might Inot have a more civilized opinion of the old masters than I have now? Ithink so. When I was a school-boy and was to have a new knife, I couldnot make up my mind as to which was the prettiest in the show-case, and Idid not think any of them were particularly pretty; and so I chose with aheavy heart. But when I looked at my purchase, at home, where noglittering blades came into competition with it, I was astonished to seehow handsome it was. To this day my new hats look better out of the shopthan they did in it with other new hats. It begins to dawn upon me, now,that possibly, what I have been taking for uniform ugliness in thegalleries may be uniform beauty after all. I honestly hope it is, toothers, but certainly it is not to me. Perhaps the reason I used toenjoy going to the Academy of Fine Arts in New York was because therewere but a few hundred paintings in it, and it did not surfeit me to gothrough the list. I suppose the Academy was bacon and beans in theForty-Mile Desert, and a European gallery is a state dinner of thirteencourses. One leaves no sign after him of the one dish, but the thirteenfrighten away his appetite and give him no satisfaction.
There is one thing I am certain of, though. With all the MichaelAngelos, the Raphaels, the Guidos and the other old masters, the sublimehistory of Rome remains unpainted! They painted Virgins enough, andpopes enough and saintly scarecrows enough, to people Paradise, almost,and these things are all they did paint. "Nero fiddling o'er burningRome," the assassination of Caesar, the stirring spectacle of a hundredthousand people bending forward with rapt interest, in the coliseum, tosee two skillful gladiators hacking away each others' lives, a tigerspringing upon a kneeling martyr--these and a thousand other matterswhich we read of with a living interest, must be sought for only inbooks--not among the rubbish left by the old masters--who are no more, Ihave the satisfaction of informing the public.
They did paint, and they did carve in marble, one historical scene, andone only, (of any great historical consequence.) And what was it and whydid they choose it, particularly? It was the Rape of the Sabines, andthey chose it for the legs and busts.
I like to look at statues, however, and I like to look at pictures, also--even of monks looking up in sacred ecstacy, and monks looking down inmeditation, and monks skirmishing for something to eat--and therefore Idrop ill nature to thank the papal government for so jealously guardingand so industriously gathering up these things; and for permitting me, astranger and not an entirely friendly one, to roam at will and unmolestedamong them, charging me nothing, and only requiring that I shall behavemyself simply as well as I ought to behave in any other man's house. Ithank the Holy Father right heartily, and I wish him long life and plentyof happiness.
The Popes have long been the patrons and preservers of art, just as ournew, practical Republic is the encourager and upholder of mechanics. Intheir Vatican is stored up all that is curious and beautiful in art; inour Patent Office is hoarded all that is curious or useful in mechanics.When a man invents a new style of horse-collar or discovers a new andsuperior method of telegraphing, our government issues a patent to himthat is worth a fortune; when a man digs up an ancient statue in theCampagna, the Pope gives him a fortune in gold coin. We can makesomething of a guess at a man's character by the style of nose he carrieson his face. The Vatican and the Patent Office are governmental noses,and they bear a deal of character about them.
The guide showed us a colossal statue of Jupiter, in the Vatican, whichhe said looked so damaged and rusty--so like the God of the Vagabonds--because it had but recently been dug up in the Campagna. He asked howmuch we supposed this Jupiter was worth? I replied, with intelligentpromptness, that he was probably worth about four dollars--may be fourand a half. "A hundred thousand dollars!" Ferguson said. Fergusonsaid, further, that the Pope permits no ancient work of this kind toleave his dominions. He appoints a commission to examine discoverieslike this and report upon the value; then the Pope pays the discovererone-half of that assessed value and takes the statue. He said thisJupiter was dug from a field which had just been bought for thirty-sixthousand dollars, so the first crop was a good one for the new farmer.I do not know whether Ferguson always tells the truth or not, but Isuppose he does. I know that an exorbitant export duty is exacted uponall pictures painted by the old masters, in order to discourage the saleof those in the private collections. I am satisfied, also, that genuineold masters hardly exist at all, in America, because the cheapest andmost insignificant of them are valued at the price of a fine farm. Iproposed to buy a small trifle of a Raphael, myself, but the price of itwas eighty thousand dollars, the export duty would have made itconsiderably over a hundred, and so I studied on it awhile and concludednot to take it.
I wish here to mention an inscription I have seen, before I forget it:
"Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth TO MEN OF GOOD WILL!" It isnot good scripture, but it is sound Catholic and human nature.
This is in letters of gold around the apsis of a mosaic group at the sideof the 'scala santa', church of St. John Lateran, the Mother and Mistressof all the Catholic churches of the world. The group represents theSaviour, St. Peter, Pope Leo, St. Silvester, Constantine and Charlemagne.Peter is giving the pallium to the Pope, and a standard to Charlemagne.The Saviour is giving the keys to St. Silvester, and a standard toConstantine. No prayer is offered to the Saviour, who seems to be oflittle importance any where in Rome; but an inscription below says,"Blessed Peter, give life to Pope Leo and victory to king Charles." Itdoes not say, "Intercede for us, through the Saviour, with the Father,for this boon," but "Blessed Peter, give it us."
In all seriousness--without meaning to be frivolous--without meaning tobe irreverent, and more than all, without meaning to be blasphemous,--Istate as my simple deduction from the things I have seen and the things Ihave heard, that the Holy Personages rank thus in Rome:
First--"The Mother of God"--otherwise the Virgin Mary.
Second--The Deity.
Third--Peter.
Fourth--Some twelve or fifteen canonized Popes and martyrs.
Fifth--Jesus Christ the Saviour--(but always as an infant in arms.)
I may be wrong in this--my judgment errs often, just as is the case withother men's--but it is my judgment, be it good or bad.
Just here I will mention something that seems curious to me. There areno "Christ's Churches" in Rome, and no "Churches of the Holy Ghost," thatI can discover. There are some four hundred churches, but about a fourthof them seem to be named for the Madonna and St. Peter. There are somany named for Mary that they have to be distinguished by all sorts ofaffixes, if I understand the matter rightly. Then we have churches ofSt. Louis; St. Augustine; St. Agnes; St. Calixtus; St. Lorenzo in Lucina;St. Lorenzo in Damaso; St. Cecilia; St. Athanasius; St. Philip Neri; St.Catherine, St. Dominico, and a multitude of lesser saints whose names arenot familiar in the world--and away down, clear out of the list of thechurches, comes a couple of hospitals: one of them is named for theSaviour and the other for the Holy Ghost!
Day after day and night after night we have wandered among the crumblingwonders of Rome; day after day and night after night we have fed upon thedust and decay of five-and-twenty centuries--have brooded over them byday and dreampt of them by night till sometimes we seemed moldering awayourselves, and growing defaced and cornerless, and liable at any momentto fall a prey to some antiquary and be patched in the legs, and"restored" with an unseemly nose, and labeled wrong and dated wrong, andset up in the Vatican for poets to drivel about and vandals to scribbletheir names on forever and forevermore.
But the surest way to stop writing about Rome is to stop. I wished towrite a real "guide-book" chapter on this fascinating city, but I couldnot do it, because I have felt all the time like a boy in a candy-shop--there was every thing to choose from, and yet no choice. I have driftedalong hopelessly for a hundred pages of manuscript without knowing whereto commence. I will not commence at all. Our passports have beenexamined. We will go to Naples.
