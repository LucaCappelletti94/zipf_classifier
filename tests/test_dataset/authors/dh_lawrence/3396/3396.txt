From Amores, (1916).
  The five old bells	Are hurrying and eagerly calling,	Imploring, protesting	They know, but clamorously falling	Into gabbling incoherence, never resting, Like spattering showers from a bursten sky-rocket dropping	In splashes of sound, endlessly, never stopping.	 The silver moon	That somebody has spun so high	To settle the question, yes or no, has caught In the net of the night's balloon,	And sits with a smooth bland smile up there in the sky	Smiling at naught,	Unless the winking star that keeps her company	Makes little jests at the bells' insanity, As if he knew aught!	 The patient Night	Sits indifferent, hugged in her rags,	She neither knows nor cares Why the old church sobs and brags; The light distresses her eyes, and tears	Her old blue cloak, as she crouches and covers her face,	Smiling, perhaps, if we knew it, at the bells' loud clattering disgrace.	 The wise old trees	Drop their leaves with a faint, sharp hiss of contempt, While a car at the end of the street goes by with a laugh;	As by degrees	The poor bells cease, and the Night is exempt,	And the stars can chaff	The ironic moon at their ease, while the dim old church Is peopled with shadows and sounds and ghosts that lurch	In its cenotaph.
