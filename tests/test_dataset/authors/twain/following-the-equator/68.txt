None of us can have as many virtues as the fountain-pen, or half itscussedness; but we can try. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The Duke of Fife has borne testimony that Mr. Rhodes deceived him. Thatis also what Mr. Rhodes did with the Reformers. He got them intotrouble, and then stayed out himself. A judicious man. He has alwaysbeen that. As to this there was a moment of doubt, once. It was when hewas out on his last pirating expedition in the Matabele country. Thecable shouted out that he had gone unarmed, to visit a party of hostilechiefs. It was true, too; and this dare-devil thing came near fetchinganother indiscretion out of the poet laureate. It would have been toobad, for when the facts were all in, it turned out that there was a ladyalong, too, and she also was unarmed.
In the opinion of many people Mr. Rhodes is South Africa; others think heis only a large part of it. These latter consider that South Africaconsists of Table Mountain, the diamond mines, the Johannesburg goldfields, and Cecil Rhodes. The gold fields are wonderful in every way.In seven or eight years they built up, in a desert, a city of a hundredthousand inhabitants, counting white and black together; and not theordinary mining city of wooden shanties, but a city made out of lastingmaterial. Nowhere in the world is there such a concentration of richmines as at Johannesburg. Mr. Bonamici, my manager there, gave me asmall gold brick with some statistics engraved upon it which record theoutput of gold from the early days to July, 1895, and exhibit the strideswhich have been made in the development of the industry; in 1888 theoutput was $4,162,440; the output of the next five and a half years was(total: $17,585,894); for the single year ending with June, 1895, it was$45,553,700.
The capital which has developed the mines came from England, the miningengineers from America. This is the case with the diamond mines also.South Africa seems to be the heaven of the American scientific miningengineer. He gets the choicest places, and keeps them. His salary isnot based upon what he would get in America, but apparently upon what awhole family of him would get there.
The successful mines pay great dividends, yet the rock is not rich, froma Californian point of view. Rock which yields ten or twelve dollars aton is considered plenty rich enough. It is troubled with base metals tosuch a degree that twenty years ago it would have been only about half asvaluable as it is now; for at that time there was no paying way ofgetting anything out of such rock but the coarser-grained "free" gold; butthe new cyanide process has changed all that, and the gold fields of theworld now deliver up fifty million dollars' worth of gold per year whichwould have gone into the tailing-pile under the former conditions.
The cyanide process was new to me, and full of interest; and among thecostly and elaborate mining machinery there were fine things which werenew to me, but I was already familiar with the rest of the details of thegold-mining industry. I had been a gold miner myself, in my day, andknew substantially everything that those people knew about it, except howto make money at it. But I learned a good deal about the Boers there,and that was a fresh subject. What I heard there was afterwards repeatedto me in other parts of South Africa. Summed up--according to theinformation thus gained--this is the Boer:
He is deeply religious, profoundly ignorant, dull, obstinate, bigoted,uncleanly in his habits, hospitable, honest in his dealings with thewhites, a hard master to his black servant, lazy, a good shot, goodhorseman, addicted to the chase, a lover of political independence, agood husband and father, not fond of herding together in towns, butliking the seclusion and remoteness and solitude and empty vastness andsilence of the veldt; a man of a mighty appetite, and not delicate aboutwhat he appeases it with--well-satisfied with pork and Indian corn andbiltong, requiring only that the quantity shall not be stinted; willingto ride a long journey to take a hand in a rude all-night danceinterspersed with vigorous feeding and boisterous jollity, but ready toride twice as far for a prayer-meeting; proud of his Dutch and Huguenotorigin and its religious and military history; proud of his race'sachievements in South Africa, its bold plunges into hostile and uncharteddeserts in search of free solitudes unvexed by the pestering and detestedEnglish, also its victories over the natives and the British; proudest ofall, of the direct and effusive personal interest which the Deity hasalways taken in its affairs. He cannot read, he cannot write; he has oneor two newspapers, but he is, apparently, not aware of it; until latterlyhe had no schools, and taught his children nothing, news is a term whichhas no meaning to him, and the thing itself he cares nothing about. Hehates to be taxed and resents it. He has stood stock still in SouthAfrica for two centuries and a half, and would like to stand still tillthe end of time, for he has no sympathy with Uitlander notions ofprogress. He is hungry to be rich, for he is human; but his preferencehas been for riches in cattle, not in fine clothes and fine houses andgold and diamonds. The gold and the diamonds have brought the godlessstranger within his gates, also contamination and broken repose, and hewishes that they had never been discovered.
I think that the bulk of those details can be found in Olive Schreiner'sbooks, and she would not be accused of sketching the Boer's portrait withan unfair hand.
Now what would you expect from that unpromising material? What ought youto expect from it? Laws inimical to religious liberty? Yes. Lawsdenying, representation and suffrage to the intruder? Yes. Lawsunfriendly to educational institutions? Yes. Laws obstructive of goldproduction? Yes. Discouragement of railway expansion? Yes. Laws heavilytaxing the intruder and overlooking the Boer? Yes.
The Uitlander seems to have expected something very different from allthat. I do not know why. Nothing different from it was rationally to beexpected. A round man cannot be expected to fit a square hole rightaway. He must have time to modify his shape. The modification had begunin a detail or two, before the Raid, and was making some progress. Ithas made further progress since. There are wise men in the Boergovernment, and that accounts for the modification; the modification ofthe Boer mass has probably not begun yet. If the heads of the Boergovernment had not been wise men they would have hanged Jameson, and thusturned a very commonplace pirate into a holy martyr. But even theirwisdom has its limits, and they will hang Mr. Rhodes if they ever catchhim. That will round him and complete him and make him a saint. He hasalready been called by all other titles that symbolize human grandeur,and he ought to rise to this one, the grandest of all. It will be adizzy jump from where he is now, but that is nothing, it will land him ingood company and be a pleasant change for him.
Some of the things demanded by the Johannesburgers' Manifesto have beenconceded since the days of the Raid, and the others will follow in time,no doubt. It was most fortunate for the miners of Johannesburg that thetaxes which distressed them so much were levied by the Boer government,instead of by their friend Rhodes and his Chartered Company ofhighwaymen, for these latter take half of whatever their mining victimsfind, they do not stop at a mere percentage. If the Johannesburg minerswere under their jurisdiction they would be in the poorhouse in twelvemonths.
I have been under the impression all along that I had an unpleasantparagraph about the Boers somewhere in my notebook, and also a pleasantone. I have found them now. The unpleasant one is dated at an interiorvillage, and says--
"Mr. Z. called. He is an English Afrikander; is an old resident, and hasa Boer wife. He speaks the language, and his professional business iswith the Boers exclusively. He told me that the ancient Boer families inthe great region of which this village is the commercial center arefalling victims to their inherited indolence and dullness in thematerialistic latter-day race and struggle, and are dropping one by oneinto the grip of the usurer--getting hopelessly in debt--and are losingtheir high place and retiring to second and lower. The Boer's farm doesnot go to another Boer when he loses it, but to a foreigner. Some havefallen so low that they sell their daughters to the blacks."
Under date of another South African town I find the note which iscreditable to the Boers:
"Dr. X. told me that in the Kafir war 1,500 Kafirs took refuge in a greatcave in the mountains about 90 miles north of Johannesburg, and the Boersblocked up the entrance and smoked them to death. Dr. X. has been inthere and seen the great array of bleached skeletons--one a woman withthe skeleton of a child hugged to her breast."
The great bulk of the savages must go. The white man wants their lands,and all must go excepting such percentage of them as he will need to dohis work for him upon terms to be determined by himself. Since historyhas removed the element of guesswork from this matter and made itcertainty, the humanest way of diminishing the black population should beadopted, not the old cruel ways of the past. Mr. Rhodes and his ganghave been following the old ways.--They are chartered to rob and slay,and they lawfully do it, but not in a compassionate and Christian spirit.They rob the Mashonas and the Matabeles of a portion of their territoriesin the hallowed old style of "purchase!" for a song, and then they forcea quarrel and take the rest by the strong hand. They rob the natives oftheir cattle under the pretext that all the cattle in the countrybelonged to the king whom they have tricked and assassinated. They issue"regulations" requiring the incensed and harassed natives to work for thewhite settlers, and neglect their own affairs to do it. This is slavery,and is several times worse than was the American slavery which used topain England so much; for when this Rhodesian slave is sick,super-annuated, or otherwise disabled, he must support himselfor starve--his master is under no obligation to support him.
The reduction of the population by Rhodesian methods to the desired limitis a return to the old-time slow-misery and lingering-death system of adiscredited time and a crude "civilization." We humanely reduce anoverplus of dogs by swift chloroform; the Boer humanely reduced anoverplus of blacks by swift suffocation; the nameless but right-heartedAustralian pioneer humanely reduced his overplus of aboriginal neighborsby a sweetened swift death concealed in a poisoned pudding. All theseare admirable, and worthy of praise; you and I would rather suffer eitherof these deaths thirty times over in thirty successive days than lingerout one of the Rhodesian twenty-year deaths, with its daily burden ofinsult, humiliation, and forced labor for a man whose entire race thevictim hates. Rhodesia is a happy name for that land of piracy andpillage, and puts the right stain upon it.
Several long journeys--gave us experience of the Cape Colony railways;easy-riding, fine cars; all the conveniences; thorough cleanliness;comfortable beds furnished for the night trains. It was in the firstdays of June, and winter; the daytime was pleasant, the nighttime niceand cold. Spinning along all day in the cars it was ecstasy to breathethe bracing air and gaze out over the vast brown solitudes of the velvetplains, soft and lovely near by, still softer and lovelier further away,softest and loveliest of all in the remote distances, where dimisland-hills seemed afloat, as in a sea--a sea made of dream-stuff andflushed with colors faint and rich; and dear me, the depth of the sky,and the beauty of the strange new cloud-forms, and the glory of thesunshine, the lavishness, the wastefulness of it! The vigor andfreshness and inspiration of the air and the sunwell, it was alljust as Olive Schreiner had made it in her books.
To me the veldt, in its sober winter garb, was surpassingly beautiful.There were unlevel stretches where it was rolling and swelling, andrising and subsiding, and sweeping superbly on and on, and still on andon like an ocean, toward the faraway horizon, its pale brown deepening bydelicately graduated shades to rich orange, and finally to purple andcrimson where it washed against the wooded hills and naked red crags atthe base of the sky.
Everywhere, from Cape Town to Kimberley and from Kimberley to PortElizabeth and East London, the towns were well populated with tamedblacks; tamed and Christianized too, I suppose, for they wore the dowdyclothes of our Christian civilization. But for that, many of them wouldhave been remarkably handsome. These fiendish clothes, together with theproper lounging gait, good-natured face, happy air, and easy laugh, madethem precise counterparts of our American blacks; often where all theother aspects were strikingly and harmoniously and thrillingly African, aflock of these natives would intrude, looking wholly out of place, andspoil it all, making the thing a grating discord, half African and halfAmerican.
One Sunday in King William's Town a score of colored women came mincingacross the great barren square dressed--oh, in the last perfection offashion, and newness, and expensiveness, and showy mixture of unrelatedcolors,--all just as I had seen it so often at home; and in their facesand their gait was that languishing, aristocratic, divine delight intheir finery which was so familiar to me, and had always been such asatisfaction to my eye and my heart. I seemed among old, old friends;friends of fifty years, and I stopped and cordially greeted them. Theybroke into a good-fellowship laugh, flashing their white teeth upon me,and all answered at once. I did not understand a word they said. I wasastonished; I was not dreaming that they would answer in anything butAmerican.
The voices, too, of the African women, were familiar to me sweet andmusical, just like those of the slave women of my early days. I followeda couple of them all over the Orange Free State--no, over its capital--Bloemfontein, to hear their liquid voices and the happy ripple of theirlaughter. Their language was a large improvement upon American. Alsoupon the Zulu. It had no Zulu clicks in it; and it seemed to have noangles or corners, no roughness, no vile s's or other hissing sounds, butwas very, very mellow and rounded and flowing.
In moving about the country in the trains, I had opportunity to see agood many Boers of the veldt. One day at a village station a hundred ofthem got out of the third-class cars to feed.
Their clothes were very interesting. For ugliness of shapes, and formiracles of ugly colors inharmoniously associated, they were a record.The effect was nearly as exciting and interesting as that produced by thebrilliant and beautiful clothes and perfect taste always on view at theIndian railway stations. One man had corduroy trousers of a fadedchewing gum tint. And they were new--showing that this tint did not comeby calamity, but was intentional; the very ugliest color I have everseen. A gaunt, shackly country lout six feet high, in battered grayslouched hat with wide brim, and old resin-colored breeches, had on ahideous brand-new woolen coat which was imitation tiger skin wavy broadstripes of dazzling yellow and deep brown. I thought he ought to behanged, and asked the station-master if it could be arranged. He saidno; and not only that, but said it rudely; said it with a quiteunnecessary show of feeling. Then he muttered something about my being ajackass, and walked away and pointed me out to people, and did everythinghe could to turn public sentiment against me. It is what one gets fortrying to do good.
In the train that day a passenger told me some more about Boer life outin the lonely veldt. He said the Boer gets up early and sets his"niggers" at their tasks (pasturing the cattle, and watching them); eats,smokes, drowses, sleeps; toward evening superintends the milking, etc.;eats, smokes, drowses; goes to bed at early candlelight in the fragrantclothes he (and she) have worn all day and every week-day for years. Iremember that last detail, in Olive Schreiner's "Story of an AfricanFarm." And the passenger told me that the Boers were justly noted fortheir hospitality. He told me a story about it. He said that his gracethe Bishop of a certain See was once making a business-progress throughthe tavernless veldt, and one night he stopped with a Boer; after supperwas shown to bed; he undressed, weary and worn out, and was soon soundasleep; in the night he woke up feeling crowded and suffocated, and foundthe old Boer and his fat wife in bed with him, one on each side, with alltheir clothes on, and snoring. He had to stay there and stand it--awakeand suffering--until toward dawn, when sleep again fell upon him for anhour. Then he woke again. The Boer was gone, but the wife was still athis side.
Those Reformers detested that Boer prison; they were not used to crampedquarters and tedious hours, and weary idleness, and early to bed, andlimited movement, and arbitrary and irritating rules, and the absence ofthe luxuries which wealth comforts the day and the night with. Theconfinement told upon their bodies and their spirits; still, they weresuperior men, and they made the best that was to be made of thecircumstances. Their wives smuggled delicacies to them, which helped tosmooth the way down for the prison fare.
In the train Mr. B. told me that the Boer jail-guards treated the blackprisoners--even political ones--mercilessly. An African chief and hisfollowing had been kept there nine months without trial, and during allthat time they had been without shelter from rain and sun. He said thatone day the guards put a big black in the stocks for dashing his soup onthe ground; they stretched his legs painfully wide apart, and set himwith his back down hill; he could not endure it, and put back his handsupon the slope for a support. The guard ordered him to withdraw thesupport and kicked him in the back. "Then," said Mr. B., "'the powerfulblack wrenched the stocks asunder and went for the guard; a Reformprisoner pulled him off, and thrashed the guard himself."
