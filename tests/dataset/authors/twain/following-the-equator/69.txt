Next to Mr. Rhodes, to me the most interesting convulsion of nature inSouth Africa was the diamond-crater. The Rand gold fields are astupendous marvel, and they make all other gold fields small, but I wasnot a stranger to gold-mining; the veldt was a noble thing to see, but itwas only another and lovelier variety of our Great Plains; the nativeswere very far from being uninteresting, but they were not new; and as forthe towns, I could find my way without a guide through the most of thembecause I had learned the streets, under other names, in towns just likethem in other lands; but the diamond mine was a wholly fresh thing, asplendid and absorbing novelty. Very few people in the world have seenthe diamond in its home. It has but three or four homes in the world,whereas gold has a million. It is worth while to journey around theglobe to see anything which can truthfully be called a novelty, and thediamond mine is the greatest and most select and restricted novelty whichthe globe has in stock.
The Kimberley diamond deposits were discovered about 1869, I think. Wheneverything is taken into consideration, the wonder is that they were notdiscovered five thousand years ago and made familiar to the African worldfor the rest of time. For this reason the first diamonds were found onthe surface of the ground. They were smooth and limpid, and in thesunlight they vomited fire. They were the very things which an Africansavage of any era would value above every other thing in the worldexcepting a glass bead. For two or three centuries we have been buyinghis lands, his cattle, his neighbor, and any other thing he had for sale,for glass beads and so it is strange that he was indifferent to thediamonds--for he must have pickets them up many and many a time. Itwould not occur to him to try to sell them to whites, of course, sincethe whites already had plenty of glass beads, and more fashionablyshaped, too, than these; but one would think that the poorer sort ofblack, who could not afford real glass, would have been humbly content todecorate himself with the imitation, and that presently the white traderwould notice the things, and dimly suspect, and carry some of them home,and find out what they were, and at once empty a multitude offortune-hunters into Africa. There are many strange things in humanhistory; one of the strangest is that the sparkling diamonds laid thereso long without exciting any one's interest.
The revelation came at last by accident. In a Boer's hut out in the widesolitude of the plains, a traveling stranger noticed a child playing witha bright object, and was told it was a piece of glass which had beenfound in the veldt. The stranger bought it for a trifle and carried itaway; and being without honor, made another stranger believe it was adiamond, and so got $125 out of him for it, and was as pleased withhimself as if he had done a righteous thing. In Paris the wrongedstranger sold it to a pawnshop for $10,000, who sold it to a countess for$90,000, who sold it to a brewer for $800;000, who traded it to a kingfor a dukedom and a pedigree, and the king "put it up the spout."--[handwritten note: "From the Greek meaning 'pawned it.'" M.T.]--I knowthese particulars to be correct.
The news flew around, and the South African diamond-boom began. Theoriginal traveler--the dishonest one--now remembered that he had onceseen a Boer teamster chocking his wagon-wheel on a steep grade with adiamond as large as a football, and he laid aside his occupations andstarted out to hunt for it, but not with the intention of cheatinganybody out of $125 with it, for he had reformed.
We now come to matters more didactic. Diamonds are not imbedded in rockledges fifty miles long, like the Johannesburg gold, but are distributedthrough the rubbish of a filled-up well, so to speak. The well is rich,its walls are sharply defined; outside of the walls are no diamonds. Thewell is a crater, and a large one. Before it had been meddled with, itssurface was even with the level plain, and there was no sign to suggestthat it was there. The pasturage covering the surface of the Kimberleycrater was sufficient for the support of a cow, and the pasturageunderneath was sufficient for the support of a kingdom; but the cow didnot know it, and lost her chance.
The Kimberley crater is roomy enough to admit the Roman Coliseum; thebottom of the crater has not been reached, and no one can tell how fardown in the bowels of the earth it goes. Originally, it was aperpendicular hole packed solidly full of blue rock or cement, andscattered through that blue mass, like raisins in a pudding, were thediamonds. As deep down in the earth as the blue stuff extends, so deepwill the diamonds be found.
There are three or four other celebrated craters near by a circle threemiles in diameter would enclose them all. They are owned by the De BeersCompany, a consolidation of diamond properties arranged by Mr. Rhodestwelve or fourteen years ago. The De Beers owns other craters; they areunder the grass, but the De Beers knows where they are, and will openthem some day, if the market should require it.
Originally, the diamond deposits were the property of the Orange FreeState; but a judicious "rectification" of the boundary line shifted themover into the British territory of Cape Colony. A high official of theFree State told me that the sum of $4,00,000 was handed to hiscommonwealth as a compromise, or indemnity, or something of the sort, andthat he thought his commonwealth did wisely to take the money and keepout of a dispute, since the power was all on the one side and theweakness all on the other. The De Beers Company dig out $400,000 worthof diamonds per week, now. The Cape got the territory, but no profit;for Mr. Rhodes and the Rothschilds and the other De Beers people own themines, and they pay no taxes.
In our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles, under theguidance of the ablest mining-engineering talent procurable in America.There are elaborate works for reducing the blue rock and passing itthrough one process after another until every diamond it contains hasbeen hunted down and secured. I watched the "concentrators" at work bigtanks containing mud and water and invisible diamonds--and was told thateach could stir and churn and properly treat 300 car-loads of mud per day1,600 pounds to the car-load--and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush. Isaw the 3 carloads of slush taken to the "pulsators" and there reduced toquarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand. Then I followed it tothe sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out andbrush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up. I assisted, andonce I found a diamond half as large as an almond. It is an excitingkind of fishing, and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time youdetect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of darksand. I would like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sportevery now and then. Of course there are disappointments. Sometimes youfind a diamond which is not a diamond; it is only a quartz crystal orsome such worthless thing. The expert can generally distinguish it fromthe precious stone which it is counterfeiting; but if he is in doubt helays it on a flatiron and hits it with a sledgehammer. If it is adiamond it holds its own; if it is anything else, it is reduced topowder. I liked that experiment very much, and did not tire ofrepetitions of it. It was full of enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred byany personal sense of risk. The De Beers concern treats 8;000 carloads--about 6,000 tons--of blue rock per day, and the result is three pounds ofdiamonds. Value, uncut, $50,000 to $70,000. After cutting, they willweigh considerably less than a pound, but will be worth four or fivetimes as much as they were before.
All the plain around that region is spread over, a foot deep, with bluerock, placed there by the Company, and looks like a plowed field.Exposure for a length of time make the rock easier to work than it iswhen it comes out of the mine. If mining should cease now, the supply ofrock spread over those fields would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads perday to the separating works during three years. The fields are fencedand watched; and at night they are under the constant inspection of loftyelectric searchlight. They contain fifty or sixty million dollars'worth' of diamonds, and there is an abundance of enterprising thievesaround.
In the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden wealth. Sometime ago the people were granted the privilege of a free wash-up. Therewas a general rush, the work was done with thoroughness, and a goodharvest of diamonds was gathered.
The deep mining is done by natives. There are many hundreds of them.They live in quarters built around the inside of a great compound. Theyare a jolly and good-natured lot, and accommodating. They performed awar-dance for us, which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen.They are not allowed outside of the compound during their term of servicethree months, I think it, is, as a rule. They go down the shaft, standtheir watch, come up again, are searched, and go to bed or to theiramusements in the compound; and this routine they repeat, day in and dayout.
It is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds successfully.They used to swallow them, and find other ways of concealing them, butthe white man found ways of beating their various games. One man cut hisleg and shoved a diamond into the wound, but even that project did notsucceed. When they find a fine large diamond they are more likely toreport it than to steal it, for in the former case they get a reward, andin the latter they are quite apt to merely get into trouble. Some yearsago, in a mine not owned by the De Beers, a black found what has beenclaimed to be the largest diamond known to the world's history; and, as areward he was released from service and given a blanket, a horse, andfive hundred dollars. It made him a Vanderbilt. He could buy fourwives, and have money left. Four wives are an ample support for anative. With four wives he is wholly independent, and need never do astroke of work again.
That great diamond weighs 97l carats. Some say it is as big as a pieceof alum, others say it is as large as a bite of rock candy, but the bestauthorities agree that it is almost exactly the size of a chunk of ice.But those details are not important; and in my opinion not trustworthy.It has a flaw in it, otherwise it would be of incredible value. As itis, it is held to be worth $2,000,000. After cutting it ought to beworth from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000, therefore persons desiring to savemoney should buy it now. It is owned by a syndicate, and apparentlythere is no satisfactory market for it. It is earning nothing; it iseating its head off. Up to this time it has made nobody rich but thenative who found it.
He found it in a mine which was being worked by contract. That is tosay, a company had bought the privilege of taking from the mine 5,000,000carloads of blue-rock, for a sum down and a royalty. Their speculationhad not paid; but on the very day that their privilege ran out thatnative found the $2,000,000-diamond and handed it over to them. Even thediamond culture is not without its romantic episodes.
The Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond, and valuable; but it cannot compete inthese matters with three which--according to legend--are among the crowntrinkets of Portugal and Russia. One of these is held to be worth$20,000,000; another, $25,000,000, and the third something over$28,000,000.
Those are truly wonderful diamonds, whether they exist or not; and yetthey are of but little importance by comparison with the one wherewiththe Boer wagoner chocked his wheel on that steep grade as heretoforereferred to. In Kimberley I had some conversation with the man who sawthe Boer do that--an incident which had occurred twenty-seven ortwenty-eight years before I had my talk with him. He assured me thatthat diamond's value could have been over a billion dollars, but notunder it. I believed him, because he had devoted twenty-seven years tohunting for it, and was, in a position to know.
A fitting and interesting finish to an examination of the tedious andlaborious and costly processes whereby the diamonds are gotten out of thedeeps of the earth and freed from the base stuffs which imprison them isthe visit to the De Beers offices in the town of Kimberley, where theresult of each day's mining is brought every day, and, weighed, assorted,valued, and deposited in safes against shipping-day. An unknown andunaccredited person cannot, get into that place; and it seemed apparentfrom the generous supply of warning and protective and prohibitory signsthat were posted all about, that not even the known and accredited cansteal diamonds there without inconvenience.
We saw the day's output--shining little nests of diamonds, distributed afoot apart, along a counter, each nest reposing upon a sheet of whitepaper. That day's catch was about $70,000 worth. In the course of ayear half a ton of diamonds pass under the scales there and sleep on thatcounter; the resulting money is $18,000,000 or $20,000,000. Profit,about $12,000,000.
Young girls were doing the sorting--a nice, clean, dainty, and probablydistressing employment. Every day ducal incomes sift and sparkle throughthe fingers of those young girls; yet they go to bed at night as poor asthey were when they got up in the morning. The same thing next day, andall the days.
They are beautiful things, those diamonds, in their native state. Theyare of various shapes; they have flat surfaces, rounded borders, andnever a sharp edge. They are of all colors and shades of color, fromdewdrop white to actual black; and their smooth and rounded surfaces andcontours, variety of color, and transparent limpidity make them look likepiles of assorted candies. A very light straw color is their commonesttint. It seemed to me that these uncut gems must be more beautiful thanany cut ones could be; but when a collection of cut ones was brought out,I saw my mistake. Nothing is so beautiful as a rose diamond with thelight playing through it, except that uncostly thing which is just likeit--wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through it and striking awhite-sand bottom.
Before the middle of July we reached Cape Town, and the end of ourAfrican journeyings. And well satisfied; for, towering above us wasTable Mountain--a reminder that we had now seen each and all of the greatfeatures of South Africa except Mr. Cecil Rhodes. I realize that that isa large exception. I know quite well that whether Mr. Rhodes is thelofty and worshipful patriot and statesman that multitudes believe him tobe, or Satan come again, as the rest of the world account him, he isstill the most imposing figure in the British empire outside of England.When he stands on the Cape of Good Hope, his shadow falls to the Zambesi.He is the only colonial in the British dominions whose goings and comingsare chronicled and discussed under all the globe's meridians, and whosespeeches, unclipped, are cabled from the ends of the earth; and he is theonly unroyal outsider whose arrival in London can compete for attentionwith an eclipse.
That he is an extraordinary man, and not an accident of fortune, not evenhis dearest South African enemies were willing to deny, so far as I heardthem testify. The whole South African world seemed to stand in a kind ofshuddering awe of him, friend and enemy alike. It was as if he weredeputy-God on the one side, deputy-Satan on the other, proprietor of thepeople, able to make them or ruin them by his breath, worshiped by many,hated by many, but blasphemed by none among the judicious, and even bythe indiscreet in guarded whispers only.
What is the secret of his formidable supremacy? One says it is hisprodigious wealth--a wealth whose drippings in salaries and in other wayssupport multitudes and make them his interested and loyal vassals;another says it is his personal magnetism and his persuasive tongue, andthat these hypnotize and make happy slaves of all that drift within thecircle of their influence; another says it is his majestic ideas, hisvast schemes for the territorial aggrandizement of England, his patrioticand unselfish ambition to spread her beneficent protection and her justrule over the pagan wastes of Africa and make luminous the Africandarkness with the glory of her name; and another says he wants the earthand wants it for his own, and that the belief that he will get it and lethis friends in on the ground floor is the secret that rivets so many eyesupon him and keeps him in the zenith where the view is unobstructed.
One may take his choice. They are all the same price. One fact is sure:he keeps his prominence and a vast following, no matter what he does. He"deceives" the Duke of Fife--it is the Duke's word--but that does notdestroy the Duke's loyalty to him. He tricks the Reformers into immensetrouble with his Raid, but the most of them believe he meant well. Heweeps over the harshly--taxed Johannesburgers and makes them his friends;at the same time he taxes his Charter-settlers 50 per cent., and so winstheir affection and their confidence that they are squelched with despairat every rumor that the Charter is to be annulled. He raids and robs andslays and enslaves the Matabele and gets worlds of Charter-Christianapplause for it. He has beguiled England into buying Charter waste paperfor Bank of England notes, ton for ton, and the ravished still burnincense to him as the Eventual God of Plenty. He has done everything hecould think of to pull himself down to the ground; he has done more thanenough to pull sixteen common-run great men down; yet there he stands, tothis day, upon his dizzy summit under the dome of the sky, an apparentpermanency, the marvel of the time, the mystery of the age, an Archangelwith wings to half the world, Satan with a tail to the other half.
I admire him, I frankly confess it; and when his time comes I shall buy apiece of the rope for a keepsake.
