We Pierce the Last Ambuscades
WE RESTED and otherwise refreshed ourselves two or three hours at Gien,but by that time the news was abroad that the young girl commissioned ofGod to deliver France was come; wherefore, such a press of people flockedto our quarters to get sight of her that it seemed best to seek a quieterplace; so we pushed on and halted at a small village called Fierbois.
We were now within six leagues of the King, who was a the Castle ofChinon. Joan dictated a letter to him at once, and I wrote it. In it shesaid she had come a hundred and fifty leagues to bring him good news, andbegged the privilege of delivering it in person. She added that althoughshe had never seen him she would know him in any disguise and would pointhim out.
The two knights rode away at once with the letter. The troop slept allthe afternoon, and after supper we felt pretty fresh and fine, especiallyour little group of young Domremians. We had the comfortable tap-room ofthe village inn to ourselves, and for the first time in ten unspeakablylong days were exempt from bodings and terrors and hardships andfatiguing labors. The Paladin was suddenly become his ancient self again,and was swaggering up and down, a very monument of self-complacency. NoelRainguesson said:
"I think it is wonderful, the way he has brought us through."
"Who?" asked Jean.
"Why, the Paladin."
The Paladin seemed not to hear.
"What had he to do with it?" asked Pierre d'Arc.
"Everything. It was nothing but Joan's confidence in his discretion thatenabled her to keep up her heart. She could depend on us and on herselffor valor, but discretion is the winning thing in war, after all;discretion is the rarest and loftiest of qualities, and he has got moreof it than any other man in France--more of it, perhaps, than any othersixty men in France."
"Now you are getting ready to make a fool of yourself, Noel Rainguesson,"said the Paladin, "and you want to coil some of that long tongue of yoursaround your neck and stick the end of it in your ear, then you'll be theless likely to get into trouble."
"I didn't know he had more discretion than other people," said Pierre,"for discretion argues brains, and he hasn't any more brains than therest of us, in my opinion."
"No, you are wrong there. Discretion hasn't anything to do with brains;brains are an obstruction to it, for it does not reason, it feels.Perfect discretion means absence of brains. Discretion is a quality ofthe heart--solely a quality of the heart; it acts upon us throughfeeling. We know this because if it were an intellectual quality it wouldonly perceive a danger, for instance, where a danger exists; whereas--"
"Hear him twaddle--the damned idiot!" muttered the Paladin.
"--whereas, it being purely a quality of the heart, and proceeding byfeeling, not reason, its reach is correspondingly wider and sublimer,enabling it to perceive and avoid dangers that haven't any existence atall; as, for instance, that night in the fog, when the Paladin took hishorse's ears for hostile lances and got off and climbed a tree--"
"It's a lie! a lie without shadow of foundation, and I call upon you allto beware you give credence to the malicious inventions of thisramshackle slander-mill that has been doing its best to destroy mycharacter for years, and will grind up your own reputations for you next.I got off to tighten my saddle-girth--I wish I may die in my tracks if itisn't so--and whoever wants to believe it can, and whoever don't can letit alone."
"There, that is the way with him, you see; he never can discuss a themetemperately, but always flies off the handle and becomes disagreeable.And you notice his defect of memory. He remembers getting off his horse,but forgets all the rest, even the tree. But that is natural; he wouldremember getting off the horse because he was so used to doing it. Healways did it when there was an alarm and the clash of arms at thefront."
"Why did he choose that time for it?" asked Jean.
"I don't know. To tighten up his girth, he thinks, to climb a tree, Ithink; I saw him climb nine trees in a single night."
"You saw nothing of the kind! A person that can lie like that deserves noone's respect. I ask you all to answer me. Do you believe what thisreptile has said?"
All seemed embarrassed, and only Pierre replied. He said, hesitatingly:
"I--well, I hardly know what to say. It is a delicate situation. It seemsoffensive to me to refuse to believe a person when he makes so direct astatement, and yet I am obliged to say, rude as it may appear, that I amnot able to believe the whole of it--no, I am not able to believe thatyou climbed nine trees."
"There!" cried the Paladin; "now what do you think of yourself, NoelRainguesson? How many do you believe I climbed, Pierre?"
"Only eight."
The laughter that followed inflamed the Paladin's anger to white heat,and he said:
"I bide my time--I bide my time. I will reckon with you all, I promiseyou that!"
"Don't get him started," Noel pleaded; "he is a perfect lion when he getsstarted. I saw enough to teach me that, after the third skirmish. Afterit was over I saw him come out of the bushes and attack a dead mansingle-handed."
"It is another lie; and I give you fair warning that you are going toofar. You will see me attack a live one if you are not careful."
"Meaning me, of course. This wounds me more than any number of injuriousand unkind speeches could do. In gratitude to one's benefactor--"
"Benefactor? What do I owe you, I should like to know?"
"You owe me your life. I stood between the trees and the foe, and kepthundreds and thousands of the enemy at bay when they were thirsting foryour blood. And I did not do it to display my daring. I did it because Iloved you and could not live without you."
"There--you have said enough! I will not stay here to listen to theseinfamies. I can endure your lies, but not your love. Keep that corruptionfor somebody with a stronger stomach than mine. And I want to say this,before I go. That you people's small performances might appear the betterand win you the more glory, I hid my own deeds through all the march. Iwent always to the front, where the fighting was thickest, to be remotefrom you in order that you might not see and be discouraged by the thingsI did to the enemy. It was my purpose to keep this a secret in my ownbreast, but you force me to reveal it. If you ask for my witnesses,yonder they lie, on the road we have come. I found that road mud, I pavedit with corpses. I found that country sterile, I fertilized it withblood. Time and again I was urged to go to the rear because the commandcould not proceed on account of my dead. And yet you, you miscreant,accuse me of climbing trees! Pah!"
And he strode out, with a lofty air, for the recital of his imaginarydeeds had already set him up again and made him feel good.
Next day we mounted and faced toward Chinon. Orleans was at our back now,and close by, lying in the strangling grip of the English; soon, pleaseGod, we would face about and go to their relief. From Gien the news hadspread to Orleans that the peasant Maid of Vaucouleurs was on her way,divinely commissioned to raise the siege. The news made a greatexcitement and raised a great hope--the first breath of hope those poorsouls had breathed in five months. They sent commissioners at once to theKing to beg him to consider this matter, and not throw this help lightlyaway. These commissioners were already at Chinon by this time.
When we were half-way to Chinon we happened upon yet one more squad ofenemies. They burst suddenly out of the woods, and in considerable force,too; but we were not the apprentices we were ten or twelve days before;no, we were seasoned to this kind of adventure now; our hearts did notjump into our throats and our weapons tremble in our hands. We hadlearned to be always in battle array, always alert, and always ready todeal with any emergency that might turn up. We were no more dismayed bythe sight of those people than our commander was. Before they could form,Joan had delivered the order, "Forward!" and we were down upon them witha rush. They stood no chance; they turned tail and scattered, we plowingthrough them as if they had been men of straw. That was our lastambuscade, and it was probably laid for us by that treacherous rascal,the King's own minister and favorite, De la Tremouille.
We housed ourselves in an inn, and soon the town came flocking to get aglimpse of the Maid.
Ah, the tedious King and his tedious people! Our two good knights camepresently, their patience well wearied, and reported. They and wereverently stood--as becomes persons who are in the presence of kings andthe superiors of kings--until Joan, troubled by this mark of homage andrespect, and not content with it nor yet used to it, although we had notpermitted ourselves to do otherwise since the day she prophesied thatwretched traitor's death and he was straightway drowned, thus confirmingmany previous signs that she was indeed an ambassador commissioned ofGod, commanded us to sit; then the Sieur de Metz said to Joan:
"The King has got the letter, but they will not let us have speech withhim."
"Who is it that forbids?"
"None forbids, but there be three or four that are nearest hisperson--schemers and traitors every one--that put obstructions in theway, and seek all ways, by lies and pretexts, to make delay. Chiefest ofthese are Georges de la Tremouille and that plotting fox, the Archbishopof Rheims. While they keep the King idle and in bondage to his sports andfollies, they are great and their importance grows; whereas if ever heassert himself and rise and strike for crown and country like a man,their reign is done. So they but thrive, they care not if the crown go todestruction and the King with it."
"You have spoken with others besides these?"
"Not of the Court, no--the Court are the meek slaves of those reptiles,and watch their mouths and their actions, acting as they act, thinking asthey think, saying as they say; wherefore they are cold to us, and turnaside and go another way when we appear. But we have spoken with thecommissioners from Orleans. They said with heat: 'It is a marvel that anyman in such desperate case as is the King can moon around in this torpidway, and see his all go to ruin without lifting a finger to stay thedisaster. What a most strange spectacle it is! Here he is, shut up inthis wee corner of the realm like a rat in a trap; his royal shelter thishuge gloomy tomb of a castle, with wormy rags for upholstery and crippledfurniture for use, a very house of desolation; in his treasure fortyfrancs, and not a farthing more, God be witness! no army, nor any shadowof one; and by contrast with his hungry poverty you behold this crownlesspauper and his shoals of fools and favorites tricked out in the gaudiestsilks and velvets you shall find in any Court in Christendom. And lookyou, he knows that when our city falls--as fall it surely will exceptsuccor come swiftly--France falls; he knows that when that day comes hewill be an outlaw and a fugitive, and that behind him the English flagwill float unchallenged over every acre of his great heritage; he knowsthese things, he knows that our faithful city is fighting all solitaryand alone against disease, starvation, and the sword to stay this awfulcalamity, yet he will not strike one blow to save her, he will not hearour prayers, he will not even look upon our faces.' That is what thecommissioners said, and they are in despair."
Joan said, gently:
"It is pity, but they must not despair. The Dauphin will hear thempresently. Tell them so."
She almost always called the King the Dauphin. To her mind he was notKing yet, not being crowned.
"We will tell them so, and it will content them, for they believe youcome from God. The Archbishop and his confederate have for backer thatveteran soldier Raoul de Gaucourt, Grand Master of the Palace, a worthyman, but simply a soldier, with no head for any greater matter. He cannotmake out to see how a country-girl, ignorant of war, can take a sword inher small hand and win victories where the trained generals of Francehave looked for defeats only, for fifty years--and always found them. Andso he lifts his frosty mustache and scoffs."
"When God fights it is but small matter whether the hand that bears Hissword is big or little. He will perceive this in time. Is there none inthat Castle of Chinon who favors us?"
"Yes, the King's mother-in-law, Yolande, Queen of Sicily, who is wise andgood. She spoke with the Sieur Bertrand."
"She favors us, and she hates those others, the King's beguilers," saidBertrand. "She was full of interest, and asked a thousand questions, allof which I answered according to my ability. Then she sat thinking overthese replies until I thought she was lost in a dream and would wake nomore. But it was not so. At last she said, slowly, and as if she weretalking to herself: 'A child of seventeen--a girl--country-bred--untaught--ignorant of war, the use of arms, and the conduct of battles--modest, gentle, shrinking--yet throws away her shepherd's crook andclothes herself in steel, and fights her way through a hundred and fiftyleagues of fear, and comes--she to whom a king must be a dread and awfulpresence--and will stand up before such an one and say, Be not afraid,God has sent me to save you! Ah, whence could come a courage andconviction so sublime as this but from very God Himself!' She was silentagain awhile, thinking and making up her mind; then she said, 'Andwhether she comes of God or no, there is that in her heart that raisesher above men--high above all men that breathe in France to-day--for inher is that mysterious something that puts heart into soldiers, andturns mobs of cowards into armies of fighters that forget what fear iswhen they are in that presence --fighters who go into battle with joy intheir eyes and songs on their lips, and sweep over the field like astorm --that is the spirit that can save France, and that alone, come itwhence it may! It is in her, I do truly believe, for what else couldhave borne up that child on that great march, and made her despise itsdangers and fatigues? The King must see her face to face--and shall!'She dismissed me with those good words, and I know her promise will bekept. They will delay her all they can--those animals--but she will notfail in the end."
"Would she were King!" said the other knight, fervently. "For there islittle hope that the King himself can be stirred out of his lethargy. Heis wholly without hope, and is only thinking of throwing away everythingand flying to some foreign land. The commissioners say there is a spellupon him that makes him hopeless--yes, and that it is shut up in amystery which they cannot fathom."
"I know the mystery," said Joan, with quiet confidence; "I know it, andhe knows it, but no other but God. When I see him I will tell him asecret that will drive away his trouble, then he will hold up his headagain."
I was miserable with curiosity to know what it was that she would tellhim, but she did not say, and I did not expect she would. She was but achild, it is true; but she was not a chatterer to tell great matters andmake herself important to little people; no, she was reserved, and keptthings to herself, as the truly great always do.
The next day Queen Yolande got one victory over the King's keepers, for,in spite of their protestations and obstructions, she procured anaudience for our two knights, and they made the most they could out oftheir opportunity. They told the King what a spotless and beautifulcharacter Joan was, and how great and noble a spirit animated her, andthey implored him to trust in her, believe in her, and have faith thatshe was sent to save France. They begged him to consent to see her. Hewas strongly moved to do this, and promised that he would not drop thematter out of his mind, but would consult with his council about it. Thisbegan to look encouraging. Two hours later there was a great stir below,and the innkeeper came flying up to say a commission of illustriousecclesiastics was come from the King--from the King his very self,understand!--think of this vast honor to his humble little hostelry!--andhe was so overcome with the glory of it that he could hardly find breathenough in his excited body to put the facts into words. They were comefrom the King to speak with the Maid of Vaucouleurs. Then he flewdownstairs, and presently appeared again, backing into the room, andbowing to the ground with every step, in front of four imposing andaustere bishops and their train of servants.
Joan rose, and we all stood. The bishops took seats, and for a while noword was said, for it was their prerogative to speak first, and they wereso astonished to see what a child it was that was making such a noise inthe world and degrading personages of their dignity to the base functionof ambassadors to her in her plebeian tavern, that they could not findany words to say at first. Then presently their spokesman told Joan theywere aware that she had a message for the King, wherefore she was nowcommanded to put it into words, briefly and without waste of time orembroideries of speech.
As for me, I could hardly contain my joy--our message was to reach theKing at last! And there was the same joy and pride and exultation in thefaces of our knights, too, and in those of Joan's brothers. And I knewthat they were all praying--as I was--that the awe which we felt in thepresence of these great dignitaries, and which would have tied ourtongues and locked our jaws, would not affect her in the like degree, butthat she would be enabled to word her message well, and with littlestumbling, and so make a favorable impression here, where it would be sovaluable and so important.
Ah, dear, how little we were expecting what happened then! We were aghastto hear her say what she said. She was standing in a reverent attitude,with her head down and her hands clasped in front of her; for she wasalways reverent toward the consecrated servants of God. When thespokesman had finished, she raised her head and set her calm eye on thosefaces, not any more disturbed by their state and grandeur than a princesswould have been, and said, with all her ordinary simplicity and modestyof voice and manner:
"Ye will forgive me, reverend sirs, but I have no message save for theKing's ear alone."
Those surprised men were dumb for a moment, and their faces flusheddarkly; then the spokesman said:
"Hark ye, to you fling the King's command in his face and refuse todeliver this message of yours to his servants appointed to receive it?"
"God has appointed me to receive it, and another's commandment may nottake precedence of that. I pray you let me have speech for his grace theDauphin."
"Forbear this folly, and come at your message! Deliver it, and waste nomore time about it."
"You err indeed, most reverend fathers in God, and it is not well. I amnot come hither to talk, but to deliver Orleans, and lead the Dauphin tohis good city of Rheims, and set the crown upon his head."
"Is that the message you send to the King?"
But Joan only said, in the simple fashion which was her wont:
"Ye will pardon me for reminding you again--but I have no message to sendto any one."
The King's messengers rose in deep anger and swept out of the placewithout further words, we and Joan kneeling as they passed.
Our countenances were vacant, our hearts full of a sense of disaster. Ourprecious opportunity was thrown away; we could not understand Joan'sconduct, she who had ben so wise until this fatal hour. At last the SieurBertrand found courage to ask her why she had let this great chance toget her message to the King go by.
"Who sent them here?" she asked.
"The King."
"Who moved the King to send them?" She waited for an answer; none came,for we began to see what was in her mind--so she answered herself: "TheDauphin's council moved him to it. Are they enemies to me and to theDauphin's weal, or are they friends?"
"Enemies," answered the Sieur Bertrand.
"If one would have a message go sound and ungarbled, does one choosetraitors and tricksters to send it by?"
I saw that we had been fools, and she wise. They saw it too, so nonefound anything to say. Then she went on:
"They had but small wit that contrived this trap. They thought to get mymessage and seem to deliver it straight, yet deftly twist it from itspurpose. You know that one part of my message is but this--to move theDauphin by argument and reasonings to give me men-at-arms and send me tothe siege. If an enemy carried these in the right words, the exact words,and no word missing, yet left out the persuasions of gesture andsupplicating tone and beseeching looks that inform the words and makethem live, where were the value of that argument--whom could it convince?Be patient, the Dauphin will hear me presently; have no fear."
The Sieur de Metz nodded his head several times, and muttered as tohimself:
"She was right and wise, and we are but dull fools, when all is said."
It was just my thought; I could have said it myself; and indeed it wasthe thought of all there present. A sort of awe crept over us, to thinkhow that untaught girl, taken suddenly and unprepared, was yet able topenetrate the cunning devices of a King's trained advisers and defeatthem. Marveling over this, and astonished at it, we fell silent and spokeno more. We had come to know that she was great in courage, fortitude,endurance, patience, conviction, fidelity to all duties--in all things,indeed, that make a good and trusty soldier and perfect him for his post;now we were beginning to feel that maybe there were greatnesses in herbrain that were even greater than these great qualities of the heart. Itset us thinking.
What Joan did that day bore fruit the very day after. The King wasobliged to respect the spirit of a young girl who could hold her own andstand her ground like that, and he asserted himself sufficiently to puthis respect into an act instead of into polite and empty words. He movedJoan out of that poor inn, and housed her, with us her servants, in theCastle of Courdray, personally confiding her to the care of Madame deBellier, wife of old Raoul de Gaucourt, Master of the Palace. Of course,this royal attention had an immediate result: all the great lords andladies of the Court began to flock there to see and listen to thewonderful girl-soldier that all the world was talking about, and who hadanswered the King's mandate with a bland refusal to obey. Joan charmedthem every one with her sweetness and simplicity and unconsciouseloquence, and all the best and capablest among them recognized thatthere was an indefinable something about her that testified that she wasnot made of common clay, that she was built on a grander plan than themass of mankind, and moved on a loftier plane. These spread her fame. Shealways made friends and advocates that way; neither the high nor the lowcould come within the sound of her voice and the sight of her face and goout from her presence indifferent.
