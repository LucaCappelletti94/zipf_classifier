It is easier to stay out than get out. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The train was now exploring a beautiful hill country, and went twistingin and out through lovely little green valleys. There were severalvarieties of gum trees; among them many giants. Some of them were bodiedand barked like the sycamore; some were of fantastic aspect, and remindedone of the quaint apple trees in Japanese pictures. And there was onepeculiarly beautiful tree whose name and breed I did not know. Thefoliage seemed to consist of big bunches of pine-spines, the lower halfof each bunch a rich brown or old-gold color, the upper half a most vividand strenuous and shouting green. The effect was altogether bewitching.The tree was apparently rare. I should say that the first and lastsamples of it seen by us were not more than half an hour apart. Therewas another tree of striking aspect, a kind of pine, we were told. Itsfoliage was as fine as hair, apparently, and its mass sphered itselfabove the naked straight stem like an explosion of misty smoke. It wasnot a sociable sort; it did not gather in groups or couples, but eachindividual stood far away from its nearest neighbor. It scattered itselfin this spacious and exclusive fashion about the slopes of swellinggrassy great knolls, and stood in the full flood of the wonderfulsunshine; and as far as you could see the tree itself you could also seethe ink-black blot of its shadow on the shining green carpet at its feet.
On some part of this railway journey we saw gorse and broom--importationsfrom England--and a gentleman who came into our compartment on a visittried to tell me which--was which; but as he didn't know, he haddifficulty. He said he was ashamed of his ignorance, but that he hadnever been confronted with the question before during the fifty years andmore that he had spent in Australia, and so he had never happened to getinterested in the matter. But there was no need to be ashamed. The mostof us have his defect. We take a natural interest in novelties, but itis against nature to take an interest in familiar things. The gorse andthe broom were a fine accent in the landscape. Here and there they burstout in sudden conflagrations of vivid yellow against a background ofsober or sombre color, with a so startling effect as to make a body catchhis breath with the happy surprise of it. And then there was the wattle,a native bush or tree, an inspiring cloud of sumptuous yellow bloom. Itis a favorite with the Australians, and has a fine fragrance, a qualityusually wanting in Australian blossoms.
The gentleman who enriched me with the poverty of his formation about thegorse and the broom told me that he came out from England a youth oftwenty and entered the Province of South Australia with thirty-sixshillings in his pocket--an adventurer without trade, profession, orfriends, but with a clearly-defined purpose in his head: he would stayuntil he was worth L200, then go back home. He would allow himself fiveyears for the accumulation of this fortune.
"That was more than fifty years ago," said he. "And here I am, yet."
As he went out at the door he met a friend, and turned and introduced himto me, and the friend and I had a talk and a smoke. I spoke of theprevious conversation and said there something very pathetic about thishalf century of exile, and that I wished the L200 scheme had succeeded.
"With him? Oh, it did. It's not so sad a case. He is modest, and heleft out some of the particulars. The lad reached South Australia justin time to help discover the Burra-Burra copper mines. They turned outL700,000 in the first three years. Up to now they have yieldedL120,000,000. He has had his share. Before that boy had been in thecountry two years he could have gone home and bought a village; he couldgo now and buy a city, I think. No, there is nothing very pathetic abouthis case. He and his copper arrived at just a handy time to save SouthAustralia. It had got mashed pretty flat under the collapse of a landboom a while before." There it is again; picturesque history--Australia's specialty. In 1829 South Australia hadn't a white man in it.In 1836 the British Parliament erected it--still a solitude--into aProvince, and gave it a governor and other governmental machinery.Speculators took hold, now, and inaugurated a vast land scheme, andinvited immigration, encouraging it with lurid promises of sudden wealth.It was well worked in London; and bishops, statesmen, and all ports ofpeople made a rush for the land company's shares. Immigrants soon beganto pour into the region of Adelaide and select town lots and farms in thesand and the mangrove swamps by the sea. The crowds continued to come,prices of land rose high, then higher and still higher, everybody wasprosperous and happy, the boom swelled into gigantic proportions. Avillage of sheet iron huts and clapboard sheds sprang up in the sand, andin these wigwams fashion made display; richly-dressed ladies played oncostly pianos, London swells in evening dress and patent-leather bootswere abundant, and this fine society drank champagne, and in other waysconducted itself in this capital of humble sheds as it had beenaccustomed to do in the aristocratic quarters of the metropolis of theworld. The provincial government put up expensive buildings for its ownuse, and a palace with gardens for the use of its governor. The governorhad a guard, and maintained a court. Roads, wharves, and hospitals werebuilt. All this on credit, on paper, on wind, on inflated and fictitiousvalues--on the boom's moonshine, in fact. This went on handsomely duringfour or five years. Then of a sudden came a smash. Bills for a hugeamount drawn the governor upon the Treasury were dishonored, the landcompany's credit went up in smoke, a panic followed, values fell with arush, the frightened immigrants seized their grips and fled to otherlands, leaving behind them a good imitation of a solitude, where latelyhad been a buzzing and populous hive of men.
Adelaide was indeed almost empty; its population had fallen to 3,000.During two years or more the death-trance continued. Prospect of revivalthere was none; hope of it ceased. Then, as suddenly as the paralysishad come, came the resurrection from it. Those astonishingly rich coppermines were discovered, and the corpse got up and danced.
The wool production began to grow; grain-raising followed--followed sovigorously, too, that four or five years after the copper discovery, thislittle colony, which had had to import its breadstuffs formerly, and payhard prices for them--once $50 a barrel for flour--had become an exporterof grain.
The prosperities continued. After many years Providence, desiring toshow especial regard for New South Wales and exhibit loving interest inits welfare which should certify to all nations the recognition of thatcolony's conspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving,conferred upon it that treasury of inconceivable riches, Broken Hill; andSouth Australia went over the border and took it, giving thanks.
Among our passengers was an American with a unique vocation. Unique is astrong word, but I use it justifiably if I did not misconceive what theAmerican told me; for I understood him to say that in the world there wasnot another man engaged in the business which he was following. He wasbuying the kangaroo-skin crop; buying all of it, both the Australian cropand the Tasmanian; and buying it for an American house in New York. Theprices were not high, as there was no competition, but the year'saggregate of skins would cost him L30,000. I had had the idea that thekangaroo was about extinct in Tasmania and well thinned out on thecontinent. In America the skins are tanned and made into shoes. Afterthe tanning, the leather takes a new name--which I have forgotten--I onlyremember that the new name does not indicate that the kangaroo furnishesthe leather. There was a German competition for a while, some years ago,but that has ceased. The Germans failed to arrive at the secret oftanning the skins successfully, and they withdrew from the business. Nowthen, I suppose that I have seen a man whose occupation is reallyentitled to bear that high epithet--unique. And I suppose that there isnot another occupation in the world that is restricted to the hands of asole person. I can think of no instance of it. There is more than onePope, there is more than one Emperor, there is even more than one livinggod, walking upon the earth and worshiped in all sincerity by largepopulations of men. I have seen and talked with two of these Beingsmyself in India, and I have the autograph of one of them. It can comegood, by and by, I reckon, if I attach it to a "permit."
Approaching Adelaide we dismounted from the train, as the French say, andwere driven in an open carriage over the hills and along their slopes tothe city. It was an excursion of an hour or two, and the charm of itcould not be overstated, I think. The road wound around gaps and gorges,and offered all varieties of scenery and prospect--mountains, crags,country homes, gardens, forests--color, color, color everywhere, and theair fine and fresh, the skies blue, and not a shred of cloud to mar thedownpour of the brilliant sunshine. And finally the mountain gatewayopened, and the immense plain lay spread out below and stretching awayinto dim distances on every hand, soft and delicate and dainty andbeautiful. On its near edge reposed the city.
We descended and entered. There was nothing to remind one of the humblecapital, of buts and sheds of the long-vanished day of the land-boom.No, this was a modern city, with wide streets, compactly built; with finehomes everywhere, embowered in foliage and flowers, and with imposingmasses of public buildings nobly grouped and architecturally beautiful.
There was prosperity, in the air; for another boom was on. Providence,desiring to show especial regard for the neighboring colony on the westcalled Western Australia--and exhibit a loving interest in its welfarewhich should certify to all nations the recognition of that colony'sconspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving, had recentlyconferred upon it that majestic treasury of golden riches, Coolgardie;and now South Australia had gone around the corner and taken it, givingthanks. Everything comes to him who is patient and good, and waits.
But South Australia deserves much, for apparently she is a hospitablehome for every alien who chooses to come; and for his religion, too.She has a population, as per the latest census, of only 320,000-odd, andyet her varieties of religion indicate the presence within her borders ofsamples of people from pretty nearly every part of the globe you canthink of. Tabulated, these varieties of religion make a remarkable show.One would have to go far to find its match. I copy here thiscosmopolitan curiosity, and it comes from the published census: 
Church of England,........... 89,271Roman Catholic,.............. 47,179Wesleyan,.................... 49,159Lutheran,.................... 23,328Presbyterian,................ 18,206Congregationalist,........... 11,882Bible Christian,............. 15,762Primitive Methodist,......... 11,654Baptist,..................... 17,547Christian Brethren,..........    465Methodist New Connexion,.....     39Unitarian,...................    688Church of Christ,............  3,367Society of Friends,..........    100Salvation Army,..............  4,356New Jerusalem Church,........    168Jews,........................    840Protestants (undefined),.....  6,532Mohammedans,.................    299Confucians, etc.,............  3,884Other religions,.............  1,719Object,......................  6,940Not stated,..................  8,046

About 64 roads to the other world.  You see how healthy the religiousatmosphere is.  Anything can live in it.  Agnostics, Atheists,Freethinkers, Infidels, Mormons, Pagans, Indefinites they are all there.And all the big sects of the world can do more than merely live in it:they can spread, flourish, prosper.  All except the Spiritualists and theTheosophists.  That is the most curious feature of this curious table.What is the matter with the specter?  Why do they puff him away?  He is awelcome toy everywhere else in the world.
