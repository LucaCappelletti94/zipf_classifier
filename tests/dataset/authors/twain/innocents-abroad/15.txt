One of our pleasantest visits was to Pere la Chaise, the nationalburying-ground of France, the honored resting-place of some of hergreatest and best children, the last home of scores of illustrious menand women who were born to no titles, but achieved fame by their ownenergy and their own genius. It is a solemn city of winding streets andof miniature marble temples and mansions of the dead gleaming white fromout a wilderness of foliage and fresh flowers. Not every city is so wellpeopled as this, or has so ample an area within its walls. Few palacesexist in any city that are so exquisite in design, so rich in art, socostly in material, so graceful, so beautiful.
We had stood in the ancient church of St. Denis, where the marbleeffigies of thirty generations of kings and queens lay stretched atlength upon the tombs, and the sensations invoked were startling andnovel; the curious armor, the obsolete costumes, the placid faces, thehands placed palm to palm in eloquent supplication--it was a vision ofgray antiquity. It seemed curious enough to be standing face to face, asit were, with old Dagobert I., and Clovis and Charlemagne, those vague,colossal heroes, those shadows, those myths of a thousand years ago! Itouched their dust-covered faces with my finger, but Dagobert was deaderthan the sixteen centuries that have passed over him, Clovis slept wellafter his labor for Christ, and old Charlemagne went on dreaming of hispaladins, of bloody Roncesvalles, and gave no heed to me.
The great names of Pere la Chaise impress one, too, but differently.There the suggestion brought constantly to his mind is, that this placeis sacred to a nobler royalty--the royalty of heart and brain. Everyfaculty of mind, every noble trait of human nature, every high occupationwhich men engage in, seems represented by a famous name. The effect is acurious medley. Davoust and Massena, who wrought in many a battletragedy, are here, and so also is Rachel, of equal renown in mimictragedy on the stage. The Abbe Sicard sleeps here--the first greatteacher of the deaf and dumb--a man whose heart went out to everyunfortunate, and whose life was given to kindly offices in their service;and not far off, in repose and peace at last, lies Marshal Ney, whosestormy spirit knew no music like the bugle call to arms. The man whooriginated public gas-lighting, and that other benefactor who introducedthe cultivation of the potato and thus blessed millions of his starvingcountrymen, lie with the Prince of Masserano, and with exiled queens andprinces of Further India. Gay-Lussac the chemist, Laplace theastronomer, Larrey the surgeon, de Suze the advocate, are here, and withthem are Talma, Bellini, Rubini; de Balzac, Beaumarchais, Beranger;Moliere and Lafontaine, and scores of other men whose names and whoseworthy labors are as familiar in the remote by-places of civilization asare the historic deeds of the kings and princes that sleep in the marblevaults of St. Denis.
But among the thousands and thousands of tombs in Pere la Chaise, thereis one that no man, no woman, no youth of either sex, ever passes bywithout stopping to examine. Every visitor has a sort of indistinct ideaof the history of its dead and comprehends that homage is due there, butnot one in twenty thousand clearly remembers the story of that tomb andits romantic occupants. This is the grave of Abelard and Heloise--agrave which has been more revered, more widely known, more written andsung about and wept over, for seven hundred years, than any other inChristendom save only that of the Saviour. All visitors linger pensivelyabout it; all young people capture and carry away keepsakes and mementoesof it; all Parisian youths and maidens who are disappointed in love comethere to bail out when they are full of tears; yea, many stricken loversmake pilgrimages to this shrine from distant provinces to weep and wailand "grit" their teeth over their heavy sorrows, and to purchase thesympathies of the chastened spirits of that tomb with offerings ofimmortelles and budding flowers.
Go when you will, you find somebody snuffling over that tomb. Go whenyou will, you find it furnished with those bouquets and immortelles. Gowhen you will, you find a gravel-train from Marseilles arriving to supplythe deficiencies caused by memento-cabbaging vandals whose affectionshave miscarried.
Yet who really knows the story of Abelard and Heloise? Precious fewpeople. The names are perfectly familiar to every body, and that isabout all. With infinite pains I have acquired a knowledge of thathistory, and I propose to narrate it here, partly for the honestinformation of the public and partly to show that public that they havebeen wasting a good deal of marketable sentiment very unnecessarily.
 STORY OF ABELARD AND HELOISE
Heloise was born seven hundred and sixty-six years ago. She may have hadparents. There is no telling. She lived with her uncle Fulbert, a canonof the cathedral of Paris. I do not know what a canon of a cathedral is,but that is what he was. He was nothing more than a sort of a mountainhowitzer, likely, because they had no heavy artillery in those days.Suffice it, then, that Heloise lived with her uncle the howitzer and washappy. She spent the most of her childhood in the convent of Argenteuil--never heard of Argenteuil before, but suppose there was really such aplace. She then returned to her uncle, the old gun, or son of a gun, asthe case may be, and he taught her to write and speak Latin, which wasthe language of literature and polite society at that period.
Just at this time, Pierre Abelard, who had already made himself widelyfamous as a rhetorician, came to found a school of rhetoric in Paris.The originality of his principles, his eloquence, and his great physicalstrength and beauty created a profound sensation. He saw Heloise, andwas captivated by her blooming youth, her beauty, and her charmingdisposition. He wrote to her; she answered. He wrote again; sheanswered again. He was now in love. He longed to know her--to speak toher face to face.
His school was near Fulbert's house. He asked Fulbert to allow him tocall. The good old swivel saw here a rare opportunity: his niece, whomhe so much loved, would absorb knowledge from this man, and it would notcost him a cent. Such was Fulbert--penurious.
Fulbert's first name is not mentioned by any author, which isunfortunate. However, George W. Fulbert will answer for him as well asany other. We will let him go at that. He asked Abelard to teach her.
Abelard was glad enough of the opportunity. He came often and staidlong. A letter of his shows in its very first sentence that he cameunder that friendly roof like a cold-hearted villain as he was, with thedeliberate intention of debauching a confiding, innocent girl. This isthe letter:
 "I cannot cease to be astonished at the simplicity of Fulbert; I was as much surprised as if he had placed a lamb in the power of a hungry wolf. Heloise and I, under pretext of study, gave ourselves up wholly to love, and the solitude that love seeks our studies procured for us. Books were open before us, but we spoke oftener of love than philosophy, and kisses came more readily from our lips than words."
And so, exulting over an honorable confidence which to his degradedinstinct was a ludicrous "simplicity," this unmanly Abelard seduced theniece of the man whose guest he was. Paris found it out. Fulbert wastold of it--told often--but refused to believe it. He could notcomprehend how a man could be so depraved as to use the sacred protectionand security of hospitality as a means for the commission of such a crimeas that. But when he heard the rowdies in the streets singing thelove-songs of Abelard to Heloise, the case was too plain--love-songs comenot properly within the teachings of rhetoric and philosophy.
He drove Abelard from his house. Abelard returned secretly and carriedHeloise away to Palais, in Brittany, his native country. Here, shortlyafterward, she bore a son, who, from his rare beauty, was surnamedAstrolabe--William G. The girl's flight enraged Fulbert, and he longedfor vengeance, but feared to strike lest retaliation visit Heloise--forhe still loved her tenderly. At length Abelard offered to marry Heloise--but on a shameful condition: that the marriage should be kept secretfrom the world, to the end that (while her good name remained a wreck, asbefore,) his priestly reputation might be kept untarnished. It was likethat miscreant. Fulbert saw his opportunity and consented. He would seethe parties married, and then violate the confidence of the man who hadtaught him that trick; he would divulge the secret and so remove somewhatof the obloquy that attached to his niece's fame. But the niecesuspected his scheme. She refused the marriage at first; she saidFulbert would betray the secret to save her, and besides, she did notwish to drag down a lover who was so gifted, so honored by the world,and who had such a splendid career before him. It was noble,self-sacrificing love, and characteristic of the pure-souled Heloise,but it was not good sense.
But she was overruled, and the private marriage took place. Now forFulbert! The heart so wounded should be healed at last; the proud spiritso tortured should find rest again; the humbled head should be lifted uponce more. He proclaimed the marriage in the high places of the city andrejoiced that dishonor had departed from his house. But lo! Abelarddenied the marriage! Heloise denied it! The people, knowing the formercircumstances, might have believed Fulbert had only Abelard denied it,but when the person chiefly interested--the girl herself--denied it, theylaughed, despairing Fulbert to scorn.
The poor canon of the cathedral of Paris was spiked again. The last hopeof repairing the wrong that had been done his house was gone. What next?Human nature suggested revenge. He compassed it. The historian says:
 "Ruffians, hired by Fulbert, fell upon Abelard by night, and inflicted upon him a terrible and nameless mutilation."
I am seeking the last resting place of those "ruffians." When I find itI shall shed some tears on it, and stack up some bouquets andimmortelles, and cart away from it some gravel whereby to remember thathowsoever blotted by crime their lives may have been, these ruffians didone just deed, at any rate, albeit it was not warranted by the strictletter of the law.
Heloise entered a convent and gave good-bye to the world and itspleasures for all time. For twelve years she never heard of Abelard--never even heard his name mentioned. She had become prioress ofArgenteuil and led a life of complete seclusion. She happened one day tosee a letter written by him, in which he narrated his own history. Shecried over it and wrote him. He answered, addressing her as his "sisterin Christ." They continued to correspond, she in the unweighed languageof unwavering affection, he in the chilly phraseology of the polishedrhetorician. She poured out her heart in passionate, disjointedsentences; he replied with finished essays, divided deliberately intoheads and sub-heads, premises and argument. She showered upon him thetenderest epithets that love could devise, he addressed her from theNorth Pole of his frozen heart as the "Spouse of Christ!" The abandonedvillain!
On account of her too easy government of her nuns, some disreputableirregularities were discovered among them, and the Abbot of St. Denisbroke up her establishment. Abelard was the official head of themonastery of St. Gildas de Ruys, at that time, and when he heard of herhomeless condition a sentiment of pity was aroused in his breast (it is awonder the unfamiliar emotion did not blow his head off,) and he placedher and her troop in the little oratory of the Paraclete, a religiousestablishment which he had founded. She had many privations andsufferings to undergo at first, but her worth and her gentle dispositionwon influential friends for her, and she built up a wealthy andflourishing nunnery. She became a great favorite with the heads of thechurch, and also the people, though she seldom appeared in public. Sherapidly advanced in esteem, in good report, and in usefulness, andAbelard as rapidly lost ground. The Pope so honored her that he made herthe head of her order. Abelard, a man of splendid talents, and rankingas the first debater of his time, became timid, irresolute, anddistrustful of his powers. He only needed a great misfortune to topplehim from the high position he held in the world of intellectualexcellence, and it came. Urged by kings and princes to meet the subtleSt. Bernard in debate and crush him, he stood up in the presence of aroyal and illustrious assemblage, and when his antagonist had finished helooked about him and stammered a commencement; but his courage failedhim, the cunning of his tongue was gone: with his speech unspoken, hetrembled and sat down, a disgraced and vanquished champion.
He died a nobody, and was buried at Cluny, A.D., 1144. They removed hisbody to the Paraclete afterward, and when Heloise died, twenty yearslater, they buried her with him, in accordance with her last wish. Hedied at the ripe age of 64, and she at 63. After the bodies had remainedentombed three hundred years, they were removed once more. They wereremoved again in 1800, and finally, seventeen years afterward, they weretaken up and transferred to Pere la Chaise, where they will remain inpeace and quiet until it comes time for them to get up and move again.
History is silent concerning the last acts of the mountain howitzer. Letthe world say what it will about him, I, at least, shall always respectthe memory and sorrow for the abused trust and the broken heart and thetroubled spirit of the old smooth-bore. Rest and repose be his!
Such is the story of Abelard and Heloise. Such is the history thatLamartine has shed such cataracts of tears over. But that man nevercould come within the influence of a subject in the least patheticwithout overflowing his banks. He ought to be dammed--or leveed, Ishould more properly say. Such is the history--not as it is usuallytold, but as it is when stripped of the nauseous sentimentality thatwould enshrine for our loving worship a dastardly seducer like PierreAbelard. I have not a word to say against the misused, faithful girl,and would not withhold from her grave a single one of those simpletributes which blighted youths and maidens offer to her memory, but I amsorry enough that I have not time and opportunity to write four or fivevolumes of my opinion of her friend the founder of the Parachute, or theParaclete, or whatever it was.
The tons of sentiment I have wasted on that unprincipled humbug in myignorance! I shall throttle down my emotions hereafter, about this sortof people, until I have read them up and know whether they are entitledto any tearful attentions or not. I wish I had my immortelles back, now,and that bunch of radishes.
In Paris we often saw in shop windows the sign "English Spoken Here,"just as one sees in the windows at home the sign "Ici on parlefrancaise." We always invaded these places at once--and invariablyreceived the information, framed in faultless French, that the clerk whodid the English for the establishment had just gone to dinner and wouldbe back in an hour--would Monsieur buy something? We wondered why thoseparties happened to take their dinners at such erratic and extraordinaryhours, for we never called at a time when an exemplary Christian would bein the least likely to be abroad on such an errand. The truth was, itwas a base fraud--a snare to trap the unwary--chaff to catch fledglingswith. They had no English-murdering clerk. They trusted to the sign toinveigle foreigners into their lairs, and trusted to their ownblandishments to keep them there till they bought something.
We ferreted out another French imposition--a frequent sign to thiseffect: "ALL MANNER OF AMERICAN DRINKS ARTISTICALLY PREPARED HERE." Weprocured the services of a gentleman experienced in the nomenclature ofthe American bar, and moved upon the works of one of these impostors. Abowing, aproned Frenchman skipped forward and said:
"Que voulez les messieurs?" I do not know what "Que voulez lesmessieurs?" means, but such was his remark.
Our general said, "We will take a whiskey straight."
[A stare from the Frenchman.]
"Well, if you don't know what that is, give us a champagne cock-tail."
[A stare and a shrug.]
"Well, then, give us a sherry cobbler."
The Frenchman was checkmated. This was all Greek to him.
"Give us a brandy smash!"
The Frenchman began to back away, suspicious of the ominous vigor of thelast order--began to back away, shrugging his shoulders and spreading hishands apologetically.
The General followed him up and gained a complete victory. Theuneducated foreigner could not even furnish a Santa Cruz Punch, anEye-Opener, a Stone-Fence, or an Earthquake. It was plain that he was awicked impostor.
An acquaintance of mine said the other day that he was doubtless the onlyAmerican visitor to the Exposition who had had the high honor of beingescorted by the Emperor's bodyguard. I said with unobtrusive franknessthat I was astonished that such a long-legged, lantern-jawed,unprepossessing-looking specter as he should be singled out for adistinction like that, and asked how it came about. He said he hadattended a great military review in the Champ de Mars some time ago, andwhile the multitude about him was growing thicker and thicker everymoment he observed an open space inside the railing. He left hiscarriage and went into it. He was the only person there, and so he hadplenty of room, and the situation being central, he could see all thepreparations going on about the field. By and by there was a sound ofmusic, and soon the Emperor of the French and the Emperor of Austria,escorted by the famous Cent Gardes, entered the enclosure. They seemednot to observe him, but directly, in response to a sign from thecommander of the guard, a young lieutenant came toward him with a file ofhis men following, halted, raised his hand, and gave the military salute,and then said in a low voice that he was sorry to have to disturb astranger and a gentleman, but the place was sacred to royalty. Then thisNew Jersey phantom rose up and bowed and begged pardon, then with theofficer beside him, the file of men marching behind him, and with everymark of respect, he was escorted to his carriage by the imperial CentGardes! The officer saluted again and fell back, the New Jersey spritebowed in return and had presence of mind enough to pretend that he hadsimply called on a matter of private business with those emperors, and sowaved them an adieu and drove from the field!
Imagine a poor Frenchman ignorantly intruding upon a public rostrumsacred to some six-penny dignitary in America. The police would scarehim to death first with a storm of their elegant blasphemy, and then pullhim to pieces getting him away from there. We are measurably superior tothe French in some things, but they are immeasurably our betters inothers.
Enough of Paris for the present. We have done our whole duty by it. Wehave seen the Tuileries, the Napoleon Column, the Madeleine, that wonderof wonders the tomb of Napoleon, all the great churches and museums,libraries, imperial palaces, and sculpture and picture galleries, thePantheon, Jardin des Plantes, the opera, the circus, the legislativebody, the billiard rooms, the barbers, the grisettes--
Ah, the grisettes! I had almost forgotten. They are another romanticfraud. They were (if you let the books of travel tell it) always sobeautiful--so neat and trim, so graceful--so naive and trusting--sogentle, so winning--so faithful to their shop duties, so irresistibleto buyers in their prattling importunity--so devoted to theirpoverty-stricken students of the Latin Quarter--so lighthearted andhappy on their Sunday picnics in the suburbs--and oh, so charmingly,so delightfully immoral!
Stuff! For three or four days I was constantly saying:
"Quick, Ferguson! Is that a grisette?"
And he always said, "No."
He comprehended at last that I wanted to see a grisette. Then he showedme dozens of them. They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw--homely. They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pugnoses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good breedingcould overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting;they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; Iknew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly andfinally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.
Aroint thee, wench! I sorrow for the vagabond student of the LatinQuarter now, even more than formerly I envied him. Thus topples to earthanother idol of my infancy.
We have seen every thing, and tomorrow we go to Versailles. We shall seeParis only for a little while as we come back to take up our line ofmarch for the ship, and so I may as well bid the beautiful city aregretful farewell. We shall travel many thousands of miles after weleave here and visit many great cities, but we shall find none soenchanting as this.
Some of our party have gone to England, intending to take a roundaboutcourse and rejoin the vessel at Leghorn or Naples several weeks hence.We came near going to Geneva, but have concluded to return to Marseillesand go up through Italy from Genoa.
I will conclude this chapter with a remark that I am sincerely proud tobe able to make--and glad, as well, that my comrades cordially endorseit, to wit: by far the handsomest women we have seen in France were bornand reared in America.
I feel now like a man who has redeemed a failing reputation and shedluster upon a dimmed escutcheon, by a single just deed done at theeleventh hour.
Let the curtain fall, to slow music.
