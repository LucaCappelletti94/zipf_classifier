  Out of the darkness, fretted sometimes in its sleeping,	Jets of sparks in fountains of blue come leaping	To sight, revealing a secret, numberless secrets keeping.	 Sometimes the darkness trapped within a wheel	Runs into speed like a dream, the blue of the steel Showing the rocking darkness now a-reel.	 And out of the invisible, streams of bright blue drops	Rain from the showery heavens, and bright blue crops	Surge from the under-dark to their ladder-tops.	 And all the manifold blue and joyous eyes, The rainbow arching over in the skies,	New sparks of wonder opening in surprise.	 All these pure things come foam and spray of the sea	Of Darkness abundant, which shaken mysteriously,	Breaks into dazzle of living, as dolphins that leap from the sea Of midnight shake it to fire, so the secret of death we see.
