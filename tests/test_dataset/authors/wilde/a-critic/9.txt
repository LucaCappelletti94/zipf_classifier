(Pall Mall Gazette, April 21, 1886)


A philosophic politician once remarked that the best possible form of
government is an absolute monarchy tempered by street ballads.
Without at all agreeing with this aphorism we still cannot but regret
that the new democracy does not use poetry as a means for the expression
of political opinion. The Socialists, it is true, have been heard
singing the later poems of Mr. William Morris, but the street ballad is
really dead in England. The fact is that most modern poetry is so
artificial in its form, so individual in its essence and so literary in
its style, that the people as a body are little moved by it, and when
they have grievances against the capitalist or the aristocrat they prefer
strikes to sonnets and rioting to rondels.
Possibly, Mr. William Toynbee's pleasant little volume of translations
from Beranger may be the herald of a new school. Beranger had all the
qualifications for a popular poet. He wrote to be sung more than to be
read; he preferred the Pont Neuf to Parnassus; he was patriotic as well
as romantic, and humorous as well as humane. Translations of poetry as a
rule are merely misrepresentations, but the muse of Beranger is so simple
and naive that she can wear our English dress with ease and grace, and
Mr. Toynbee has kept much of the mirth and music of the original. Here
and there, undoubtedly, the translation could be improved upon; 'rapiers'
for instance is an abominable rhyme to 'forefathers'; 'the hated arms of
Albion' in the same poem is a very feeble rendering of 'le leopard de
l'Anglais,' and such a verse as
    'Mid France's miracles of art,
       Rare trophies won from art's own land,
    I've lived to see with burning heart
       The fog-bred poor triumphant stand,

reproduces very inadequately the charm of the original:
    Dans nos palais, ou, pres de la victoire,
    Brillaient les arts, doux fruits des beaux climats,
    J'ai vu du Nord les peuplades sans gloire,
    De leurs manteaux secouer les frimas.
On the whole, however, Mr. Toynbee's work is good; Les Champs, for
example, is very well translated, and so are the two delightful poems
Rosette and Ma Republique; and there is a good deal of spirit in Le
Marquis de Carabas:
    Whom have we here in conqueror's role?
    Our grand old marquis, bless his soul!
    Whose grand old charger (mark his bone!)
    Has borne him back to claim his own.
    Note, if you please, the grand old style
    In which he nears his grand old pile;
    With what an air of grand old state
    He waves that blade immaculate!
       Hats off, hats off, for my lord to pass,
       The grand old Marquis of Carabas!--



though 'that blade immaculate' has hardly got the sting of 'un sabre
innocent'; and in the fourth verse of the same poem, 'Marquise, you'll
have the bed-chamber' does not very clearly convey the sense of the line
'La Marquise a le tabouret.' Beranger is not nearly well enough known in
England, and though it is always better to read a poet in the original,
still translations have their value as echoes have their music.
