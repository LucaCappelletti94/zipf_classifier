We are camped near Temnin-el-Foka--a name which the boys have simplifieda good deal, for the sake of convenience in spelling. They call itJacksonville. It sounds a little strangely, here in the Valley ofLebanon, but it has the merit of being easier to remember than the Arabicname. 
                     "COME LIKE SPIRITS, SO DEPART."
                 "The night shall be filled with music,                   And the cares that infest the day                 Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,                      And as silently steal away."

I slept very soundly last night, yet when the dragoman's bell rang athalf-past five this morning and the cry went abroad of "Ten minutes todress for breakfast!" I heard both. It surprised me, because I have notheard the breakfast gong in the ship for a month, and whenever we havehad occasion to fire a salute at daylight, I have only found it out inthe course of conversation afterward. However, camping out, even thoughit be in a gorgeous tent, makes one fresh and lively in the morning--especially if the air you are breathing is the cool, fresh air of themountains.
I was dressed within the ten minutes, and came out. The saloon tent hadbeen stripped of its sides, and had nothing left but its roof; so when wesat down to table we could look out over a noble panorama of mountain,sea and hazy valley. And sitting thus, the sun rose slowly up andsuffused the picture with a world of rich coloring.
Hot mutton chops, fried chicken, omelettes, fried potatoes and coffee--all excellent. This was the bill of fare. It was sauced with a savageappetite purchased by hard riding the day before, and refreshing sleep ina pure atmosphere. As I called for a second cup of coffee, I glancedover my shoulder, and behold our white village was gone--the splendidtents had vanished like magic! It was wonderful how quickly those Arabshad "folded their tents;" and it was wonderful, also, how quickly theyhad gathered the thousand odds and ends of the camp together anddisappeared with them.
By half-past six we were under way, and all the Syrian world seemed to beunder way also. The road was filled with mule trains and longprocessions of camels. This reminds me that we have been trying for sometime to think what a camel looks like, and now we have made it out. Whenhe is down on all his knees, flat on his breast to receive his load, helooks something like a goose swimming; and when he is upright he lookslike an ostrich with an extra set of legs. Camels are not beautiful, andtheir long under lip gives them an exceedingly "gallus"--[Excuse theslang, no other word will describe it]--expression. They have immense,flat, forked cushions of feet, that make a track in the dust like a piewith a slice cut out of it. They are not particular about their diet.They would eat a tombstone if they could bite it. A thistle grows abouthere which has needles on it that would pierce through leather, I think;if one touches you, you can find relief in nothing but profanity. Thecamels eat these. They show by their actions that they enjoy them. Isuppose it would be a real treat to a camel to have a keg of nails forsupper.
While I am speaking of animals, I will mention that I have a horse now bythe name of "Jericho." He is a mare. I have seen remarkable horsesbefore, but none so remarkable as this. I wanted a horse that could shy,and this one fills the bill. I had an idea that shying indicated spirit.If I was correct, I have got the most spirited horse on earth. He shiesat every thing he comes across, with the utmost impartiality. He appearsto have a mortal dread of telegraph poles, especially; and it isfortunate that these are on both sides of the road, because as it is now,I never fall off twice in succession on the same side. If I fell on thesame side always, it would get to be monotonous after a while. Thiscreature has scared at every thing he has seen to-day, except a haystack.He walked up to that with an intrepidity and a recklessness that wereastonishing. And it would fill any one with admiration to see how hepreserves his self-possession in the presence of a barley sack. Thisdare-devil bravery will be the death of this horse some day.
He is not particularly fast, but I think he will get me through the HolyLand. He has only one fault. His tail has been chopped off or else hehas sat down on it too hard, some time or other, and he has to fight theflies with his heels. This is all very well, but when he tries to kick afly off the top of his head with his hind foot, it is too much variety.He is going to get himself into trouble that way some day. He reachesaround and bites my legs too. I do not care particularly about that,only I do not like to see a horse too sociable.
I think the owner of this prize had a wrong opinion about him. He had anidea that he was one of those fiery, untamed steeds, but he is not ofthat character. I know the Arab had this idea, because when he broughtthe horse out for inspection in Beirout, he kept jerking at the bridleand shouting in Arabic, "Ho! will you? Do you want to run away, youferocious beast, and break your neck?" when all the time the horse wasnot doing anything in the world, and only looked like he wanted to leanup against something and think. Whenever he is not shying at things, orreaching after a fly, he wants to do that yet. How it would surprise hisowner to know this.
We have been in a historical section of country all day. At noon wecamped three hours and took luncheon at Mekseh, near the junction of theLebanon Mountains and the Jebel el Kuneiyiseh, and looked down into theimmense, level, garden-like Valley of Lebanon. To-night we are campingnear the same valley, and have a very wide sweep of it in view. We cansee the long, whale-backed ridge of Mount Hermon projecting above theeastern hills. The "dews of Hermon" are falling upon us now, and thetents are almost soaked with them.
Over the way from us, and higher up the valley, we can discern, throughthe glasses, the faint outlines of the wonderful ruins of Baalbec, thesupposed Baal-Gad of Scripture. Joshua, and another person, were the twospies who were sent into this land of Canaan by the children of Israel toreport upon its character--I mean they were the spies who reportedfavorably. They took back with them some specimens of the grapes of thiscountry, and in the children's picture-books they are always representedas bearing one monstrous bunch swung to a pole between them, arespectable load for a pack-train. The Sunday-school books exaggeratedit a little. The grapes are most excellent to this day, but the bunchesare not as large as those in the pictures. I was surprised and hurt whenI saw them, because those colossal bunches of grapes were one of my mostcherished juvenile traditions.
Joshua reported favorably, and the children of Israel journeyed on, withMoses at the head of the general government, and Joshua in command of thearmy of six hundred thousand fighting men. Of women and children andcivilians there was a countless swarm. Of all that mighty host, none butthe two faithful spies ever lived to set their feet in the Promised Land.They and their descendants wandered forty years in the desert, and thenMoses, the gifted warrior, poet, statesman and philosopher, went up intoPisgah and met his mysterious fate. Where he was buried no man knows--for 
          "* * * no man dug that sepulchre,          And no man saw it e'er          --For the Sons of God upturned the sod          And laid the dead man there!"
Then Joshua began his terrible raid, and from Jericho clear to thisBaal-Gad, he swept the land like the Genius of Destruction. Heslaughtered the people, laid waste their soil, and razed their cities tothe ground. He wasted thirty-one kings also. One may call it that,though really it can hardly be called wasting them, because there werealways plenty of kings in those days, and to spare. At any rate, hedestroyed thirty-one kings, and divided up their realms among hisIsraelites. He divided up this valley stretched out here before us, andso it was once Jewish territory. The Jews have long since disappearedfrom it, however.
Back yonder, an hour's journey from here, we passed through an Arabvillage of stone dry-goods boxes (they look like that,) where Noah's tomblies under lock and key. [Noah built the ark.] Over these old hills andvalleys the ark that contained all that was left of a vanished world oncefloated.
I make no apology for detailing the above information. It will be newsto some of my readers, at any rate.
Noah's tomb is built of stone, and is covered with a long stone building.Bucksheesh let us in. The building had to be long, because the grave ofthe honored old navigator is two hundred and ten feet long itself! It isonly about four feet high, though. He must have cast a shadow like alightning-rod. The proof that this is the genuine spot where Noah wasburied can only be doubted by uncommonly incredulous people. Theevidence is pretty straight. Shem, the son of Noah, was present at theburial, and showed the place to his descendants, who transmitted theknowledge to their descendants, and the lineal descendants of theseintroduced themselves to us to-day. It was pleasant to make theacquaintance of members of so respectable a family. It was a thing to beproud of. It was the next thing to being acquainted with Noah himself.
Noah's memorable voyage will always possess a living interest for me,henceforward.
If ever an oppressed race existed, it is this one we see fettered aroundus under the inhuman tyranny of the Ottoman Empire. I wish Europe wouldlet Russia annihilate Turkey a little--not much, but enough to make itdifficult to find the place again without a divining-rod or adiving-bell. The Syrians are very poor, and yet they are ground down bya system of taxation that would drive any other nation frantic. Lastyear their taxes were heavy enough, in all conscience--but this yearthey have been increased by the addition of taxes that were forgiventhem in times of famine in former years. On top of this the Governmenthas levied a tax of one-tenth of the whole proceeds of the land. Thisis only half the story. The Pacha of a Pachalic does not troublehimself with appointing tax-collectors. He figures up what all thesetaxes ought to amount to in a certain district. Then he farms thecollection out. He calls the rich men together, the highest bidder getsthe speculation, pays the Pacha on the spot, and then sells out tosmaller fry, who sell in turn to a piratical horde of still smaller fry.These latter compel the peasant to bring his little trifle of grain tothe village, at his own cost. It must be weighed, the various taxes setapart, and the remainder returned to the producer. But the collectordelays this duty day after day, while the producer's family areperishing for bread; at last the poor wretch, who can not but understandthe game, says, "Take a quarter--take half--take two-thirds if you will,and let me go!" It is a most outrageous state of things.
These people are naturally good-hearted and intelligent, and witheducation and liberty, would be a happy and contented race. They oftenappeal to the stranger to know if the great world will not some day cometo their relief and save them. The Sultan has been lavishing money likewater in England and Paris, but his subjects are suffering for it now.
This fashion of camping out bewilders me. We have boot-jacks and abath-tub, now, and yet all the mysteries the pack-mules carry are notrevealed. What next?
