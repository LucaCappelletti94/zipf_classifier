  I listed to the stillness of you,	 My dear, among it all;	I feel your silence touch my words as I talk,	 And take them in thrall.	 My words fly off a forge  The length of a spark;	I see the night-sky easily sip them	 Up in the dark.	 The lark sings loud and glad,	 Yet I am not loth That silence should take the song and the bird	 And lose them both.	 A train goes roaring south,	 The steam-flag flying;	I see the stealthy shadow of silence  Alongside going.	 And off the forge of the world,	 Whirling in the draught of life,	Go sparks of myriad people, filling	 The night with strife.  Yet they never change the darkness	 Or blench it with noise;	Alone on the perfect silence	 The stars are buoys.
