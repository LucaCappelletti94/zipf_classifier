In the early eighties Mark Twain learned to ride one of theold high-wheel bicycles of that period. He wrote an account ofhis experience, but did not offer it for publication. The formof bicycle he rode long ago became antiquated, but in the humorof his pleasantry is a quality which does not grow old.A. B. P.II thought the matter over, and concluded I could do it. SoI went down a bought a barrel of Pond's Extract and a bicycle.The Expert came home with me to instruct me. We chose theback yard, for the sake of privacy, and went to work.Mine was not a full-grown bicycle, but only a colt--afifty-inch, with the pedals shortened up to forty-eight--andskittish, like any other colt. The Expert explained the thing'spoints briefly, then he got on its back and rode around a little,to show me how easy it was to do. He said that the dismountingwas perhaps the hardest thing to learn, and so we would leavethat to the last. But he was in error there. He found, to hissurprise and joy, that all that he needed to do was to get me onto the machine and stand out of the way; I could get off, myself.Although I was wholly inexperienced, I dismounted in the besttime on record. He was on that side, shoving up the machine;we all came down with a crash, he at the bottom, I next,and the machine on top.We examined the machine, but it was not in the leastinjured. This was hardly believable. Yet the Expert assured methat it was true; in fact, the examination proved it. I waspartly to realize, then, how admirably these things areconstructed. We applied some Pond's Extract, and resumed. TheExpert got on the OTHER side to shove up this time, but Idismounted on that side; so the result was as before.The machine was not hurt. We oiled ourselves again, and resumed.This time the Expert took up a sheltered position behind,but somehow or other we landed on him again.He was full of admiration; said it was abnormal. She wasall right, not a scratch on her, not a timber started anywhere.I said it was wonderful, while we were greasing up, but he saidthat when I came to know these steel spider-webs I would realizethat nothing but dynamite could cripple them. Then he limped outto position, and we resumed once more. This time the Expert tookup the position of short-stop, and got a man to shove up behind.We got up a handsome speed, and presently traversed a brick, andI went out over the top of the tiller and landed, head down, onthe instructor's back, and saw the machine fluttering in the airbetween me and the sun. It was well it came down on us, for thatbroke the fall, and it was not injured.Five days later I got out and was carried down to thehospital, and found the Expert doing pretty fairly. In a fewmore days I was quite sound. I attribute this to my prudence inalways dismounting on something soft. Some recommend a featherbed, but I think an Expert is better.The Expert got out at last, brought four assistants withhim. It was a good idea. These four held the graceful cobwebupright while I climbed into the saddle; then they formed incolumn and marched on either side of me while the Expert pushedbehind; all hands assisted at the dismount.The bicycle had what is called the "wabbles," and had themvery badly. In order to keep my position, a good many thingswere required of me, and in every instance the thing required wasagainst nature. That is to say, that whatever the needed thingmight be, my nature, habit, and breeding moved me to attempt itin one way, while some immutable and unsuspected law of physicsrequired that it be done in just the other way. I perceived bythis how radically and grotesquely wrong had been the life-longeducation of my body and members. They were steeped inignorance; they knew nothing--nothing which it could profit themto know. For instance, if I found myself falling to the right, Iput the tiller hard down the other way, by a quite naturalimpulse, and so violated a law, and kept on going down. The lawrequired the opposite thing--the big wheel must be turned in thedirection in which you are falling. It is hard to believe this,when you are told it. And not merely hard to believe it, butimpossible; it is opposed to all your notions. And it is just ashard to do it, after you do come to believe it. Believing it,and knowing by the most convincing proof that it is true, doesnot help it: you can't any more DO it than you could before; youcan neither force nor persuade yourself to do it at first. Theintellect has to come to the front, now. It has to teach thelimbs to discard their old education and adopt the new.The steps of one's progress are distinctly marked. At theend of each lesson he knows he has acquired something, and healso knows what that something is, and likewise that it will staywith him. It is not like studying German, where you mull along,in a groping, uncertain way, for thirty years; and at last, justas you think you've got it, they spring the subjunctive on you,and there you are. No--and I see now, plainly enough, that thegreat pity about the German language is, that you can't fall offit and hurt yourself. There is nothing like that feature to makeyou attend strictly to business. But I also see, by what I havelearned of bicycling, that the right and only sure way to learnGerman is by the bicycling method. That is to say, take a gripon one villainy of it at a time, leaving that one half learned.When you have reached the point in bicycling where you canbalance the machine tolerably fairly and propel it and steer it,then comes your next task--how to mount it. You do it in thisway: you hop along behind it on your right foot, resting theother on the mounting-peg, and grasping the tiller with yourhands. At the word, you rise on the peg, stiffen your left leg,hang your other one around in the air in a general in indefiniteway, lean your stomach against the rear of the saddle, and thenfall off, maybe on one side, maybe on the other; but you fall off.You get up and do it again; and once more; and then several times.By this time you have learned to keep your balance; and alsoto steer without wrenching the tiller out by the roots (I saytiller because it IS a tiller; "handle-bar" is a lamelydescriptive phrase). So you steer along, straight ahead, a littlewhile, then you rise forward, with a steady strain, bringing yourright leg, and then your body, into the saddle, catch yourbreath, fetch a violent hitch this way and then that, and downyou go again.But you have ceased to mind the going down by this time; youare getting to light on one foot or the other with considerablecertainty. Six more attempts and six more falls make youperfect. You land in the saddle comfortably, next time, and staythere--that is, if you can be content to let your legs dangle,and leave the pedals alone a while; but if you grab at once forthe pedals, you are gone again. You soon learn to wait a littleand perfect your balance before reaching for the pedals; then themounting-art is acquired, is complete, and a little practice willmake it simple and easy to you, though spectators ought to keepoff a rod or two to one side, along at first, if you have nothingagainst them.And now you come to the voluntary dismount; you learned theother kind first of all. It is quite easy to tell one how to dothe voluntary dismount; the words are few, the requirementsimple, and apparently undifficult; let your left pedal go downtill your left leg is nearly straight, turn your wheel to theleft, and get off as you would from a horse. It certainly doessound exceedingly easy; but it isn't. I don't know why it isn'tbut it isn't. Try as you may, you don't get down as you wouldfrom a horse, you get down as you would from a house afire. Youmake a spectacle of yourself every time.[=]IIDuring the eight days I took a daily lesson an hour and ahalf. At the end of this twelve working-hours' appreticeship Iwas graduated--in the rough. I was pronounced competent topaddle my own bicycle without outside help. It seems incredible,this celerity of acquirement. It takes considerably longer thanthat to learn horseback-riding in the rough.Now it is true that I could have learned without a teacher,but it would have been risky for me, because of my naturalclumsiness. The self-taught man seldom knows anythingaccurately, and he does not know a tenth as much as he could haveknown if he had worked under teachers; and, besides, he brags,and is the means of fooling other thoughtless people into goingand doing as he himself has done. There are those who imaginethat the unlucky accidents of life--life's "experiences"--are insome way useful to us. I wish I could find out how. I neverknew one of them to happen twice. They always change off andswap around and catch you on your inexperienced side. Ifpersonal experience can be worth anything as an education, itwouldn't seem likely that you could trip Methuselah; and yet ifthat old person could come back here it is more that likely thatone of the first things he would do would be to take hold of oneof these electric wires and tie himself all up in a knot. Nowthe surer thing and the wiser thing would be for him to asksomebody whether it was a good thing to take hold of. But thatwould not suit him; he would be one of the self-taught kind thatgo by experience; he would want to examine for himself. And hewould find, for his instruction, that the coiled patriarch shunsthe electric wire; and it would be useful to him, too, and wouldleave his education in quite a complete and rounded-outcondition, till he should come again, some day, and go tobouncing a dynamite-can around to find out what was in it.But we wander from the point. However, get a teacher; itsaves much time and Pond's Extract.Before taking final leave of me, my instructor inquiredconcerning my physical strength, and I was able to inform himthat I hadn't any. He said that that was a defect which wouldmake up-hill wheeling pretty difficult for me at first; but healso said the bicycle would soon remove it. The contrast betweenhis muscles and mine was quite marked. He wanted to test mine,so I offered my biceps--which was my best. It almost made himsmile. He said, "It is pulpy, and soft, and yielding, androunded; it evades pressure, and glides from under the fingers;in the dark a body might think it was an oyster in a rag."Perhaps this made me look grieved, for he added, briskly: "Oh,that's all right, you needn't worry about that; in a little whileyou can't tell it from a petrified kidney. Just go right alongwith your practice; you're all right."Then he left me, and I started out alone to seek adventures.You don't really have to seek them--that is nothing but a phrase--they come to you.I chose a reposeful Sabbath-day sort of a back street whichwas about thirty yards wide between the curbstones. I knew itwas not wide enough; still, I thought that by keeping strictwatch and wasting no space unnecessarily I could crowd through.Of course I had trouble mounting the machine, entirely on myown responsibility, with no encouraging moral support from theoutside, no sympathetic instructor to say, "Good! now you'redoing well--good again--don't hurry--there, now, you're all right--brace up, go ahead." In place of this I had some othersupport. This was a boy, who was perched on a gate-post munchinga hunk of maple sugar.He was full of interest and comment. The first time Ifailed and went down he said that if he was me he would dress upin pillows, that's what he would do. The next time I went downhe advised me to go and learn to ride a tricycle first. Thethird time I collapsed he said he didn't believe I could stay ona horse-car. But the next time I succeeded, and got clumsilyunder way in a weaving, tottering, uncertain fashion, andoccupying pretty much all of the street. My slow and lumberinggait filled the boy to the chin with scorn, and he sung out, "My,but don't he rip along!" Then he got down from his post andloafed along the sidewalk, still observing and occasionallycommenting. Presently he dropped into my wake and followed alongbehind. A little girl passed by, balancing a wash-board on herhead, and giggled, and seemed about to make a remark, but the boysaid, rebukingly, "Let him alone, he's going to a funeral."I have been familiar with that street for years, and hadalways supposed it was a dead level; but it was not, as thebicycle now informed me, to my surprise. The bicycle, in thehands of a novice, is as alert and acute as a spirit-level in thedetecting the delicate and vanishing shades of difference inthese matters. It notices a rise where your untrained eye wouldnot observe that one existed; it notices any decline which waterwill run down. I was toiling up a slight rise, but was not awareof it. It made me tug and pant and perspire; and still, labor asI might, the machine came almost to a standstill every little while.At such times the boy would say: "That's it! take a rest--there ain't no hurry. They can't hold the funeral without YOU."Stones were a bother to me. Even the smallest ones gave me apanic when I went over them. I could hit any kind of a stone,no matter how small, if I tried to miss it; and of course atfirst I couldn't help trying to do that. It is but natural.It is part of the ass that is put in us all, for someinscrutable reason.It was at the end of my course, at last, and it was necessaryfor me to round to. This is not a pleasant thing, when youundertake it for the first time on your own responsibility,and neither is it likely to succeed. Your confidence oozes away,you fill steadily up with nameless apprehensions, every fiber ofyou is tense with a watchful strain, you start a cautious andgradual curve, but your squirmy nerves are all full of electricanxieties, so the curve is quickly demoralized into a jerky andperilous zigzag; then suddenly the nickel-clad horse takes thebit in its mouth and goes slanting for the curbstone, defying allprayers and all your powers to change its mind--your heart standsstill, your breath hangs fire, your legs forget to work, straighton you go, and there are but a couple of feet between you and thecurb now. And now is the desperate moment, the last chance tosave yourself; of course all your instructions fly out of yourhead, and you whirl your wheel AWAY from the curb instead ofTOWARD it, and so you go sprawling on that granite-boundinhospitable shore. That was my luck; that was my experience. Idragged myself out from under the indestructible bicycle and satdown on the curb to examine.I started on the return trip. It was now that I saw afarmer's wagon poking along down toward me, loaded with cabbages.If I needed anything to perfect the precariousness of my steering,it was just that. The farmer was occupying the middle of the roadwith his wagon, leaving barely fourteen or fifteen yards of spaceon either side. I couldn't shout at him--a beginner can't shout;if he opens his mouth he is gone; he must keep all his attentionon his business. But in this grisly emergency, the boy cameto the rescue, and for once I had to be grateful to him.He kept a sharp lookout on the swiftly varying impulses andinspirations of my bicycle, and shouted to the man accordingly:"To the left! Turn to the left, or this jackass 'll run over you!"The man started to do it. "No, to the right, to the right! Hold on! THAT won't do!--to the left!--to the right!--to theLEFT--right! left--ri-- Stay where you ARE, or you're a goner!"And just then I caught the off horse in the starboard and wentdown in a pile. I said, "Hang it! Couldn't you SEE I was coming?""Yes, I see you was coming, but I couldn't tell which WAY youwas coming. Nobody could--now, COULD they? You couldn'tyourself--now, COULD you? So what could _I_ do?"There was something in that, and so I had the magnanimity tosay so. I said I was no doubt as much to blame as he was.Within the next five days I achieved so much progress thatthe boy couldn't keep up with me. He had to go back to his gate-post, and content himself with watching me fall at long range.There was a row of low stepping-stones across one end of thestreet, a measured yard apart. Even after I got so I could steerpretty fairly I was so afraid of those stones that I always hitthem. They gave me the worst falls I ever got in that street,except those which I got from dogs. I have seen it stated thatno expert is quick enough to run over a dog; that a dog is alwaysable to skip out of his way. I think that that may be true: butI think that the reason he couldn't run over the dog was becausehe was trying to. I did not try to run over any dog. But I ranover every dog that came along. I think it makes a great deal ofdifference. If you try to run over the dog he knows how tocalculate, but if you are trying to miss him he does not know howto calculate, and is liable to jump the wrong way every time. Itwas always so in my experience. Even when I could not hit awagon I could hit a dog that came to see me practice. They allliked to see me practice, and they all came, for there was verylittle going on in our neighborhood to entertain a dog. It tooktime to learn to miss a dog, but I achieved even that.I can steer as well as I want to, now, and I will catch thatboy one of these days and run over HIM if he doesn't reform.Get a bicycle. You will not regret it, if you live.
