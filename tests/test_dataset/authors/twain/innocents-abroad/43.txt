We had a tedious ride of about five hours, in the sun, across the Valleyof Lebanon. It proved to be not quite so much of a garden as it hadseemed from the hill-sides. It was a desert, weed-grown waste, litteredthickly with stones the size of a man's fist. Here and there the nativeshad scratched the ground and reared a sickly crop of grain, but for themost part the valley was given up to a handful of shepherds, whose flockswere doing what they honestly could to get a living, but the chances wereagainst them. We saw rude piles of stones standing near the roadside, atintervals, and recognized the custom of marking boundaries which obtainedin Jacob's time. There were no walls, no fences, no hedges--nothing tosecure a man's possessions but these random heaps of stones. TheIsraelites held them sacred in the old patriarchal times, and these otherArabs, their lineal descendants, do so likewise. An American, ofordinary intelligence, would soon widely extend his property, at anoutlay of mere manual labor, performed at night, under so loose a systemof fencing as this.
The plows these people use are simply a sharpened stick, such as Abrahamplowed with, and they still winnow their wheat as he did--they pile it onthe house-top, and then toss it by shovel-fulls into the air until thewind has blown all the chaff away. They never invent any thing, neverlearn any thing.
We had a fine race, of a mile, with an Arab perched on a camel. Some ofthe horses were fast, and made very good time, but the camel scampered bythem without any very great effort. The yelling and shouting, andwhipping and galloping, of all parties interested, made it anexhilarating, exciting, and particularly boisterous race.
At eleven o'clock, our eyes fell upon the walls and columns of Baalbec, anoble ruin whose history is a sealed book. It has stood there forthousands of years, the wonder and admiration of travelers; but who builtit, or when it was built, are questions that may never be answered. Onething is very sure, though. Such grandeur of design, and such grace ofexecution, as one sees in the temples of Baalbec, have not been equaledor even approached in any work of men's hands that has been built withintwenty centuries past.
The great Temple of the Sun, the Temple of Jupiter, and several smallertemples, are clustered together in the midst of one of these miserableSyrian villages, and look strangely enough in such plebeian company.These temples are built upon massive substructions that might support aworld, almost; the materials used are blocks of stone as large as anomnibus--very few, if any of them, are smaller than a carpenter's toolchest--and these substructions are traversed by tunnels of masonrythrough which a train of cars might pass. With such foundations asthese, it is little wonder that Baalbec has lasted so long. The Templeof the Sun is nearly three hundred feet long and one hundred and sixtyfeet wide. It had fifty-four columns around it, but only six arestanding now--the others lie broken at its base, a confused andpicturesque heap. The six columns are their bases, Corinthian capitalsand entablature--and six more shapely columns do not exist. The columnsand the entablature together are ninety feet high--a prodigious altitudefor shafts of stone to reach, truly--and yet one only thinks of theirbeauty and symmetry when looking at them; the pillars look slender anddelicate, the entablature, with its elaborate sculpture, looks like richstucco-work. But when you have gazed aloft till your eyes are weary, youglance at the great fragments of pillars among which you are standing,and find that they are eight feet through; and with them lie beautifulcapitals apparently as large as a small cottage; and also single slabs ofstone, superbly sculptured, that are four or five feet thick, and wouldcompletely cover the floor of any ordinary parlor. You wonder wherethese monstrous things came from, and it takes some little time tosatisfy yourself that the airy and graceful fabric that towers above yourhead is made up of their mates. It seems too preposterous.
The Temple of Jupiter is a smaller ruin than the one I have been speakingof, and yet is immense. It is in a tolerable state of preservation. Onerow of nine columns stands almost uninjured. They are sixty-five feethigh and support a sort of porch or roof, which connects them with theroof of the building. This porch-roof is composed of tremendous slabs ofstone, which are so finely sculptured on the under side that the worklooks like a fresco from below. One or two of these slabs had fallen,and again I wondered if the gigantic masses of carved stone that layabout me were no larger than those above my head. Within the temple, theornamentation was elaborate and colossal. What a wonder of architecturalbeauty and grandeur this edifice must have been when it was new! Andwhat a noble picture it and its statelier companion, with the chaos ofmighty fragments scattered about them, yet makes in the moonlight!
I can not conceive how those immense blocks of stone were ever hauledfrom the quarries, or how they were ever raised to the dizzy heights theyoccupy in the temples. And yet these sculptured blocks are trifles insize compared with the rough-hewn blocks that form the wide verandah orplatform which surrounds the Great Temple. One stretch of that platform,two hundred feet long, is composed of blocks of stone as large, and someof them larger, than a street-car. They surmount a wall about ten ortwelve feet high. I thought those were large rocks, but they sank intoinsignificance compared with those which formed another section of theplatform. These were three in number, and I thought that each of themwas about as long as three street cars placed end to end, though ofcourse they are a third wider and a third higher than a street car.Perhaps two railway freight cars of the largest pattern, placed end toend, might better represent their size. In combined length these threestones stretch nearly two hundred feet; they are thirteen feet square;two of them are sixty-four feet long each, and the third is sixty-nine.They are built into the massive wall some twenty feet above the ground.They are there, but how they got there is the question. I have seen thehull of a steamboat that was smaller than one of those stones. All thesegreat walls are as exact and shapely as the flimsy things we build ofbricks in these days. A race of gods or of giants must have inhabitedBaalbec many a century ago. Men like the men of our day could hardlyrear such temples as these.
We went to the quarry from whence the stones of Baalbec were taken. Itwas about a quarter of a mile off, and down hill. In a great pit lay themate of the largest stone in the ruins. It lay there just as the giantsof that old forgotten time had left it when they were called hence--justas they had left it, to remain for thousands of years, an eloquent rebukeunto such as are prone to think slightingly of the men who lived beforethem. This enormous block lies there, squared and ready for thebuilders' hands--a solid mass fourteen feet by seventeen, and but a fewinches less than seventy feet long! Two buggies could be driven abreastof each other, on its surface, from one end of it to the other, and leaveroom enough for a man or two to walk on either side.
One might swear that all the John Smiths and George Wilkinsons, and allthe other pitiful nobodies between Kingdom Come and Baalbec wouldinscribe their poor little names upon the walls of Baalbec's magnificentruins, and would add the town, the county and the State they came from--and swearing thus, be infallibly correct. It is a pity some great ruindoes not fall in and flatten out some of these reptiles, and scare theirkind out of ever giving their names to fame upon any walls or monumentsagain, forever.
Properly, with the sorry relics we bestrode, it was a three days' journeyto Damascus. It was necessary that we should do it in less than two.It was necessary because our three pilgrims would not travel on theSabbath day. We were all perfectly willing to keep the Sabbath day, butthere are times when to keep the letter of a sacred law whose spirit isrighteous, becomes a sin, and this was a case in point. We pleaded forthe tired, ill-treated horses, and tried to show that their faithfulservice deserved kindness in return, and their hard lot compassion. Butwhen did ever self-righteousness know the sentiment of pity? What were afew long hours added to the hardships of some over-taxed brutes whenweighed against the peril of those human souls? It was not the mostpromising party to travel with and hope to gain a higher veneration forreligion through the example of its devotees. We said the Saviour whopitied dumb beasts and taught that the ox must be rescued from the mireeven on the Sabbath day, would not have counseled a forced march likethis. We said the "long trip" was exhausting and therefore dangerous inthe blistering heats of summer, even when the ordinary days' stages weretraversed, and if we persisted in this hard march, some of us might bestricken down with the fevers of the country in consequence of it.Nothing could move the pilgrims. They must press on. Men might die,horses might die, but they must enter upon holy soil next week, with noSabbath-breaking stain upon them. Thus they were willing to commit a sinagainst the spirit of religious law, in order that they might preservethe letter of it. It was not worth while to tell them "the letterkills." I am talking now about personal friends; men whom I like; menwho are good citizens; who are honorable, upright, conscientious; butwhose idea of the Saviour's religion seems to me distorted. They lectureour shortcomings unsparingly, and every night they call us together andread to us chapters from the Testament that are full of gentleness, ofcharity, and of tender mercy; and then all the next day they stick totheir saddles clear up to the summits of these rugged mountains, andclear down again. Apply the Testament's gentleness, and charity, andtender mercy to a toiling, worn and weary horse?--Nonsense--these are forGod's human creatures, not His dumb ones. What the pilgrims choose todo, respect for their almost sacred character demands that I should allowto pass--but I would so like to catch any other member of the partyriding his horse up one of these exhausting hills once!
We have given the pilgrims a good many examples that might benefit them,but it is virtue thrown away. They have never heard a cross word out ofour lips toward each other--but they have quarreled once or twice. Welove to hear them at it, after they have been lecturing us. The veryfirst thing they did, coming ashore at Beirout, was to quarrel in theboat. I have said I like them, and I do like them--but every time theyread me a scorcher of a lecture I mean to talk back in print.
Not content with doubling the legitimate stages, they switched off themain road and went away out of the way to visit an absurd fountain calledFigia, because Baalam's ass had drank there once. So we journeyed on,through the terrible hills and deserts and the roasting sun, and then farinto the night, seeking the honored pool of Baalam's ass, the patronsaint of all pilgrims like us. I find no entry but this in my note-book:
 "Rode to-day, altogether, thirteen hours, through deserts, partly, and partly over barren, unsightly hills, and latterly through wild, rocky scenery, and camped at about eleven o'clock at night on the banks of a limpid stream, near a Syrian village. Do not know its name--do not wish to know it--want to go to bed. Two horses lame (mine and Jack's) and the others worn out. Jack and I walked three or four miles, over the hills, and led the horses. Fun--but of a mild type."
Twelve or thirteen hours in the saddle, even in a Christian land and aChristian climate, and on a good horse, is a tiresome journey; but in anoven like Syria, in a ragged spoon of a saddle that slips fore-and-aft,and "thort-ships," and every way, and on a horse that is tired and lame,and yet must be whipped and spurred with hardly a moment's cessation allday long, till the blood comes from his side, and your conscience hurtsyou every time you strike if you are half a man,--it is a journey to beremembered in bitterness of spirit and execrated with emphasis for aliberal division of a man's lifetime.
