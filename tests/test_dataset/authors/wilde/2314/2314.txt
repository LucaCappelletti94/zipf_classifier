PROFESSIONAL models are a purely modern invention. To the Greeks,for instance, they were quite unknown. Mr. Mahaffy, it is true,tells us that Pericles used to present peacocks to the great ladiesof Athenian society in order to induce them to sit to his friendPhidias, and we know that Polygnotus introduced into his picture ofthe Trojan women the face of Elpinice, the celebrated sister of thegreat Conservative leader of the day, but these GRANDES DAMESclearly do not come under our category. As for the old masters,they undoubtedly made constant studies from their pupils andapprentices, and even their religious pictures are full of theportraits of their friends and relations, but they do not seem tohave had the inestimable advantage of the existence of a class ofpeople whose sole profession is to pose. In fact the model, in oursense of the word, is the direct creation of Academic Schools.
Every country now has its own models, except America. In New York,and even in Boston, a good model is so great a rarity that most ofthe artists are reduced to painting Niagara and millionaires. InEurope, however, it is different. Here we have plenty of models,and of every nationality. The Italian models are the best. Thenatural grace of their attitudes, as well as the wonderfulpicturesqueness of their colouring, makes them facile - often toofacile - subjects for the painter's brush. The French models,though not so beautiful as the Italian, possess a quickness ofintellectual sympathy, a capacity, in fact, of understanding theartist, which is quite remarkable. They have also a great commandover the varieties of facial expression, are peculiarly dramatic,and can chatter the ARGOT of the ATELIER as cleverly as the criticof the GIL BLAS. The English models form a class entirely bythemselves. They are not so picturesque as the Italian, nor soclever as the French, and they have absolutely no tradition, so tospeak, of their order. Now and then some old veteran knocks at thestudio door, and proposes to sit as Ajax defying the lightning, oras King Lear upon the blasted heath. One of them some time agocalled on a popular painter who, happening at the moment to requirehis services, engaged him, and told him to begin by kneeling downin the attitude of prayer. 'Shall I be Biblical or Shakespearean,sir?' asked the veteran. 'Well - Shakespearean,' answered theartist, wondering by what subtle nuance of expression the modelwould convey the difference. 'All right, sir,' said the professorof posing, and he solemnly knelt down and began to wink with hisleft eye! This class, however, is dying out. As a rule the model,nowadays, is a pretty girl, from about twelve to twenty-five yearsof age, who knows nothing about art, cares less, and is merelyanxious to earn seven or eight shillings a day without muchtrouble. English models rarely look at a picture, and neverventure on any aesthetic theories. In fact, they realise verycompletely Mr. Whistler's idea of the function of an art critic,for they pass no criticisms at all. They accept all schools of artwith the grand catholicity of the auctioneer, and sit to afantastic young impressionist as readily as to a learned andlaborious academician. They are neither for the Whistlerites noragainst them; the quarrel between the school of facts and theschool of effects touches them not; idealistic and naturalistic arewords that convey no meaning to their ears; they merely desire thatthe studio shall be warm, and the lunch hot, for all charmingartists give their models lunch.
As to what they are asked to do they are equally indifferent. OnMonday they will don the rags of a beggar-girl for Mr. Pumper,whose pathetic pictures of modern life draw such tears from thepublic, and on Tuesday they will pose in a peplum for Mr. Phoebus,who thinks that all really artistic subjects are necessarily B.C.They career gaily through all centuries and through all costumes,and, like actors, are interesting only when they are notthemselves. They are extremely good-natured, and veryaccommodating. 'What do you sit for?' said a young artist to amodel who had sent him in her card (all models, by the way, havecards and a small black bag). 'Oh, for anything you like, sir,'said the girl, 'landscape if necessary!'
Intellectually, it must be acknowledged, they are Philistines, butphysically they are perfect - at least some are. Though none ofthem can talk Greek, many can look Greek, which to a nineteenth-century painter is naturally of great importance. If they areallowed, they chatter a great deal, but they never say anything.Their observations are the only BANALITES heard in Bohemia.However, though they cannot appreciate the artist as artist, theyare quite ready to appreciate the artist as a man. They are verysensitive to kindness, respect and generosity. A beautiful modelwho had sat for two years to one of our most distinguished Englishpainters, got engaged to a street vendor of penny ices.
On her marriage the painter sent her a pretty wedding present, andreceived in return a nice letter of thanks with the followingremarkable postscript: 'Never eat the green ices!'
When they are tired a wise artist gives them a rest. Then they sitin a chair and read penny dreadfuls, till they are roused from thetragedy of literature to take their place again in the tragedy ofart. A few of them smoke cigarettes. This, however, is regardedby the other models as showing a want of seriousness, and is notgenerally approved of. They are engaged by the day and by thehalf-day. The tariff is a shilling an hour, to which great artistsusually add an omnibus fare. The two best things about them aretheir extraordinary prettiness, and their extreme respectability.As a class they are very well behaved, particularly those who sitfor the figure, a fact which is curious or natural according to theview one takes of human nature. They usually marry well, andsometimes they marry the artist. For an artist to marry his modelis as fatal as for a GOURMET to marry his cook: the one gets nosittings, and the other gets no dinners.
On the whole the English female models are very naive, verynatural, and very good-humoured. The virtues which the artistvalues most in them are prettiness and punctuality. Every sensiblemodel consequently keeps a diary of her engagements, and dressesneatly. The bad season is, of course, the summer, when the artistsare out of town. However, of late years some artists have engagedtheir models to follow them, and the wife of one of our mostcharming painters has often had three or four models under hercharge in the country, so that the work of her husband and hisfriends should not be interrupted. In France the models migrate ENMASSE to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where thepainters congregate. The English models, however, wait patientlyin London, as a rule, till the artists come back. Nearly all ofthem live with their parents, and help to support the house. Theyhave every qualification for being immortalised in art except thatof beautiful hands. The hands of the English model are nearlyalways coarse and red.
As for the male models, there is the veteran whom we have mentionedabove. He has all the traditions of the grand style, and israpidly disappearing with the school he represents. An old man whotalks about Fuseli is, of course, unendurable, and, besides,patriarchs have ceased to be fashionable subjects. Then there isthe true Academy model. He is usually a man of thirty, rarelygood-looking, but a perfect miracle of muscles. In fact he is theapotheosis of anatomy, and is so conscious of his own splendourthat he tells you of his tibia and his thorax, as if no one elsehad anything of the kind. Then come the Oriental models. Thesupply of these is limited, but there are always about a dozen inLondon. They are very much sought after as they can remainimmobile for hours, and generally possess lovely costumes.However, they have a very poor opinion of English art, which theyregard as something between a vulgar personality and a commonplacephotograph. Next we have the Italian youth who has come overspecially to be a model, or takes to it when his organ is out ofrepair. He is often quite charming with his large melancholy eyes,his crisp hair, and his slim brown figure. It is true he eatsgarlic, but then he can stand like a faun and couch like a leopard,so he is forgiven. He is always full of pretty compliments, andhas been known to have kind words of encouragement for even ourgreatest artists. As for the English lad of the same age, he neversits at all. Apparently he does not regard the career of a modelas a serious profession. In any case he is rarely, if ever, to begot hold of. English boys, too, are difficult to find. Sometimesan ex-model who has a son will curl his hair, and wash his face,and bring him the round of the studios, all soap and shininess.The young school don't like him, but the older school do, and whenhe appears on the walls of the Royal Academy he is called THEINFANT SAMUEL. Occasionally also an artist catches a couple ofGAMINS in the gutter and asks them to come to his studio. Thefirst time they always appear, but after that they don't keep theirappointments. They dislike sitting still, and have a strong andperhaps natural objection to looking pathetic. Besides, they arealways under the impression that the artist is laughing at them.It is a sad fact, but there is no doubt that the poor arecompletely unconscious of their own picturesqueness. Those of themwho can be induced to sit do so with the idea that the artist ismerely a benevolent philanthropist who has chosen an eccentricmethod of distributing alms to the undeserving. Perhaps the SchoolBoard will teach the London GAMIN his own artistic value, and thenthey will be better models than they are now. One remarkableprivilege belongs to the Academy model, that of extorting asovereign from any newly elected Associate or R.A. They wait atBurlington House till the announcement is made, and then race tothe hapless artist's house. The one who arrives first receives themoney. They have of late been much troubled at the long distancesthey have had to run, and they look with disfavour on the electionof artists who live at Hampstead or at Bedford Park, for it isconsidered a point of honour not to employ the underground railway,omnibuses, or any artificial means of locomotion. The race is tothe swift.
Besides the professional posers of the studio there are posers ofthe Row, the posers at afternoon teas, the posers in politics andthe circus posers. All four classes are delightful, but only thelast class is ever really decorative. Acrobats and gymnasts cangive the young painter infinite suggestions, for they bring intotheir art an element of swiftness of motion and of constant changethat the studio model necessarily lacks. What is interesting inthese 'slaves of the ring' is that with them Beauty is anunconscious result not a conscious aim, the result in fact of themathematical calculation of curves and distances, of absoluteprecision of eye, of the scientific knowledge of the equilibrium offorces, and of perfect physical training. A good acrobat is alwaysgraceful, though grace is never his object; he is graceful becausehe does what he has to do in the best way in which it can be done -graceful because he is natural. If an ancient Greek were to cometo life now, which considering the probable severity of hiscriticisms would be rather trying to our conceit, he would be foundfar oftener at the circus than at the theatre. A good circus is anoasis of Hellenism in a world that reads too much to be wise, andthinks too much to be beautiful. If it were not for the running-ground at Eton, the towing-path at Oxford, the Thames swimming-baths, and the yearly circuses, humanity would forget the plasticperfection of its own form, and degenerate into a race of short-sighted professors and spectacled PRECIEUSES. Not that the circusproprietors are, as a rule, conscious of their high mission. Dothey not bore us with the HAUTE ECOLE, and weary us withShakespearean clowns? Still, at least, they give us acrobats, andthe acrobat is an artist. The mere fact that he never speaks tothe audience shows how well he appreciates the great truth that theaim of art is not to reveal personality but to please. The clownmay be blatant, but the acrobat is always beautiful. He is aninteresting combination of the spirit of Greek sculpture with thespangles of the modern costumier. He has even had his niche in thenovels of our age, and if MANETTE SALOMON be the unmasking of themodel, LES FRERES ZEMGANNO is the apotheosis of the acrobat.
As regards the influence of the ordinary model on our Englishschool of painting, it cannot be said that it is altogether good.It is, of course, an advantage for the young artist sitting in hisstudio to be able to isolate 'a little corner of life,' as theFrench say, from disturbing surroundings, and to study it undercertain effects of light and shade. But this very isolation leadsoften to mere mannerism in the painter, and robs him of that broadacceptance of the general facts of life which is the very essenceof art. Model-painting, in a word, while it may be the conditionof art, is not by any means its aim.
It is simply practice, not perfection. Its use trains the eye andthe hand of the painter, its abuse produces in his work an effectof mere posing and prettiness. It is the secret of much of theartificiality of modern art, this constant posing of pretty people,and when art becomes artificial it becomes monotonous. Outside thelittle world of the studio, with its draperies and its BRIC-E-BRAC,lies the world of life with its infinite, its Shakespeareanvariety. We must, however, distinguish between the two kinds ofmodels, those who sit for the figure and those who sit for thecostume. The study of the first is always excellent, but thecostume-model is becoming rather wearisome in modern pictures. Itis really of very little use to dress up a London girl in Greekdraperies and to paint her as a goddess. The robe may be the robeof Athens, but the face is usually the face of Brompton. Now andthen, it is true, one comes across a model whose face is anexquisite anachronism, and who looks lovely and natural in thedress of any century but her own. This, however, is rather rare.As a rule models are absolutely DE NOTRE SIECLE, and should bepainted as such. Unfortunately they are not, and, as aconsequence, we are shown every year a series of scenes from fancydress balls which are called historical pictures, but are littlemore than mediocre representations of modern people masquerading.In France they are wiser. The French painter uses the model simplyfor study; for the finished picture he goes direct to life.
However, we must not blame the sitters for the shortcomings of theartists. The English models are a well-behaved and hard-workingclass, and if they are more interested in artists than in art, alarge section of the public is in the same condition, and most ofour modern exhibitions seem to justify its choice.
