SCENE I
  An old park.  Early evening.  In the background a low Georgian  hall, which has been turned into offices for the Company, shows  windows already lighted.  GERALD and ANABEL walk along the path.
ANABEL.  How beautiful this old park is!
GERALD.  Yes, it is beautiful--seems so far away from everywhere, ifone doesn't remember that the hall is turned into offices.--No onehas lived here since I was a little boy.  I remember going to aChristmas party at the Walsalls'.
ANABEL.  Has it been shut up so long?
GERALD.  The Walsalls didn't like it--too near the ugliness.  Theywere county, you know--we never were: father never gave mother achance, there.  And besides, the place is damp, cellars full ofwater.
ANABEL.  Even now?
GERALD.  No, not now--they've been drained.  But the place would betoo damp for a dwelling-house.  It's all right as offices.  They burnenormous fires.  The rooms are quite charming.  This is what happensto the stately homes of England--they buzz with inky clerks, or theirequivalent.  Stateliness is on its last legs.
ANABEL.  Yes, it grieves me--though I should be bored if I had tobe stately, I think.--Isn't it beautiful in this light, like aneighteenth-century aquatint?  I'm sure no age was as ugly as this,since the world began.
GERALD.  For pure ugliness, certainly not.  And I believe none hasbeen so filthy to live in.--Let us sit down a minute, shall we? andwatch the rooks fly home.  It always stirs sad, sentimental feelingsin me.
ANABEL.  So it does in me.--Listen! one can hear the coal-carts onthe road--and the brook--and the dull noise of the town--and thebeating of New London pit--and voices--and the rooks--and yet it isso still.  We seem so still here, don't we?
GERALD.  Yes.
ANABEL.  Don't you think we've been wrong?
GERALD.  How?
ANABEL.  In the way we've lived--and the way we've loved.
GERALD.  It hasn't been heaven, has it?  Yet I don't know that we'vebeen wrong, Anabel.  We had it to go through.
ANABEL.  Perhaps.--And, yes, we've been wrong, too.
GERALD.  Probably.  Only, I don't feel it like that.
ANABEL.  Then I think you ought.  You ought to feel you've been wrong.
GERALD.  Yes, probably.  Only, I don't.  I can't help it.  I thinkwe've gone the way we had to go, following our own natures.
ANABEL.  And where has it landed us?
GERALD.  Here.
ANABEL.  And where is that?
GERALD.  Just on this bench in the park, looking at the evening.
ANABEL.  But what next?
GERALD.  God knows!  Why trouble?
ANABEL.  One must trouble.  I want to feel sure.
GERALD.  What of?
ANABEL.  Of you--and of myself.
GERALD.  Then BE sure.
ANABEL.  But I can't.  Think of the past--what it's been.
GERALD.  This isn't the past.
ANABEL.  But what is it?  Is there anything sure in it?  Is there anyreal happiness?
GERALD.  Why not?
ANABEL.  But how can you ask?  Think of what our life has been.
GERALD.  I don't want to.
ANABEL.  No, you don't.  But what DO you want?
GERALD.  I'm all right, you know, sitting here like this.
ANABEL.  But one can't sit here forever, can one?
GERALD.  I don't want to.
ANABEL.  And what will you do when we leave here?
GERALD.  God knows!  Don't worry me.  Be still a bit.
ANABEL.  But I'M worried.  You don't love me.
GERALD.  I won't argue it.
ANABEL.  And I'm not happy.
GERALD.  Why not, Anabel?
ANABEL.  Because you don't love me--and I can't forget.
GERALD.  I do love you--and to-night I've forgotten.
ANABEL.  Then make me forget, too.  Make me happy.
GERALD.  I CAN'T make you--and you know it.
ANABEL.  Yes, you can.  It's your business to make me happy.  I'vemade you happy.
GERALD.  You want to make me unhappy.
ANABEL.  I DO think you're the last word in selfishness.  If I sayI can't forget, you merely say, "I'VE forgotten"; and if I say I'munhappy, all YOU can answer is that I want to make YOU unhappy.  Idon't in the least.  I want to be happy myself.  But you don't helpme.
GERALD.  There is no help for it, you see.  If you WERE happy withme here you'd be happy.  As you aren't, nothing will make you--notgenuinely.
ANABEL.  And that's all you care.
GERALD.  No--I wish we could both be happy at the same moment.  Butapparently we can't.
ANABEL.  And why not?--Because you're selfish, and think of nothingbut yourself and your own feelings.
GERALD.  If it is so, it is so.
ANABEL.  Then we shall never be happy.
GERALD.  Then we sha'n't.  (A pause.)
ANABEL.  Then what are we going to do?
GERALD.  Do?
ANABEL.  Do you want me to be with you?
GERALD.  Yes.
ANABEL.  Are you sure?
GERALD.  Yes.
ANABEL.  Then why don't you want me to be happy?
GERALD.  If you'd only BE happy, here and now---
ANABEL.  How can I?
GERALD.  How can't you?--You've got a devil inside you.
ANABEL.  Then make me not have a devil.
GERALD.  I've know you long enough--and known myself long enough--toknow I can make you nothing at all, Anabel: neither can you make me.If the happiness isn't there--well, we shall have to wait for it,like a dispensation.  It probably means we shall have to hate eachother a little more.--I suppose hate is a real process.
ANABEL.  Yes, I know you believe more in hate than in love.
GERALD.  Nobody is more weary of hate than I am--and yet we can't fixour own hour, when we shall leave off hating and fighting.  It has towork itself out in us.
ANABEL.  But I don't WANT to hate and fight with you any more.  Idon't BELIEVE in it--not any more.
GERALD.  It's a cleansing process--like Aristotle's Katharsis.  Weshall hate ourselves clean at last, I suppose.
ANABEL.  Why aren't you clean now?  Why can't you love?  (He laughs.)DO you love me?
GERALD.  Yes.
ANABEL.  Do you want to be with me for ever?
GERALD.  Yes.
ANABEL.  Sure?
GERALD.  Quite sure.
ANABEL.  Why are you so cool about it?
GERALD.  I'm not.  I'm only sure--which you are not.
ANABEL.  Yes, I am--I WANT to be married to you.
GERALD.  I know you want me to want you to be married to me.  Butwhether off your own bat you have a positive desire that way, I'mnot sure.  You keep something back--some sort of female reservation--like a dagger up your sleeve.  You want to see me in transports oflove for you.
ANABEL.  How can you say so?  There--you see--there--this is the manthat pretends to love me, and then says I keep a dagger up my sleeve.You liar!
GERALD.  I do love you--and you do keep a dagger up your sleeve--somedevilish little female reservation which spies at me from a distance,in your soul, all the time, as if I were an enemy.
ANABEL.  How CAN you say so?--Doesn't it show what you must beyourself?  Doesn't it show?--What is there in your soul?
GERALD.  I don't know.
ANABEL.  Love, pure love?--Do you pretend it's love?
GERALD.  I'm so tired of this.
ANABEL.  So am I, dead tired: you self-deceiving, self complacentthing.  Ha!--aren't you just the same?  You haven't altered one scrapnot a scrap.
GERALD.  All right--you are always free to change yourself.
ANABEL.  I HAVE changed I AM better, I DO love you--I love you whollyand unselfishly--I do--and I want a good new life with you.
GERALD.  You're terribly wrapped up in your new goodness.  I wishyou'd make up your mind to be downright bad.
ANABEL.  Ha!--Do you?--You'd soon see.  You'd soon see where you'd beif---  There's somebody coming.  (Rises.)
GERALD.  Never mind; it's the clerks leaving work, I suppose.  Sitstill.
ANABEL.  Won't you go?
GERALD.  No.  (A man draws near, followed by another.)
CLERK.  Good evening, sir.  (Passes on.)  Good evening, Mr. Barlow.
ANABEL.  They are afraid.
GERALD.  I suppose their consciences are uneasy about this strike.
ANABEL.  Did you come to sit here just to catch them, like a spiderwaiting for them?
GERALD.  No.  I wanted to speak to Breffitt.
ANABEL.  I believe you're capable of any horridness.
GERALD.  All right, you believe it.  (Two more figures approach.)Good evening.
CLERKS.  Good night, sir.  (One passes, one stops.)  Good evening,Mr. Barlow.  Er--did you want to see Mr. Breffitt, sir?
GERALD.  Not particularly.
CLERK.  Oh!  He'll be out directly, sir--if you'd like me to go backand tell him you wanted him?
GERALD.  No, thank you.
CLERK.  Good night, sir.  Excuse me asking.
GERALD.  Good night.
ANABEL.  Who is Mr. Breffitt?
GERALD.  He is the chief clerk--and cashier--one of father's oldpillars of society.
ANABEL.  Don't you like him?
GERALD.  Not much.
ANABEL.  Why?--You seem to dislike very easily.
GERALD.  Oh, they all used to try to snub me, these old buffers.  Theydetest me like poison, because I am different from father.
ANABEL.  I believe you enjoy being detested.
GERALD.  I do.  (Another clerk approaches--hesitates--stops.)
CLERK.  Good evening, sir.  Good evening, Mr. Barlow.  Er--did youwant anybody at the office, sir?  We're just closing.
GERALD.  No, I didn't want anybody.
CLERK.  Oh, no, sir.  I see.  Er--by the way, sir--er--I hope youdon't think this--er--bother about an increase--this strike threat--started in the office?
GERALD.  Where did it start?
CLERK.  I should think it started--where it usually starts, Mr.Barlow--among a few loud-mouthed people who think they can do asthey like with the men.  They're only using the office men as a cry--They've no interest in us.  They want to show their power.--That'show it is, sir.
GERALD.  Oh, yes.
CLERK.  We're powerless, if they like to make a cry out of us.
GERALD.  Quite.
CLERK.  We're as much put out about it as anybody.
GERALD.  Of course.
CLERK.  Yes--well--good night, sir.  (Clerks draw near--there is asound of loud young voices and bicycle bells.  Bicycles sweep past.)
CLERKS.  Good night, sir.--Good night, sir.
GERALD.  Good night.--They're very bucked to see me sitting here witha woman--a young lady as they'll say.  I guess your name will beflying round to-morrow.  They stop partly to have a good look at you.Do they know you, do you think?
ANABEL.  Sure.
CLERKS.  Mr. Breffitt's just coming, sir.--Good night, sir.--Goodnight, sir.  (Another bicycle passes.)
ANABEL.  The bicycles don't see us.--Isn't it rather hateful to be amaster?  The attitude of them all is so ugly.  I can quite see thatit makes you rather a bully.
GERALD.  I suppose it does.  (Figure of a large man approaches.)
BREFFITT.  Oh--ah--it's Mr. Gerald!--I couldn't make out who it was.--Were you coming up to the office, sir?  Do you want me to go backwith you?
GERALD.  No, thank you--I just wanted a word with you about thisagitation.  It'll do just as well here.  It's a pity it started--that the office should have set it going, Breffitt.
BREFFITT.  It's none of the office's doing, I think you'll find, Mr.Gerald.  The office men did nothing but ask for a just advance--atany rate, time and prices being what they are, I consider it a fairadvance.  If the men took it up, it's because they've got a set ofloud-mouthed blatherers and agitators among them like Job ArthurFreer, who deserve to be hung--and hanging they'd get, if I couldhave the judging of them.
GERALD.  Well--it's very unfortunate--because we can't give the clerkstheir increase now, you know.
BREFFITT.  Can't you?--can't you?  I can't see that it would beanything out of the way, if I say what I think.
GERALD.  No.  They won't get any increase now.  It shouldn't have beenallowed to become a public cry with the colliers.  We can't give innow.
BREFFITT.  Have the Board decided that?
GERALD.  They have--on my advice.
BREFFITT.  Hm!--then the men will come out.
GERALD.  We will see.
BREFFITT.  It's trouble for nothing--it's trouble that could beavoided.  The clerks could have their advance, and it would hurtnobody.
GERALD.  Too late now.--I suppose if the men come out, the clerkswill come out with them?
BREFFITT.  They'll have to--they'll have to.
GERALD.  If they do, we may then make certain alterations in theoffice staff which have needed making for some time.
BREFFITT.  Very good--very good.  I know what you mean.--I don't knowhow your father bears all this, Mr. Gerald.
GERALD.  We keep it from him as much as possible.--You'll let theclerks know the decision.  And if they stay out with the men, I'llgo over the list of the staff with you.  It has needed revising fora long time.
BREFFITT.  I know what you mean--I know what you mean--I believe Iunderstand the firm's interest in my department.  I ought, afterforty years studying it.  I've studied the firm's interest for fortyyears, Mr. Gerald.  I'm not likely to forget them now.
GERALD.  Of course.
BREFFITT.  But I think it's a mistake--I think it's a mistake, andI'm bound to say it, to let a great deal of trouble rise for a verysmall cause.  The clerks might have had what they reasonably askedher.
GERALD.  Well, it's too late now.
BREFFITT.  I suppose it is--I suppose it is.  I hope you'll remember,sir, that I've put the interest of the firm before everything--beforeevery consideration.
GERALD.  Of course, Breffitt.
BREFFITT.  But you've not had any liking for the office staff, I'mafraid, sir--not since your father put you amongst us for a fewmonths.--Well, sir, we shall weather this gale, I hope, as we'veweathered those in the past.  Times don't become better, do they?Men are an ungrateful lot, and these agitators should be lynched.They would, if I had my way.
GERALD.  Yes, of course.  Don't wait.
BREFFITT.  Good night to you.  (Exit.)
GERALD.  Good night.
ANABEL.  He's the last, apparently.
GERALD.  We'll hope so.
ANABEL.  He puts you in a fury.
GERALD.	  It's his manner.  My father spoilt them--abominable oldlimpets.  And they're so self-righteous.  They think I'm a sort ofcriminal who has instigated this new devilish system which runseverything so close and cuts it so fine--as if they hadn't made thisinevitable by their shameless carelessness and wastefulness in thepast.  He may well boast of his forty years--forty years' crass,stupid wastefulness.
(Two or three more clerks pass, talking till they approach the seat,     then becoming silent after bidding good night.)
ANABEL.  But aren't you a bit sorry for them?
GERALD.  Why?  If they're poor, what does it matter in a world ofchaos?
ANABEL.  And aren't you an obstinate ass not to give them the bitthey want.  It's mere stupid obstinacy.
GERALD.  It may be.  I call it policy.
ANABEL.  Men always do call their obstinacy policy.
GERALD.  Well, I don't care what happens.  I wish things would cometo a head.  I only fear they won't.
ANABEL.  Aren't you rather wicked?--ASKING for strife?
GERALD.  I hope I am.  It's quite a relief to me to feel that I maybe wicked.  I fear I'm not.  I can see them all anticipating victory,in their low-down fashion wanting to crow their low-down crowings.I'm afraid I feel it's a righteous cause, to cut a lot of littlecombs before I die.
ANABEL.  But if they're right in what they want?
GERALD.  In the right--in the right!--They're just greedy, incompetent,stupid, gloating in a sense of the worst sort of power.  They're likevicious children, who would like to kill their parents so that theycould have the run of the larder.  The rest is just cant.
ANABEL.  If you're the parent in the case, I must say you flow overwith loving-kindness for them.
GERALD.  I don't--I detest them.  I only hope they will fight.  Ifthey would, I'd have some respect for them.  But you'll see what itwill be.
ANABEL.  I wish I needn't, for it's very sickening.
GERALD.  Sickening beyond expression.
ANABEL.  I wish we could go right away.
GERALD.  So do I--If one could get oneself out of this.  But onecan't.  It's the same wherever you have industrialism--and you haveindustrialism everywhere, whether it's in Timbuctoo or Paraguay orAntananarivo.
ANABEL.  No, it isn't: you exaggerate.
JOB ARTHUR  (suddenly approaching from the other side).  Good evening,Mr. Barlow.  I heard you were in here.  Could I have a word with you?
GERALD.  Get on with it, then.
JOB ARTHUR.  Is it right that you won't meet the clerks?
GERALD.  Yes.
JOB ARTHUR.  Not in any way?
GERALD.  Not in any way whatsoever.
JOB ARTHUR.  But--I thought I understood from you the other night---
GERALD.  It's all the same what you understood.
JOB ARTHUR.  Then you take it back, sir?
GERALD.  I take nothing back, because I gave nothing.
JOB ARTHUR.  Oh, excuse me, excuse me, sir.  You said it would be allright about the clerks.  This lady heard you say it.
GERALD.  Don't you call witnesses against me.--Besides, what does itmatter to you?  What in the name of---
JOB ARTHUR.  Well, sir, you said it would be all right, and I went onthat---
GERALD.  You went on that!  Where did you go to?
JOB ARTHUR.  The men'll be out on Monday.
GERALD.  So shall I.
JOB ARTHUR.  Oh, yes, but--where's it going to end?
GERALD.  Do you want me to prophesy?  When did I set up for a publicprophet?
JOB ARTHUR.  I don't know, sir.  But perhaps you're doing more thanyou know.  There's a funny feeling just now among the men.
GERALD.  So I've heard before.  Why should I concern myself withtheir feelings?  Am I to cry when every collier bumps his funny-bone--or to laugh?
JOB ARTHUR.  It's no laughing matter, you see.
GERALD.  An I'm sure it's no crying matter--unless you want to cry,do you see?
JOB ARTHUR.  Ah, but, very likely, it wouldn't be me would cry.--Youdon't know what might happen, now.
GERALD.  I'm waiting for something to happen.  I should like somethingto happen--very much--very much indeed.
JOB ARTHUR.  Yes, but perhaps you'd be sorry if it did happen.
GERALD.  Is that warning or a threat?
JOB ARTHUR.  I don't know--it might be a bit of both.  What I mean tosay---
GERALD (suddenly seizing him by the scruff of the neck and shakinghim).  What do you mean to say?--I mean you to say less, do you see?--a great deal less--do you see?  You've run on with your saying longenough: that clock had better run down.  So stop your sayings--stopyour sayings, I tell you--or you'll have them shaken out of you--shaken out of you--shaken out of you, do you see?  (Suddenly flingshim aside.)
(JOB ARTHUR, staggering, falls.)
ANABEL.  Oh, no!--oh, no!
GERALD.  Now get up, Job Arthur; and get up wiser than you went down.You've played your little game and your little tricks and made yourlittle sayings long enough.  You're going to stop now.  We've hadquite enough of strong men of your stamp, Job Arthur--quite enough--such labour leaders as you.
JOB ARTHUR.  You'll be sorry, Mr. Barlow--you'll be sorry.  You'llwish you'd not attacked me.
GERALD.  Don't you trouble about me and my sorrow.  Mind your own.
JOB ARTHUR.  You will--you'll be sorry.  You'll be sorry for whatyou've done.  You'll wish you'd never begun this.
GERALD.  Begun--begun?--I'd like to finish, too, that I would.  I'dlike to finish with you, too--I warn YOU.
JOB ARTHUR.  I warn you--I warn you.  You won't go on much longer.Every parish has its own vermin.
GERALD.  Vermin?
JOB ARTHUR.  Every parish has its own vermin; it lies with everyparish to destroy its own.  We sha'n't have a clean parish tillwe've destroyed the vermin we've got.
GERALD.  Vermin?  The fool's raving.  Vermin!--Another phrase-maker,by God!  Another phrase-maker to lead the people.--Vermin?  Whatvermin?  I know quite well what _I_ mean by vermin, Job Arthur.  Butwhat do you mean?  Vermin?  Explain yourself.
JOB ARTHUR.  Yes, vermin.  Vermin is what lives on other people'slives, living on their lives and profiting by it.  We've got 'em inevery parish--vermin, I say--that live on the sweat and blood of thepeople--live on it, and get rich on it--get rich through living onother people's lives, the lives of the working men--living on thebodies of the working men--that's vermin--if it isn't, what is it?And every parish must destroy its own--every parish must destroy itsown vermin.
GERALD.  The phrase, my God! the phrase.
JOB ARTHUR.  Phrase or not phrase, there it is, and face it out ifyou can.  There it is--there's not one in every parish--there's morethan one--there's a number---
GERALD (suddenly kicking him).  Go!  (Kicks him.)  Go!  (Kicks him.)go!  (JOB ARTHUR falls.)  Get out!  (Kicks him.)  Get out, I say!Get out, I tell you!  Get out!  Get out!--Vermin!--Vermin!--I'llvermin you!  I'll put my foot through your phrases.  Get up, I say,get up and go--GO!
JOB ARTHUR.  It'll be you as'll go, this time.
GERALD.  What?  What?--By God!  I'll kick you out of this park like arotten bundle if you don't get up and go.
ANABEL.  No, Gerald, no.  Don't forget yourself.  It's enough now.It's enough now.--Come away.  Do come away.  Come away--leave him---
JOB ARTHUR (still on the ground).  It's your turn to go.  It's youas'll go, this time.
GERALD (looking at him).  One can't even tread on you.
ANABEL.  Don't, Gerald, don't--don't look at him.--Don't say any more,you, Job Arthur.--Come away, Gerald.  Come away--come--do come.
GERALD (turning).  THAT a human being!  My God!--But he's right--it's I who go.  It's we who go, Anabel.  He's still there.--My God!a human being!
(Curtain.)
SCENE II
  Market-place as in Act I.  WILLIE HOUGHTON, addressing a large  crowd of men from the foot of the obelisk.
WILLIE.  And now you're out on strike--now you've been out for a weekpretty nearly, what further are you?  I heard a great deal of talkabout what you were going to do.  Well, what ARE you going to do?You don't know.  You've not the smallest idea.  You haven't any ideawhatsoever.  You've got your leaders.  Now then, Job Arthur, throw alittle light on the way in front, will you: for it seems to me we'relost in a bog.  Which way are we to steer?  Come--give the word, andlet's gee-up.
JOB ARTHUR.  You ask me which way we are to go.  I say we can't goour own way, because of the obstacles that lie in front.  You've gotto remove the obstacles from the way.
WILLIE.  So said Balaam's ass.  But you're not an ass--beg pardon;and you're not Balaam--you're Job.  And we've all got to be littleJobs, learning how to spell patience backwards.  We've lost our jobsand we've found a Job.  It's picking up a scorpion when you'relooking for an egg.--Tell us what you propose doing. . . . Remove anobstacle from the way!  What obstacle?  And whose way?
JOB ARTHUR.  I think it's pretty plain what the obstacle is.
WILLIE.  Oh, ay.  Tell us then.
JOB ARTHUR.  The obstacle to Labour is Capital.
WILLIE.  And how are we going to put salt on Capital's tail?
JOB ARTHUR.  By Labour we mean us working men; and by Capital we meanthose that derive benefit from us, take the cream off us and leave usthe skim.
WILLIE.  Oh, yes.
JOB ARTHUR.  So that, if you're going to remove the obstacle, you'vegot to remove the masters, and all that belongs to them.  Doeseverybody agree with me?
VOICES (loud).  Ah, we do--yes--we do that--we do an' a'--yi--yi--that's it!
WILLIE.  Agreed unanimously.  But how are we going to do it?  Do youpropose to send for Williamson's furniture van, to pack them in?  Ishould think one pantechnicon would do, just for this parish.  I'lldrive.  Who'll be the vanmen to list and carry?
JOB ARTHUR.  It's no use fooling.  You've fooled for thirty years, andwe're no further.  What's got to be done will have to be begun.  It'sfor every man to sweep in front of his own doorstep.  You can't callyour neighbours dirty till you've washed your own face.  Every parishhas got its own vermin, and it's the business of every parish to getrid of its own.
VOICES.  That's it--that's it--that's the ticket--that's the style!
WILLIE.  And are you going to comb 'em out, or do you propose to useKeating's?
VOICES.  Shut it!  Shut it up!  Stop thy face!  Hold thy gab!--Go on,Job Arthur.
JOB ARTHUR.  How it's got to be done is for us all to decide.  I'mnot one for violence, except it's a force-put.  But it's like this.We've been travelling for years to where we stand now--and here theroad stops.  There's a precipice below and a rock-face above.  Andin front of us stand the masters.  Now there's three things we cando.  We can either throw ourselves over the precipice; or we can liedown and let the masters walk over us; or we can GET ON.
WILLIE.  Yes.  That's all right.  But how are you going to get on?
JOB ARTHUR.  Well--we've either got to throw the obstacle down thecliff--or walk over it.
VOICES.  Ay--ay--ay--yes--that's a fact.
WILLIE.  I quite follow you, Job Arthur.  You've either got to do forthe masters--or else just remove them, and put them somewhere else.
VOICES.  Get rid on 'em--drop 'em down the shaft--sink 'em--ha' donewi' 'em--drop 'em down the shaft--bust the beggars--what do you dowi' vermin?
WILLIE.  Supposing you begin.  Supposing you take Gerald Barlow, andhang him up from his lamp-post, with a piece of coal in his mouth fora sacrament---
VOICES.  Ay--serve him right--serve the beggar right!  Shove it down'sthrottle--ay!
WILLIE.  Supposing you do it--supposing you've done it--and supposingyou aren't caught and punished--even supposing that--what are yougoing to do next?--THAT'S the point.
JOB ARTHUR.  We know what we're going to do.  Once we can get ourhands free, we know what we're going to do.
WILLIE.  Yes, so do I.  You're either going to make SUCH a mess thatwe shall never get out of it--which I don't think you will do, forthe English working man is the soul of obedience and order, and he'dbehave himself to-morrow as if he was at Sunday school, no matterwhat he does to-day.--No, what you'll do, Job Arthur, you'll setup another lot of masters, such a jolly sight worse than what we'vegot now.  I'd rather be mastered by Gerald Barlow, if it comes tomastering, than by Job Arthur Freer--oh, SUCH a lot!  You'll be farless free with Job Arthur for your boss than ever you were withGerald Barlow.  You'll be far more degraded.--In fact, though I'vepreached socialism in the market-place for thirty years--if you'regoing to start killing the masters to set yourselves up as bosses--why, kill me along with the masters.  For I'd rather die withsomebody who has one tiny little spark of decency left--though itIS a little tiny spark--than live to triumph with those that havenone.
VOICES.  Shut thy face, Houghton--shut it up--shut him up--hustle thebeggar!  Hoi!--hoi-ee!--whoo!--whoam-it, whoam-it!--whoo!--bow-wow!--wet-whiskers!---
WILLIE.  And it's no use you making fool of yourselves---  (His wordsare heard through an ugly, jeering, cold commotion.)
VOICE (loudly).  He's comin'.
VOICES.  Who?
VOICE.  Barlow.--See 's motor?--comin' up--sithee?
WILLIE.  If you've any sense left---  (Suddenly and violentlydisappears.)
VOICES.  Sorry!--he's comin'--'s comin'--sorry, ah!  Who's in?--That's Turton drivin'--yi, he's behind wi' a woman--ah, he's comin'--he'll none go back--hold on.  Sorry!--wheer's 'e comin'?--up fromLoddo--ay---  (The cries die down--the motor car slowly comes intosight, OLIVER driving, GERALD and ANABEL behind.  The men stand ina mass in the way.)
OLIVER.  Mind yourself, there.  (Laughter.)
GERALD.  Go ahead, Oliver.
VOICE.  What's yer 'urry?
(Crowd sways and surges on the car.  OLIVER is suddenly dragged out.     GERALD stands up--he, too, is seized from behind--he wrestles--is     torn out of his greatcoat--then falls--disappears.  Loud cries--     "Hi!--hoi!--hoiee!"--all the while.  The car shakes and presses     uneasily.)
VOICE.  Stop the blazin' motor, somebody.
VOICE.  Here y' are!--hold a minute.  (A man jumps in and stops theengine--he drops in the driver's seat.)
COLLIER (outside the car).  Step down, miss.
ANABEL.  I am Mrs. Barlow.
COLLIER.  Missis, then.  (Laugh.)  Step done--lead 'er forrard.  Take'em forrard.
JOB ARTHUR.  Ay, make a road.
GERALD.  You're makin' a proper fool of yourself now, Freer.
JOB ARTHUR.  You've brought it on yourself.  YOU'VE made fools ofplenty of men.
COLLIERS.  Come on, now--come on!  Whoa!--whoa!--he's a jibber--gopretty now, go pretty!
VOICES (suddenly).  Lay hold o' Houghton--nab 'im--seize 'im--rats!--rats!--bring 'im forrard!
ANABEL (in a loud, clear voice).  I never knew anything so RIDICULOUS.
VOICES (falsetto).  Ridiculous!  Oh, ridiculous!  Mind the step, dear!--I'm Mrs. Barlow!--Oh, are you?--Tweet--tweet!
JOB ARTHUR.  Make a space, boys, make a space, boys, make a space.(He stands with prisoners in a cleared space before the obelisk.)Now--now--quiet a minute--we want to ask a few questions of thesegentlemen.
VOICES.  Quiet!--quiet!--Sh-h-h!  Sh-h-h!--Answer pretty--answerpretty now!--Quiet!--Shh-h-h!
JOB ARTHUR.  We want to ask you, Mr. Gerald Barlow, why you havegiven occasion for this present trouble.
GERALD.  You are a fool.
VOICES.  Oh!--oh!--naughty Barlow!--naughty baa-lamb--answer pretty--be good baa-lamb--baa--baa!--answer pretty when gentleman asks you.
JOB ARTHUR.  Quiet a bit  Sh-h-h!--We put this plain question to you,Mr. Barlow.  Why did you refuse to give the clerks this just and fairadvance, when you knew that by refusing you would throw three thousandmen out of employment?
GERALD.  You are a fool, I say.
VOICES.  Oh!--oh!--won't do--won't do, Barlow--wrong answer--wronganswer--be good baa-lamb--naughty boy--naughty boy!
JOB ARTHUR.  Quiet a bit now!--If three thousand men ask you a just,straightforward question, do you consider they've no right to ananswer?
GERALD.  I would answer you with my foot.
VOICES (amid a threatening scuffle).  Da-di-da!  Hark ye--hark ye!Oh--whoa--whoa a bit!--won't do!--won't do!--naughty--naughty--sayyou're sorry--say you're sorry--kneel and say you're sorry--kneeland beg pardon!
JOB ARTHUR.  Hold on a bit--keep clear!
VOICES.  Make him kneel--make him kneel--on his knees with him!
JOB ARTHUR.  I think you'd better kneel down.
(The crowd press on GERALD--he struggles--they hit him behind the     knees, force him down.)
OLIVER.  This is shameful and unnecessary.
VOICES.  All of 'em--on your knees--all of' em--on their knees!
(The seize OLIVER and WILLIE and ANABEL, hustling.  ANABEL kneels     quietly--the others struggle.)
WILLIE.  Well, of all the damned, dirty, cowardly---
VOICES.  Shut up, Houghton--shut him up--squeeze him!
OLIVER.  Get off me--let me alone--I'll kneel.
VOICES.  Good little doggies--nice doggies--kneel and beg pardon--yap-yap--answer--make him answer!
JOB ARTHUR (holding up his hand for silence).  It would be better ifyou answered straight off, Barlow.  We want to know why you preventedthat advance.
VOICES (after a pause).  Nip his neck!  Make him yelp!
OLIVER.  Let me answer, then.--Because it's worse, perhaps, to bebullied by three thousand men than by one man.
VOICES.  Oh!--oh!--dog keeps barking--stuff his mouth--stop him up--here's a bit of paper--answer, Barlow--nip his neck--stuff his mug--make him yelp--cork the bottle!
(They press a lump of newspaper into OLIVER'S mouth, and bear down on     GERALD.)
JOB ARTHUR.  Quiet--quiet--quiet a minute, everybody.  We give him aminute--we give him a minute to answer.
VOICES.  Give him a minute--a holy minute--say your prayers, Barlow--you've got a minute--tick-tick, says the clock--time him!
JOB ARTHUR.  Keep quiet.
WILLIE.  Of all the damned, cowardly---
VOICES. Sh-h-h!--Squeeze him--throttle him!  Silence is golden,Houghton.--Close the shutters, Willie's dead.--Dry up, wet whiskers!
JOB ARTHUR.  You've fifteen seconds.
VOICES.  There's a long, long trail a-winding---
JOB ARTHUR.  The minute's up.--We ask you again, Gerald Barlow, whyyou refused a just and fair demand, when you know it was against thewishes of three thousand men all as good as yourself.
VOICES.  And a sight better--I don't think--we're not all vermin--we're not all crawlers, living off the sweat of other folks--we'renot all parish vermin--parish vermin.
JOB ARTHUR.  And on what grounds do you think you have no occasion toanswer the straightforward question we put you here?
ANABEL (after a pause).  Answer them, Gerald.  What's the use ofprolonging this?
GERALD.  I've nothing to answer.
VOICES.  Nothing to answer--Gerald, darling--Gerald, duckie--oh,lovey-dovey--I've nothing to answer--no, by God--no, by God, hehasna--nowt to answer--ma'e him find summat, then--answer for him--gi'e him's answer--let him ha'e it--go on--mum--mum--lovey-dovey--rub his nose in it--kiss the dirt, ducky--bend him down--rub hisnose in--he's saying something--oh, no, he isn't--sorry I spoke--bend him down!
JOB ARTHUR.  Quiet a bit--quiet everybody--he's got to answer--keepquiet.--Now---  (A silence.)  Now then, Barlow, will you answer, orwon't you?  (Silence.)
ANABEL.  Answer them, Gerald--never mind.
VOICES.  Sh-h-h!  Sh-h-h!  (Silence.)
JOB ARTHUR.  You won't answer, Barlow?
VOICE.  Down the beggar!
VOICES.  Down him--put his nose down--flatten him!
(The crowd surges and begins to howl--they sway dangerously--GERALD     is spread-eagled on the floor, face down.)
JOB ARTHUR.  Back--back--back a minute--back--back!  (They recoil.)
WILLIE.  I HOPE there's a God in heaven.
VOICES.  Put him down--flatten him!
(WILLIE is flattened on the ground.)
JOB ARTHUR.  Now, then--now then--if you won't answer, Barlow, Ican't stand here for you any more.--Take your feet off him, boys,and turn him over--let us look at him.  Let us see if he CAN speak.(They turn him over, with another scuffle.)  Now then, Barlow--youcan see the sky above you.  Now do you think you're going to playwith three thousand men, with their lives and with their souls?--now do you think you're going to answer them with your foot?--doyou--do you?
(The crowd has begun to sway and heave dangerously, with a low,     muffled roar, above which is heard JOB ARTHUR'S voice.  As he     ceases, the roar breaks into a yell--the crowd heaves.)
VOICES.  Down him--crack the vermin--on top of him--put your foot onthe vermin!
ANABEL (with a loud, piercing cry, suddenly starting up).  Ah, no!Ah, no!  Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o!  Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o!  Ah-h-h-h no-o-o-o!No-o-o-o!  No-o-o-o!  No-o!  No-o-o!--Ah-h-h-h!--it's  enough,  it'senough,  it's  enough--he's a man as you are.  He's a man as you are.He's a man as you are.  (Weeps--a breath of silence.)
OLIVER.  Let us stop now--let us stop now.  Let me stand up.(Silence.)  I want to stand up.  (A muffled noise.)
VOICE.  Let him get up.  (OLIVER rises.)
OLIVER.  Be quiet.  Be quiet.--Now--choose!  Choose!  Choose!  Choosewhat you will do!  Only choose!  Choose!--it will be irrevocable.  (Amoment's pause.)  Thank God we haven't gone too far.--Gerald, get up.(Men still hold him down.)
JOB ARTHUR.  Isn't he to answer us?  Isn't he going to answer us?
OLIVER.  Yes, he shall answer you.  He shall answer you.  But lethim stand up.  No more of this.  Let him stand up.  He must standup.  (Men still hold GERALD down.)  OLIVER takes hold of theirhands and removes them.)  Let go--let go now.  Yes, let go--yes--Iask you to let go.  (Slowly, sullenly, the men let go.  GERALD isfree, but he does not move.)  There--get up, Gerald!  Get up!  Youaren't hurt, are you?  You must get up--it's no use.  We're doingour best--you must do yours.  When things are like this, we haveto put up with what we get.  (GERALD rises slowly and faces themob.  They roar dully.)  You ask why the clerks didn't get thisincrease?  Wait!  Wait!  Do you still wish for any answer, Mr.Freer?
JOB ARTHUR.  Yes, that's what we've been waiting for.
OLIVER.  Then answer, Gerald.
GERALD.  They've trodden on my face.
OLIVER.  No matter.  Job Arthur will easily answer that you'vetrodden on their souls.  Don't start an altercation.  (The crowd isbeginning to roar.)
GERALD.  You want to know why the clerks didn't get their rise?--Because you interfered and attempted to bully about it, do you see.That's why.
VOICES.  You want bullying.--You'll get bullying, you will.
OLIVER.  Can't you see it's no good, either side?  It's no mortaluse.  We might as well all die to-morrow, or to-day, or this minute,as go on bullying one another, one side bullying the other side, andthe other side bullying back.  We'd BETTER all die.
WILLIE.  And a great deal better.  I'm damned if I'll take sideswith anybody against anything, after this.  If I'm to die, I'lldie by myself.  As for living, it seems impossible.
JOB ARTHUR.  Have the men nothing to be said for their side?
OLIVER.  They have a great deal--but not EVERYTHING, you see.
JOB ARTHUR.  Haven't they been wronged?  And AREN'T they wronged?
OLIVER.  They have--and they are.  But haven't they been wrongthemselves, too?--and aren't they wrong now?
JOB ARTHUR.  How?
OLIVER.  What about this affair?  Do you call it right?
JOB ARTHUR.  Haven't we been driven to it?
OLIVER.  Partly.  And haven't you driven the masters to it, as well?
JOB ARTHUR.  I don't see that.
OLIVER.  Can't you see that it takes two to make a quarrel?  And aslong as each party hangs on to its own end of the stick and strugglesto get full hold of the stick, the quarrel will continue.  It willcontinue till you've killed one another.  And even then, what bettershall you be?  What better would you be, really, if you'd killedGerald Barlow just now?  You wouldn't, you know.  We're all humanbeings, after all.  And why can't we try really to leave offstruggling against one another, and set up a new state of things?
JOB ARTHUR.  That's all very well, you see, while you've got thegoods.
OLIVER.  I've got very little, I assure you.
JOB ARTHUR.  Well, if you haven't, those you mix with have.  They'vegot the money, and the power, and they intend to keep it.
OLIVER.  As for power, somebody must have it, you know.  It only restswith you to put it into the hands of the best men, the men you REALLYbelieve in.--And as for money, it's life, it's living that matters,not simply having money.
JOB ARTHUR.  You can't live without money.
OLIVER.  I know that.  And therefore why can't we have the decency toagree simply about money--just agree to dispose of it so that all mencould live their own lives.
JOB ARTHUR.  That's what we want to do.  But the others, such asGerald Barlow, they keep the money--AND the power.
OLIVER.  You see, if you wanted to arrage things so that money flowedmore naturally, so that it flowed naturally to every man, accordingto his needs, I think we could all soon agree.  But you don't.  Whatyou want is to take it away from one set and give it to another--orkeep it yourselves.
JOB ARTHUR.  We want every man to have his proper share.
OLIVER.  I'm sure _I_ do.  I want every man to be able to live andbe free.  But we shall never manage it by fighting over the money.If you want what is natural and good, I'm sure the owners would soonagree with you.
JOB ARTHUR.  What?  Gerald Barlow agree with us?
OLIVER.  Why not?  I believe so.
JOB ARTHUR.  You ask him.
OLIVER.  Do you think, Gerald, that if the men really wanted a whole,better way, you would agree with them?
GERALD.  I want a better way myself--but not their way.
JOB ARTHUR.  There, you see!
VOICES.  Ah-h! look you!--That's him--that's him all over.
OLIVER.  You want a better way,--but not his way: he wants a betterway--but not your way.  Why can't you both drop your buts, and simplysay you want a better way, and believe yourselves and one anotherwhen you say it?  Why can't you?
GERALD.  Look here!  I'm quite as tired of my way of life as you areof yours.  If you make me believe you want something better, then Iassure you I do:  I want what you want.  But Job Arthur Freer's notthe man to lead you to anything better.  You can tell what peoplewant by the leaders they choose, do you see?  You choose leaderswhom I respect, and I'll respect you, do you see?  As it is, I don't.And now I'm going.
VOICES.  Who says?--Oh ay!--Who says goin'?
GERALD.  Yes, I'm going.  About this affair here we'll cry quits; nomore said about it.  About a new way of life, a better way all round--I tell you I want it and need it as much as ever you do.  I don't careabout money really.  But I'm never going to be bullied.
VOICE.  Who doesn't care about money?
GERALD.  I don't.  I think we ought to be able to alter the wholesystem--but not by bullying, not because one lot wants what the otherhas got.
VOICE.  No, because you've got everything.
GERALD.  Where's my coat?  Now then, step out of the way.  (They movetowards the car.)
(Curtain.)
