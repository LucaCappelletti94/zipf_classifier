Every one is a moon, and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
When I scribbled in my note-book a year ago the paragraph which ends thepreceding chapter, it was meant to indicate, in an extravagant form, twothings: the conflicting nature of the information conveyed by the citizento the stranger concerning South African politics, and the resultingconfusion created in the stranger's mind thereby.
But it does not seem so very extravagant now. Nothing could in thatdisturbed and excited time make South African politics clear or quiterational to the citizen of the country because his personal interest andhis political prejudices were in his way; and nothing could make thosepolitics clear or rational to the stranger, the sources of hisinformation being such as they were.
I was in South Africa some little time. When I arrived there thepolitical pot was boiling fiercely. Four months previously, Jameson hadplunged over the Transvaal border with about 600 armed horsemen at hisback, to go to the "relief of the women and children" of Johannesburg; onthe fourth day of his march the Boers had defeated him in battle, andcarried him and his men to Pretoria, the capital, as prisoners; the Boergovernment had turned Jameson and his officers over to the Britishgovernment for trial, and shipped them to England; next, it had arrested64 important citizens of Johannesburg as raid-conspirators, condemnedtheir four leaders to death, then commuted the sentences, and now the 64were waiting, in jail, for further results. Before midsummer they wereall out excepting two, who refused to sign the petitions for release; 58had been fined $10,000 each and enlarged, and the four leaders had gottenoff with fines of $125,000 each with permanent exile added, in one case.
Those were wonderfully interesting days for a stranger, and I was glad.to be in the thick of the excitement. Everybody was talking, and Iexpected to understand the whole of one side of it in a very littlewhile.
I was disappointed. There were singularities, perplexities,unaccountabilities about it which I was not able to master. I had nopersonal access to Boers--their side was a secret to me, aside from whatI was able to gather of it from published statements. My sympathies weresoon with the Reformers in the Pretoria jail, with their friends, andwith their cause. By diligent inquiry in Johannesburg I found out--apparently--all the details of their side of the quarrel except one--whatthey expected to accomplish by an armed rising.
Nobody seemed to know.
The reason why the Reformers were discontented and wanted some changesmade, seemed quite clear. In Johannesburg it was claimed that theUitlanders (strangers, foreigners) paid thirteen-fifteenths of theTransvaal taxes, yet got little or nothing for it. Their city had nocharter; it had no municipal government; it could levy no taxes fordrainage, water-supply, paving, cleaning, sanitation, policing. Therewas a police force, but it was composed of Boers, it was furnished by theState Government, and the city had no control over it. Mining was verycostly; the government enormously increased the cost by puttingburdensome taxes upon the mines, the output, the machinery, thebuildings; by burdensome imposts upon incoming materials; by burdensomerailway-freight-charges. Hardest of all to bear, the government reservedto itself a monopoly in that essential thing, dynamite, and burdened itwith an extravagant price. The detested Hollander from over the waterheld all the public offices. The government was rank with corruption.The Uitlander had no vote, and must live in the State ten or twelve yearsbefore he could get one. He was not represented in the Raad(legislature) that oppressed him and fleeced him. Religion was not free.There were no schools where the teaching was in English, yet the greatmajority of the white population of the State knew no tongue but that.The State would not pass a liquor law; but allowed a great trade in cheapvile brandy among the blacks, with the result that 25 per cent. of the50,000 blacks employed in the mines were usually drunk and incapable ofworking.
There--it was plain enough that the reasons for wanting some changes madewere abundant and reasonable, if this statement of the existinggrievances was correct.
What the Uitlanders wanted was reform--under the existing Republic.
What they proposed to do was to secure these reforms by, prayer,petition, and persuasion.
They did petition. Also, they issued a Manifesto, whose very first noteis a bugle-blast of loyalty: "We want the establishment of this Republicas a true Republic."
Could anything be clearer than the Uitlander's statement of thegrievances and oppressions under which they were suffering? Couldanything be more legal and citizen-like and law-respecting than theirattitude as expressed by their Manifesto? No. Those things wereperfectly clear, perfectly comprehensible.
But at this point the puzzles and riddles and confusions begin to flockin. You have arrived at a place which you cannot quite understand.
For you find that as a preparation for this loyal, lawful, and in everyway unexceptionable attempt to persuade the government to right theirgrievances, the Uitlanders had smuggled a Maxim gun or two and 1,500muskets into the town, concealed in oil tanks and coal cars, and hadbegun to form and drill military companies composed of clerks, merchants,and citizens generally.
What was their idea? Did they suppose that the Boers would attack themfor petitioning, for redress? That could not be.
Did they suppose that the Boers would attack them even for issuing aManifesto demanding relief under the existing government?
Yes, they apparently believed so, because the air was full of talk offorcing the government to grant redress if it were not grantedpeacefully.
The Reformers were men of high intelligence. If they were in earnest,they were taking extraordinary risks. They had enormously valuableproperties to defend; their town was full of women and children; theirmines and compounds were packed with thousands upon thousands of sturdyblacks. If the Boers attacked, the mines would close, the blacks wouldswarm out and get drunk; riot and conflagration and the Boers togethermight lose the Reformers more in a day, in money, blood, and suffering,than the desired political relief could compensate in ten years if theywon the fight and secured the reforms.
It is May, 1897, now; a year has gone by, and the confusions of that dayhave been to a considerable degree cleared away. Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Dr.Jameson, and others responsible for the Raid, have testified before theParliamentary Committee of Inquiry in London, and so have Mr. LionelPhillips and other Johannesburg Reformers, monthly-nurses of theRevolution which was born dead. These testimonies have thrown light.Three books have added much to this light:
"South Africa As It Is," by Mr. Statham, an able writer partial to theBoers; "The Story of an African Crisis," by Mr. Garrett, a brilliantwriter partial to Rhodes; and "A Woman's Part in a Revolution," by Mrs.John Hays Hammond, a vigorous and vivid diarist, partial to theReformers. By liquifying the evidence of the prejudiced books and of theprejudiced parliamentary witnesses and stirring the whole together andpouring it into my own (prejudiced) moulds, I have got at the truth ofthat puzzling South African situation, which is this:
1. The capitalists and other chief men of Johannesburg were frettingunder various political and financial burdens imposed by the State (theSouth African Republic, sometimes called "the Transvaal") and desired toprocure by peaceful means a modification of the laws.
2. Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Premier of the British Cape Colony, millionaire,creator and managing director of the territorially-immense andfinancially unproductive South Africa Company; projector of vast schemesfor the unification and consolidation of all the South African States,one imposing commonwealth or empire under the shadow and generalprotection of the British flag, thought he saw an opportunity to makeprofitable use of the Uitlander discontent above mentioned--make theJohannesburg cat help pull out one of his consolidation chestnuts forhim. With this view he set himself the task of warming the lawful andlegitimate petitions and supplications of the Uitlanders into seditioustalk, and their frettings into threatenings--the final outcome to berevolt and armed rebellion. If he could bring about a bloody collisionbetween those people and the Boer government, Great Britain would have tointerfere; her interference would be resisted by the Boers; she wouldchastise them and add the Transvaal to her South African possessions. Itwas not a foolish idea, but a rational and practical one.
After a couple of years of judicious plotting, Mr. Rhodes had his reward;the revolutionary kettle was briskly boiling in Johannesburg, and theUitlander leaders were backing their appeals to the government--nowhardened into demands--by threats of force and bloodshed. By the middleof December, 1895, the explosion seemed imminent. Mr. Rhodes wasdiligently helping, from his distant post in Cape Town. He was helpingto procure arms for Johannesburg; he was also arranging to have Jamesonbreak over the border and come to Johannesburg with 600 mounted men athis back. Jameson--as per instructions from Rhodes, perhaps--wanted aletter from the Reformers requesting him to come to their aid. It was agood idea. It would throw a considerable share of the responsibility ofhis invasion upon the Reformers. He got the letter--that famous oneurging him to fly to the rescue of the women and children. He got it twomonths before he flew. The Reformers seem to have thought it over andconcluded that they had not done wisely; for the next day after givingJameson the implicating document they wanted to withdraw it and leave thewomen and children in danger; but they were told that it was too late.The original had gone to Mr. Rhodes at the Cape. Jameson had kept acopy, though.
From that time until the 29th of December, a good deal of the Reformers'time was taken up with energetic efforts to keep Jameson from coming totheir assistance. Jameson's invasion had been set for the 26th. TheReformers were not ready. The town was not united. Some wanted a fight,some wanted peace; some wanted a new government, some wanted the existingone reformed; apparently very few wanted the revolution to take place inthe interest and under the ultimate shelter of the Imperial flag--British; yet a report began to spread that Mr. Rhodes's embarrassingassistance had for its end this latter object.
Jameson was away up on the frontier tugging at his leash, fretting toburst over the border. By hard work the Reformers got his starting-datepostponed a little, and wanted to get it postponed eleven days.Apparently, Rhodes's agents were seconding their efforts--in fact wearingout the telegraph wires trying to hold him back. Rhodes was himself theonly man who could have effectively postponed Jameson, but that wouldhave been a disadvantage to his scheme; indeed, it could spoil his wholetwo years' work.
Jameson endured postponement three days, then resolved to wait no longer.Without any orders--excepting Mr. Rhodes's significant silence--he cutthe telegraph wires on the 29th, and made his plunge that night, to go tothe rescue of the women and children, by urgent request of a letter nownine days old--as per date,--a couple of months old, in fact. He readthe letter to his men, and it affected them. It did not affect all ofthem alike. Some saw in it a piece of piracy of doubtful wisdom, andwere sorry to find that they had been assembled to violate friendlyterritory instead of to raid native kraals, as they had supposed.
Jameson would have to ride 150 miles. He knew that there were suspicionsabroad in the Transvaal concerning him, but he expected to get through toJohannesburg before they should become general and obstructive. But atelegraph wire had been overlooked and not cut. It spread the news ofhis invasion far and wide, and a few hours after his start the Boerfarmers were riding hard from every direction to intercept him.
As soon as it was known in Johannesburg that he was on his way to rescuethe women and children, the grateful people put the women and children ina train and rushed them for Australia. In fact, the approach ofJohannesburg's saviour created panic and consternation; there, and amultitude of males of peaceable disposition swept to the trains like asand-storm. The early ones fared best; they secured seats--by sitting inthem--eight hours before the first train was timed to leave.
Mr. Rhodes lost no time. He cabled the renowned Johannesburg letter ofinvitation to the London press--the gray-headedest piece of ancienthistory that ever went over a cable.
The new poet laureate lost no time. He came out with a rousing poemlauding Jameson's prompt and splendid heroism in flying to the rescue ofthe women and children; for the poet could not know that he did not flyuntil two months after the invitation. He was deceived by the false dateof the letter, which was December 20th.
Jameson was intercepted by the Boers on New Year's Day, and on the nextday he surrendered. He had carried his copy of the letter along, and ifhis instructions required him--in case of emergency--to see that it fellinto the hands of the Boers, he loyally carried them out. Mrs. Hammondgives him a sharp rap for his supposed carelessness, and emphasizes herfeeling about it with burning italics: "It was picked up on thebattle-field in a leathern pouch, supposed to be Dr. Jameson's saddle-bag.Why, in the name of all that is discreet and honorable, didn't he eat it!"
She requires too much. He was not in the service of the Reformers--excepting ostensibly; he was in the service of Mr. Rhodes. It was theonly plain English document, undarkened by ciphers and mysteries, andresponsibly signed and authenticated, which squarely implicated theReformers in the raid, and it was not to Mr. Rhodes's interest that itshould be eaten. Besides, that letter was not the original, it was onlya copy. Mr. Rhodes had the original--and didn't eat it. He cabled it tothe London press. It had already been read in England and America andall over Europe before, Jameson dropped it on the battlefield. If thesubordinate's knuckles deserved a rap, the principal's deserved as manyas a couple of them.
That letter is a juicily dramatic incident and is entitled to all itscelebrity, because of the odd and variegated effects which it produced.All within the space of a single week it had made Jameson an illustrioushero in England, a pirate in Pretoria, and an ass without discretion orhonor in Johannesburg; also it had produced a poet-laureatic explosion ofcolored fireworks which filled the world's sky with giddy splendors, and,the knowledge that Jameson was coming with it to rescue the women andchildren emptied Johannesburg of that detail of the population. For anold letter, this was much. For a letter two months old, it did marvels;if it had been a year old it would have done miracles.
