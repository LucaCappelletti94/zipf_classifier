The Rest of the Equipment
The author of the Plays was equipped, beyond every other man of histime, with wisdom, erudition, imagination, capaciousness of mind,grace and majesty of expression. Every one has said it, no onedoubts it. Also, he had humor, humor in rich abundance, and alwayswanting to break out. We have no evidence of any kind thatShakespeare of Stratford possessed any of these gifts or any ofthese acquirements. The only lines he ever wrote, so far as weknow, are substantially barren of them--barren of all of them.
Good friend for Iesus sake forbeareTo digg the dust encloased heare:Blest be ye man yt spares thes stonesAnd curst be he yt moves my bones.
Ben Jonson says of Bacon, as orator:
His language, WHERE HE COULD SPARE AND PASS BY A JEST, was noblycensorious. No man ever spoke more neatly, more pressly, moreweightily, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in what heuttered. No member of his speech but consisted of his (its) owngraces . . . The fear of every man that heard him was lest heshould make an end.
From Macaulay:
He continued to distinguish himself in Parliament, particularly byhis exertions in favor of one excellent measure on which the King'sheart was set--the union of England and Scotland. It was notdifficult for such an intellect to discover many irresistiblearguments in favor of such a scheme. He conducted the great caseof the Post Nati in the Exchequer Chamber; and the decision of thejudges--a decision the legality of which may be questioned, but thebeneficial effect of which must be acknowledged--was in a greatmeasure attributed to his dexterous management.
Again:
While actively engaged in the House of Commons and in the courts oflaw, he still found leisure for letters and philosophy. The nobletreatise on the Advancement of Learning, which at a later periodwas expanded into the De Augmentis, appeared in 1605
The Wisdom of the Ancients, a work which if it had proceeded fromany other writer would have been considered as a masterpiece of witand learning, was printed in 1609.
In the meantime the Novum Organum was slowly proceeding. Severaldistinguished men of learning had been permitted to see portions ofthat extraordinary book, and they spoke with the greatestadmiration of his genius.
Even Sir Thomas Bodley, after perusing the Cogitata et Visa, one ofthe most precious of those scattered leaves out of which the greatoracular volume was afterward made up, acknowledged that "in allproposals and plots in that book, Bacon showed himself a masterworkman"; and that "it could not be gainsaid but all the treatiseover did abound with choice conceits of the present state oflearning, and with worthy contemplations of the means to procureit."
In 1612 a new edition of the Essays appeared, with additionssurpassing the original collection both in bulk and quality.
Nor did these pursuits distract Bacon's attention from a work themost arduous, the most glorious, and the most useful that even hismighty powers could have achieved, "the reducing and recompiling,"to use his own phrase, "of the laws of England."
To serve the exacting and laborious offices of Attorney General andSolicitor General would have satisfied the appetite of any otherman for hard work, but Bacon had to add the vast literaryindustries just described, to satisfy his. He was a born worker.
The service which he rendered to letters during the last five yearsof his life, amid ten thousand distractions and vexations, increasethe regret with which we think on the many years which he hadwasted, to use the words of Sir Thomas Bodley, "on such study aswas not worthy such a student."
He commenced a digest of the laws of England, a History of Englandunder the Princes of the House of Tudor, a body of NationalHistory, a Philosophical Romance. He made extensive and valuableadditions to his Essays. He published the inestimable Treatise DeArgumentis Scientiarum.
Did these labors of Hercules fill up his time to his contentment,and quiet his appetite for work? Not entirely:
The trifles with which he amused himself in hours of pain andlanguor bore the mark of his mind. THE BEST JESTBOOK IN THE WORLDis that which he dictated from memory, without referring to anybook, on a day on which illness had rendered him incapable ofserious study.
Here are some scattered remarks (from Macaulay) which throw lightupon Bacon, and seem to indicate--and maybe demonstrate--that hewas competent to write the Plays and Poems:
With great minuteness of observation he had an amplitude ofcomprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed to any otherhuman being.
The "Essays" contain abundant proofs that no nice feature ofcharacter, no peculiarity in the ordering of a house, a garden or acourt-masque, could escape the notice of one whose mind was capableof taking in the whole world of knowledge.
His understanding resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou gaveto Prince Ahmed: fold it, and it seemed a toy for the hand of alady; spread it, and the armies of powerful Sultans might reposebeneath its shade.
The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge ofthe mutual relations of all departments of knowledge.
In a letter written when he was only thirty-one, to his uncle, LordBurleigh, he said, "I have taken all knowledge to be my province."
Though Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of logic,he adorned her profusely with all the richest decorations ofrhetoric.
The practical faculty was powerful in Bacon; but not, like his wit,so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his reason, andto tyrannize over the whole man.
There are too many places in the Plays where this happens. Poorold dying John of Gaunt volleying second-rate puns at his own name,is a pathetic instance of it. "We may assume" that it is Bacon'sfault, but the Stratford Shakespeare has to bear the blame.
No imagination was ever at once so strong and so thoroughlysubjugated. It stopped at the first check from good sense.
In truth much of Bacon's life was passed in a visionary world--amidthings as strange as any that are described in the "Arabian Tales". . . amid buildings more sumptuous than the palace of Aladdin,fountains more wonderful than the golden water of Parizade,conveyances more rapid than the hippogryph of Ruggiero, arms moreformidable than the lance of Astolfo, remedies more efficaciousthan the balsam of Fierabras. Yet in his magnificent day-dreamsthere was nothing wild--nothing but what sober reason sanctioned.
Bacon's greatest performance is the first book of the Novum Organum. . . Every part of it blazes with wit, but with wit which isemployed only to illustrate and decorate truth. No book ever madeso great a revolution in the mode of thinking, overthrew so manyprejudices, introduced so many new opinions.
But what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellectwhich, without effort, takes in at once all the domains of science--all the past, the present and the future, all the errors of twothousand years, all the encouraging signs of the passing times, allthe bright hopes of the coming age.
He had a wonderful talent for packing thought close and renderingit portable.
His eloquence would alone have entitled him to a high rank inliterature.
It is evident that he had each and every one of the mental giftsand each and every one of the acquirements that are so prodigallydisplayed in the Plays and Poems, and in much higher and richerdegree than any other man of his time or of any previous time. Hewas a genius without a mate, a prodigy not matable. There was onlyone of him; the planet could not produce two of him at one birth,nor in one age. He could have written anything that is in thePlays and Poems. He could have written this:
The cloud-cap'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,The solemn temples, the great globe itself,Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,And, like an insubstantial pageant faded,Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuffAs dreams are made on, and our little lifeIs rounded with a sleep.
Also, he could have written this, but he refrained:
Good friend for Iesus sake forbeareTo digg the dust encloased heare:Blest be ye man yt spares thes stonesAnd curst be ye yt moves my bones.
When a person reads the noble verses about the cloud-cap'd towers,he ought not to follow it immediately with Good friend for Iesussake forbeare, because he will find the transition from greatpoetry to poor prose too violent for comfort. It will give him ashock. You never notice how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is,until you bite into a layer of it in a pie.
