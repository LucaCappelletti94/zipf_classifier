Truth is stranger than fiction--to some people, but I am measurablyfamiliar with it. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged tostick to possibilities; Truth isn't. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The air was balmy and delicious, the sunshine radiant; it was a charmingexcursion. In the course of it we came to a town whose odd name wasfamous all over the world a quarter of a century ago--Wagga-Wagga. Thiswas because the Tichborne Claimant had kept a butcher-shop there. It wasout of the midst of his humble collection of sausages and tripe that hesoared up into the zenith of notoriety and hung there in the wastes ofspace a time, with the telescopes of all nations leveled at him inunappeasable curiosity--curiosity as to which of the two long-missingpersons he was: Arthur Orton, the mislaid roustabout of Wapping, or SirRoger Tichborne, the lost heir of a name and estates as old as Englishhistory. We all know now, but not a dozen people knew then; and thedozen kept the mystery to themselves and allowed the most intricate andfascinating and marvelous real-life romance that has ever been playedupon the world's stage to unfold itself serenely, act by act, in aBritish court by the long and laborious processes of judicialdevelopment.
When we recall the details of that great romance we marvel to see whatdaring chances truth may freely take in constructing a tale, as comparedwith the poor little conservative risks permitted to fiction. Thefiction-artist could achieve no success with the materials of thissplendid Tichborne romance.
He would have to drop out the chief characters; the public would say suchpeople are impossible. He would have to drop out a number of the mostpicturesque incidents; the public would say such things could neverhappen. And yet the chief characters did exist, and the incidents didhappen.
It cost the Tichborne estates $400,000 to unmask the Claimant and drivehim out; and even after the exposure multitudes of Englishmen stillbelieved in him. It cost the British Government another $400,000 toconvict him of perjury; and after the conviction the same old multitudesstill believed in him; and among these believers were many educated andintelligent men; and some of them had personally known the real SirRoger. The Claimant was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment. When hegot out of prison he went to New York and kept a whisky saloon in theBowery for a time, then disappeared from view.
He always claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne until death called for him.This was but a few months ago--not very much short of a generation sincehe left Wagga-Wagga to go and possess himself of his estates. On hisdeath-bed he yielded up his secret, and confessed in writing that he wasonly Arthur Orton of Wapping, able seaman and butcher--that and nothingmore. But it is scarcely to be doubted that there are people whom evenhis dying confession will not convince. The old habit of assimilatingincredibilities must have made strong food a necessity in their case; aweaker article would probably disagree with them.
I was in London when the Claimant stood his trial for perjury. Iattended one of his showy evenings in the sumptuous quarters provided forhim from the purses of his adherents and well-wishers. He was in eveningdress, and I thought him a rather fine and stately creature. There wereabout twenty-five gentlemen present; educated men, men moving in goodsociety, none of them commonplace; some of them were men of distinction,none of them were obscurities. They were his cordial friends andadmirers. It was "Sir Roger," always "Sir Roger," on all hands; no onewithheld the title, all turned it from the tongue with unction, and as ifit tasted good.
For many years I had had a mystery in stock. Melbourne, and onlyMelbourne, could unriddle it for me. In 1873 I arrived in London with mywife and young child, and presently received a note from Naples signed bya name not familiar to me. It was not Bascom, and it was not Henry; butI will call it Henry Bascom for convenience's sake. This note, of aboutsix lines, was written on a strip of white paper whose end-edges wereragged. I came to be familiar with those strips in later years. Theirsize and pattern were always the same. Their contents were usually tothe same effect: would I and mine come to the writer's country-place inEngland on such and such a date, by such and such a train, and staytwelve days and depart by such and such a train at the end of thespecified time? A carriage would meet us at the station.
These invitations were always for a long time ahead; if we were inEurope, three months ahead; if we were in America, six to twelve monthsahead. They always named the exact date and train for the beginning andalso for the end of the visit.
This first note invited us for a date three months in the future. Itasked us to arrive by the 4.10 p.m. train from London, August 6th. Thecarriage would be waiting. The carriage would take us away seven dayslater-train specified. And there were these words: "Speak to TomHughes."
I showed the note to the author of "Tom Brown at Rugby," and he said:"Accept, and be thankful."
He described Mr. Bascom as being a man of genius, a man of fineattainments, a choice man in every way, a rare and beautiful character.He said that Bascom Hall was a particularly fine example of the statelymanorial mansion of Elizabeth's days, and that it was a house worth goinga long way to see--like Knowle; that Mr. B. was of a social disposition;liked the company of agreeable people, and always had samples of the sortcoming and going.
We paid the visit. We paid others, in later years--the last one in 1879.Soon after that Mr. Bascom started on a voyage around the world in asteam yacht--a long and leisurely trip, for he was making collections, inall lands, of birds, butterflies, and such things.
The day that President Garfield was shot by the assassin Guiteau, we wereat a little watering place on Long Island Sound; and in the mail matterof that day came a letter with the Melbourne post-mark on it. It was formy wife, but I recognized Mr. Bascom's handwriting on the envelope, andopened it. It was the usual note--as to paucity of lines--and waswritten on the customary strip of paper; but there was nothing usualabout the contents. The note informed my wife that if it would be anyassuagement of her grief to know that her husband's lecture-tour inAustralia was a satisfactory venture from the beginning to the end, he,the writer, could testify that such was the case; also, that herhusband's untimely death had been mourned by all classes, as she wouldalready know by the press telegrams, long before the reception of thisnote; that the funeral was attended by the officials of the colonial andcity governments; and that while he, the writer, her friend and mine, hadnot reached Melbourne in time to see the body, he had at least had thesad privilege of acting as one of the pall-bearers. Signed, "HenryBascom."
My first thought was, why didn't he have the coffin opened? He wouldhave seen that the corpse was an imposter, and he could have gone rightahead and dried up the most of those tears, and comforted those sorrowinggovernments, and sold the remains and sent me the money.
I did nothing about the matter. I had set the law after living lecturedoubles of mine a couple of times in America, and the law had not beenable to catch them; others in my trade had tried to catch theirimpostor-doubles and had failed. Then where was the use in harrying aghost? None--and so I did not disturb it. I had a curiosity to knowabout that man's lecture-tour and last moments, but that could wait.When I should see Mr. Bascom he would tell me all about it. But hepassed from life, and I never saw him again.. My curiosity faded away.
However, when I found that I was going to Australia it revived. Andnaturally: for if the people should say that I was a dull, poor thingcompared to what I was before I died, it would have a bad effect onbusiness. Well, to my surprise the Sydney journalists had never heard ofthat impostor! I pressed them, but they were firm--they had never heardof him, and didn't believe in him.
I could not understand it; still, I thought it would all come right inMelbourne. The government would remember; and the other mourners. Atthe supper of the Institute of Journalists I should find out all aboutthe matter. But no--it turned out that they had never heard of it.
So my mystery was a mystery still. It was a great disappointment. Ibelieved it would never be cleared up--in this life--so I dropped it outof my mind.
But at last! just when I was least expecting it----
However, this is not the place for the rest of it; I shall come to thematter again, in a far-distant chapter.
