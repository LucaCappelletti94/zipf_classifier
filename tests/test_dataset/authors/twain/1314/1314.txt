Bayreuth, Aug. 2d, 1891It was at Nuremberg that we struck the inundation of music-mad strangers that was rolling down upon Bayreuth. It had beenlong since we had seen such multitudes of excited and strugglingpeople. It took a good half-hour to pack them and pair them intothe train--and it was the longest train we have yet seen inEurope. Nuremberg had been witnessing this sort of experience acouple of times a day for about two weeks. It gives one animpressive sense of the magnitude of this biennial pilgrimage.For a pilgrimage is what it is. The devotees come from the veryends of the earth to worship their prophet in his own Kaaba inhis own Mecca.If you are living in New York or San Francisco or Chicago oranywhere else in America, and you conclude, by the middle of May,that you would like to attend the Bayreuth opera two months and ahalf later, you must use the cable and get about it immediatelyor you will get no seats, and you must cable for lodgings, too.Then if you are lucky you will get seats in the last row andlodgings in the fringe of the town. If you stop to write youwill get nothing. There were plenty of people in Nuremberg whenwe passed through who had come on pilgrimage without firstsecuring seats and lodgings. They had found neither in Bayreuth;they had walked Bayreuth streets a while in sorrow, then had goneto Nuremberg and found neither beds nor standing room, and hadwalked those quaint streets all night, waiting for the hotels toopen and empty their guests into trains, and so make room forthese, their defeated brethren and sisters in the faith. Theyhad endured from thirty to forty hours' railroading on thecontinent of Europe--with all which that implies of worry,fatigue, and financial impoverishment--and all they had got andall they were to get for it was handiness and accuracy in kickingthemselves, acquired by practice in the back streets of the twotowns when other people were in bed; for back they must go overthat unspeakable journey with their pious mission unfulfilled.These humiliated outcasts had the frowsy and unbrushed andapologetic look of wet cats, and their eyes were glazed withdrowsiness, their bodies were adroop from crown to sole, and allkind-hearted people refrained from asking them if they had beento Bayreuth and failed to connect, as knowing they would lie.We reached here (Bayreuth) about mid-afternoon of a rainySaturday. We were of the wise, and had secured lodgings andopera seats months in advance.I am not a musical critic, and did not come here to writeessays about the operas and deliver judgment upon their merits.The little children of Bayreuth could do that with a finersympathy and a broader intelligence than I. I only care to bringfour or five pilgrims to the operas, pilgrims able to appreciatethem and enjoy them. What I write about the performance to putin my odd time would be offered to the public as merely a cat'sview of a king, and not of didactic value.Next day, which was Sunday, we left for the opera-house--that is to say, the Wagner temple--a little after the middle ofthe afternoon. The great building stands all by itself, grandand lonely, on a high ground outside the town. We were warnedthat if we arrived after four o'clock we should be obliged to paytwo dollars and a half extra by way of fine. We saved that; andit may be remarked here that this is the only opportunity thatEurope offers of saving money. There was a big crowd in thegrounds about the building, and the ladies' dresses took the sunwith fine effect. I do not mean to intimate that the ladies werein full dress, for that was not so. The dresses were pretty, butneither sex was in evening dress.The interior of the building is simple--severely so; butthere is no occasion for color and decoration, since the peoplesit in the dark. The auditorium has the shape of a keystone,with the stage at the narrow end. There is an aisle on eachside, but no aisle in the body of the house. Each row of seatsextends in an unbroken curve from one side of the house to theother. There are seven entrance doors on each side of thetheater and four at the butt, eighteen doors to admit and emit1,650 persons. The number of the particular door by which youare to enter the house or leave it is printed on your ticket, andyou can use no door but that one. Thus, crowding and confusionare impossible. Not so many as a hundred people use any onedoor. This is better than having the usual (and useless)elaborate fireproof arrangements. It is the model theater of theworld. It can be emptied while the second hand of a watch makesits circuit. It would be entirely safe, even if it were built oflucifer matches.If your seat is near the center of a row and you enter lateyou must work your way along a rank of about twenty-five ladiesand gentlemen to get to it. Yet this causes no trouble, foreverybody stands up until all the seats are full, and the fillingis accomplished in a very few minutes. Then all sit down, andyou have a solid mass of fifteen hundred heads, making a steepcellar-door slant from the rear of the house down to the stage.All the lights were turned low, so low that the congregationsat in a deep and solemn gloom. The funereal rustling of dressesand the low buzz of conversation began to die swiftly down, andpresently not the ghost of a sound was left. This profound andincreasingly impressive stillness endured for some time--the bestpreparation for music, spectacle, or speech conceivable. I shouldthink our show people would have invented or imported that simpleand impressive device for securing and solidifying the attentionof an audience long ago; instead of which there continue to thisday to open a performance against a deadly competition in theform of noise, confusion, and a scattered interest.Finally, out of darkness and distance and mystery soft richnotes rose upon the stillness, and from his grave the deadmagician began to weave his spells about his disciples and steeptheir souls in his enchantments. There was something strangelyimpressive in the fancy which kept intruding itself that thecomposer was conscious in his grave of what was going on here,and that these divine souls were the clothing of thoughts whichwere at this moment passing through his brain, and not recognizedand familiar ones which had issued from it at some former time.The entire overture, long as it was, was played to a darkhouse with the curtain down. It was exquisite; it was delicious.But straightway thereafter, or course, came the singing, and itdoes seem to me that nothing can make a Wagner opera absolutelyperfect and satisfactory to the untutored but to leave out thevocal parts. I wish I could see a Wagner opera done in pantomimeonce. Then one would have the lovely orchestration unvexed tolisten to and bathe his spirit in, and the bewildering beautifulscenery to intoxicate his eyes with, and the dumb acting couldn'tmar these pleasures, because there isn't often anything in theWagner opera that one would call by such a violent name asacting; as a rule all you would see would be a couple of silentpeople, one of them standing still, the other catching flies. Ofcourse I do not really mean that he would be catching flies; Ionly mean that the usual operatic gestures which consist inreaching first one hand out into the air and then the other mightsuggest the sport I speak of if the operator attended strictly tobusiness and uttered no sound.This present opera was "Parsifal." Madame Wagner does notpermit its representation anywhere but in Bayreuth. The firstact of the three occupied two hours, and I enjoyed that in spiteof the singing.I trust that I know as well as anybody that singing is oneof the most entrancing and bewitching and moving and eloquent ofall the vehicles invented by man for the conveying of feeling;but it seems to me that the chief virtue in song is melody, air,tune, rhythm, or what you please to call it, and that when thisfeature is absent what remains is a picture with the color leftout. I was not able to detect in the vocal parts of "Parsifal"anything that might with confidence be called rhythm or tune ormelody; one person performed at a time--and a long time, too--often in a noble, and always in a high-toned, voice; but he onlypulled out long notes, then some short ones, then another longone, then a sharp, quick, peremptory bark or two--and so on andso on; and when he was done you saw that the information which hehad conveyed had not compensated for the disturbance. Notalways, but pretty often. If two of them would but put in a duetoccasionally and blend the voices; but no, they don't do that.The great master, who knew so well how to make a hundredinstruments rejoice in unison and pour out their souls in mingledand melodious tides of delicious sound, deals only in barrensolos when he puts in the vocal parts. It may be that he wasdeep, and only added the singing to his operas for the sake ofthe contrast it would make with the music. Singing! It doesseem the wrong name to apply to it. Strictly described, it is apracticing of difficult and unpleasant intervals, mainly. Anignorant person gets tired of listening to gymnastic intervals inthe long run, no matter how pleasant they may be. In "Parsifal"there is a hermit named Gurnemanz who stands on the stage in onespot and practices by the hour, while first one and then anothercharacter of the cast endures what he can of it and then retiresto die.During the evening there was an intermission of three-quarters of an hour after the first act and one an hour longafter the second. In both instances the theater was totallyemptied. People who had previously engaged tables in the onesole eating-house were able to put in their time verysatisfactorily; the other thousand went hungry. The opera wasconcluded at ten in the evening or a little later. When wereached home we had been gone more than seven hours. Seven hoursat five dollars a ticket is almost too much for the money.While browsing about the front yard among the crowd betweenthe acts I encountered twelve or fifteen friends from differentparts of America, and those of them who were most familiar withWagner said that "Parsifal" seldom pleased at first, but thatafter one had heard it several times it was almost sure to becomea favorite. It seemed impossible, but it was true, for thestatement came from people whose word was not to be doubted.And I gathered some further information. On the ground Ifound part of a German musical magazine, and in it a letterwritten by Uhlic thirty-three years ago, in which he defends thescorned and abused Wagner against people like me, who found faultwith the comprehensive absence of what our kind regards assinging. Uhlic says Wagner despised "JENE PLAPPERUDE MUSIC," andtherefore "runs, trills, and SCHNORKEL are discarded by him." Idon't know what a SCHNORKEL is, but now that I know it has beenleft out of these operas I never have missed so much in my life.And Uhlic further says that Wagner's song is true: that it is"simply emphasized intoned speech." That certainly describes it--in "Parsifal" and some of the operas; and if I understandUhlic's elaborate German he apologizes for the beautiful airs in"Tannh:auser." Very well; now that Wagner and I understand eachother, perhaps we shall get along better, and I shall stopcalling Waggner, on the American plan, and thereafter call himWaggner as per German custom, for I feel entirely friendly now.The minute we get reconciled to a person, how willing we are tothrow aside little needless puctilios and pronounce his nameright!Of course I came home wondering why people should come fromall corners of America to hear these operas, when we have latelyhad a season or two of them in New York with these same singersin the several parts, and possibly this same orchestra. Iresolved to think that out at all hazards.TUESDAY.--Yesterday they played the only operatic favorite Ihave ever had--an opera which has always driven me mad withignorant delight whenever I have heard it--"Tannh:auser." Iheard it first when I was a youth; I heard it last in the lastGerman season in New York. I was busy yesterday and I did notintend to go, knowing I should have another "Tannh:auser"opportunity in a few days; but after five o'clock I found myselffree and walked out to the opera-house and arrived about thebeginning of the second act. My opera ticket admitted me to thegrounds in front, past the policeman and the chain, and I thoughtI would take a rest on a bench for an hour and two and wait forthe third act.In a moment or so the first bugles blew, and the multitudebegan to crumble apart and melt into the theater. I will explainthat this bugle-call is one of the pretty features here. Yousee, the theater is empty, and hundreds of the audience are agood way off in the feeding-house; the first bugle-call is blownabout a quarter of an hour before time for the curtain to rise.This company of buglers, in uniform, march out with military stepand send out over the landscape a few bars of the theme of theapproaching act, piercing the distances with the gracious notes;then they march to the other entrance and repeat. Presently theydo this over again. Yesterday only about two hundred people werestill left in front of the house when the second call was blown;in another half-minute they would have been in the house, butthen a thing happened which delayed them--the only solitary thingin this world which could be relied on with certainty toaccomplish it, I suppose--an imperial princess appeared in thebalcony above them. They stopped dead in their tracks and beganto gaze in a stupor of gratitude and satisfaction. The ladypresently saw that she must disappear or the doors would beclosed upon these worshipers, so she returned to her box. Thisdaughter-in-law of an emperor was pretty; she had a kind face;she was without airs; she is known to be full of common humansympathies. There are many kinds of princesses, but this kind isthe most harmful of all, for wherever they go they reconcilepeople to monarchy and set back the clock of progress. Thevaluable princes, the desirable princes, are the czars and theirsort. By their mere dumb presence in the world they cover withderision every argument that can be invented in favor of royaltyby the most ingenious casuist. In his time the husband of thisprincess was valuable. He led a degraded life, he ended it withhis own hand in circumstances and surroundings of a hideous sort,and was buried like a god.In the opera-house there is a long loft back of theaudience, a kind of open gallery, in which princes are displayed.It is sacred to them; it is the holy of holies. As soon as thefilling of the house is about complete the standing multitudeturn and fix their eyes upon the princely layout and gaze mutelyand longingly and adoringly and regretfully like sinners lookinginto heaven. They become rapt, unconscious, steeped in worship.There is no spectacle anywhere that is more pathetic than this.It is worth crossing many oceans to see. It is somehow not thesame gaze that people rivet upon a Victor Hugo, or Niagara, orthe bones of the mastodon, or the guillotine of the Revolution,or the great pyramid, or distant Vesuvius smoking in the sky, orany man long celebrated to you by his genius and achievements, orthing long celebrated to you by the praises of books andpictures--no, that gaze is only the gaze of intense curiosity,interest, wonder, engaged in drinking delicious deep draughtsthat taste good all the way down and appease and satisfy thethirst of a lifetime. Satisfy it--that is the word. Hugo andthe mastodon will still have a degree of intense interestthereafter when encountered, but never anything approaching theecstasy of that first view. The interest of a prince isdifferent. It may be envy, it may be worship, doubtless it is amixture of both--and it does not satisfy its thirst with oneview, or even noticeably diminish it. Perhaps the essence of thething is the value which men attach to a valuable something whichhas come by luck and not been earned. A dollar picked up in theroad is more satisfaction to you than the ninety-and-nine whichyou had to work for, and money won at faro or in stocks snugglesinto your heart in the same way. A prince picks up grandeur,power, and a permanent holiday and gratis support by a pureaccident, the accident of birth, and he stands always before thegrieved eye of poverty and obscurity a monumental representativeof luck. And then--supremest value of all-his is the only highfortune on the earth which is secure. The commercial millionairemay become a beggar; the illustrious statesman can make a vitalmistake and be dropped and forgotten; the illustrious general canlose a decisive battle and with it the consideration of men; butonce a prince always a prince--that is to say, an imitation god,and neither hard fortune nor an infamous character nor an addledbrain nor the speech of an ass can undeify him. By commonconsent of all the nations and all the ages the most valuablething in this world is the homage of men, whether deserved orundeserved. It follows without doubt or question, then, that themost desirable position possible is that of a prince. And Ithink it also follows that the so-called usurpations with whichhistory is littered are the most excusable misdemeanors which menhave committed. To usurp a usurpation--that is all it amountsto, isn't it?A prince is not to us what he is to a European, of course.We have not been taught to regard him as a god, and so one goodlook at him is likely to so nearly appease our curiosity as tomake him an object of no greater interest the next time. We wanta fresh one. But it is not so with the European. I am quitesure of it. The same old one will answer; he never stales.Eighteen years ago I was in London and I called at anEnglishman's house on a bleak and foggy and dismal Decemberafternoon to visit his wife and married daughter by appointment.I waited half an hour and then they arrived, frozen. Theyexplained that they had been delayed by an unlooked-forcircumstance: while passing in the neighborhood of MarlboroughHouse they saw a crowd gathering and were told that the Prince ofWales was about to drive out, so they stopped to get a sight ofhim. They had waited half an hour on the sidewalk, freezing withthe crowd, but were disappointed at last--the Prince had changedhis mind. I said, with a good deal of surprise, "Is it possiblethat you two have lived in London all your lives and have neverseen the Prince of Wales?"Apparently it was their turn to be surprised, for theyexclaimed: "What an idea! Why, we have seen him hundreds oftimes."They had seem him hundreds of times, yet they had waitedhalf an hour in the gloom and the bitter cold, in the midst of ajam of patients from the same asylum, on the chance of seeing himagain. It was a stupefying statement, but one is obliged tobelieve the English, even when they say a thing like that. Ifumbled around for a remark, and got out this one:"I can't understand it at all. If I had never seen GeneralGrant I doubt if I would do that even to get a sight of him."With a slight emphasis on the last word.Their blank faces showed that they wondered where theparallel came in. Then they said, blankly: "Of course not. Heis only a President."It is doubtless a fact that a prince is a permanentinterest, an interest not subject to deterioration. The generalwho was never defeated, the general who never held a council ofwar, the only general who ever commanded a connected battle-fronttwelve hundred miles long, the smith who welded together thebroken parts of a great republic and re-established it where itis quite likely to outlast all the monarchies present and tocome, was really a person of no serious consequence to thesepeople. To them, with their training, my General was only a man,after all, while their Prince was clearly much more than that--abeing of a wholly unsimilar construction and constitution, andbeing of no more blood and kinship with men than are the sereneeternal lights of the firmament with the poor dull tallow candlesof commerce that sputter and die and leave nothing behind but apinch of ashes and a stink.I saw the last act of "Tannh:auser." I sat in the gloom andthe deep stillness, waiting--one minute, two minutes, I do notknow exactly how long--then the soft music of the hiddenorchestra began to breathe its rich, long sighs out from underthe distant stage, and by and by the drop-curtain parted in themiddle and was drawn softly aside, disclosing the twilighted woodand a wayside shrine, with a white-robed girl praying and a manstanding near. Presently that noble chorus of men's voices washeard approaching, and from that moment until the closing of thecurtain it was music, just music--music to make one drunk withpleasure, music to make one take scrip and staff and beg his wayround the globe to hear it.To such as are intending to come here in the Wagner seasonnext year I wish to say, bring your dinner-pail with you. If youdo, you will never cease to be thankful. If you do not, you willfind it a hard fight to save yourself from famishing in Bayreuth.Bayreuth is merely a large village, and has no very large hotelsor eating-houses. The principal inns are the Golden Anchor andthe Sun. At either of these places you can get an excellentmeal--no, I mean you can go there and see other people get it.There is no charge for this. The town is littered withrestaurants, but they are small and bad, and they are overdrivenwith custom. You must secure a table hours beforehand, and oftenwhen you arrive you will find somebody occupying it. We have hadthis experience. We have had a daily scramble for life; and whenI say we, I include shoals of people. I have the impression thatthe only people who do not have to scramble are the veterans--thedisciples who have been here before and know the ropes. I thinkthey arrive about a week before the first opera, and engage allthe tables for the season. My tribe had tried all kinds ofplaces--some outside of the town, a mile or two--and havecaptured only nibblings and odds and ends, never in any instancea complete and satisfying meal. Digestible? No, the reverse.These odds and ends are going to serve as souvenirs of Bayreuth,and in that regard their value is not to be overestimated.Photographs fade, bric-a-brac gets lost, busts of Wagner getbroken, but once you absorb a Bayreuth-restaurant meal it is yourpossession and your property until the time comes to embalm therest of you. Some of these pilgrims here become, in effect,cabinets; cabinets of souvenirs of Bayreuth. It is believedamong scientists that you could examine the crop of a deadBayreuth pilgrim anywhere in the earth and tell where he camefrom. But I like this ballast. I think a "Hermitage" scrap-upat eight in the evening, when all the famine-breeders have beenthere and laid in their mementoes and gone, is the quietest thingyou can lay on your keelson except gravel.THURSDAY.--They keep two teams of singers in stock for thechief roles, and one of these is composed of the most renownedartists in the world, with Materna and Alvary in the lead. Isuppose a double team is necessary; doubtless a single team woulddie of exhaustion in a week, for all the plays last from four inthe afternoon till ten at night. Nearly all the labor falls uponthe half-dozen head singers, and apparently they are required tofurnish all the noise they can for the money. If they feel asoft, whispery, mysterious feeling they are required to open outand let the public know it. Operas are given only on Sundays,Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, with three days of ostensiblerest per week, and two teams to do the four operas; but theostensible rest is devoted largely to rehearsing. It is saidthat the off days are devoted to rehearsing from some time in themorning till ten at night. Are there two orchestras also? It isquite likely, since there are one hundred and ten names in theorchestra list.Yesterday the opera was "Tristan and Isolde." I have seenall sorts of audiences--at theaters, operas, concerts, lectures,sermons, funerals--but none which was twin to the Wagner audienceof Bayreuth for fixed and reverential attention. Absoluteattention and petrified retention to the end of an act of theattitude assumed at the beginning of it. You detect no movementin the solid mass of heads and shoulders. You seem to sit withthe dead in the gloom of a tomb. You know that they are beingstirred to their profoundest depths; that there are times whenthey want to rise and wave handkerchiefs and shout theirapprobation, and times when tears are running down their faces,and it would be a relief to free their pent emotions in sobs orscreams; yet you hear not one utterance till the curtain swingstogether and the closing strains have slowly faded out and died;then the dead rise with one impulse and shake the building withtheir applause. Every seat is full in the first act; there isnot a vacant one in the last. If a man would be conspicuous, lethim come here and retire from the house in the midst of an act.It would make him celebrated.This audience reminds me of nothing I have ever seen and ofnothing I have read about except the city in the Arabian talewhere all the inhabitants have been turned to brass and thetraveler finds them after centuries mute, motionless, and stillretaining the attitudes which they last knew in life. Here theWagner audience dress as they please, and sit in the dark andworship in silence. At the Metropolitan in New York they sit ina glare, and wear their showiest harness; they hum airs, theysqueak fans, they titter, and they gabble all the time. In someof the boxes the conversation and laughter are so loud as todivide the attention of the house with the stage. In largemeasure the Metropolitan is a show-case for rich fashionables whoare not trained in Wagnerian music and have no reverence for it,but who like to promote art and show their clothes.Can that be an agreeable atmosphere to persons in whom thismusic produces a sort of divine ecstasy and to whom its creatoris a very deity, his stage a temple, the works of his brain andhands consecrated things, and the partaking of them with eye andear a sacred solemnity? Manifestly, no. Then, perhaps thetemporary expatriation, the tedious traversing of seas andcontinents, the pilgrimage to Bayreuth stands explained. Thesedevotees would worship in an atmosphere of devotion. It is onlyhere that they can find it without fleck or blemish or anyworldly pollution. In this remote village there are no sights tosee, there is no newspaper to intrude the worries of the distantworld, there is nothing going on, it is always Sunday. Thepilgrim wends to his temple out of town, sits out his movingservice, returns to his bed with his heart and soul and his bodyexhausted by long hours of tremendous emotion, and he is in nofit condition to do anything but to lie torpid and slowly gatherback life and strength for the next service. This opera of"Tristan and Isolde" last night broke the hearts of all witnesseswho were of the faith, and I know of some who have heard of manywho could not sleep after it, but cried the night away. I feelstrongly out of place here. Sometimes I feel like the saneperson in a community of the mad; sometimes I feel like the oneblind man where all others see; the one groping savage in thecollege of the learned, and always, during service, I feel like aheretic in heaven.But by no means do I ever overlook or minify the fact thatthis is one of the most extraordinary experiences of my life. Ihave never seen anything like this before. I have never seenanything so great and fine and real as this devotion.FRIDAY.--Yesterday's opera was "Parsifal" again. The otherswent and they show marked advance in appreciation; but I wenthunting for relics and reminders of the Margravine Wilhelmina,she of the imperishable "Memoirs." I am properly grateful to herfor her (unconscious) satire upon monarchy and nobility, andtherefore nothing which her hand touched or her eye looked uponis indifferent to me. I am her pilgrim; the rest of thismultitude here are Wagner's.TUESDAY.--I have seen my last two operas; my season isended, and we cross over into Bohemia this afternoon. I wassupposing that my musical regeneration was accomplished andperfected, because I enjoyed both of these operas, singing andall, and, moreover, one of them was "Parsifal," but the expertshave disenchanted me. They say:"Singing! That wasn't singing; that was the wailing,screeching of third-rate obscurities, palmed off on us in theinterest of economy."Well, I ought to have recognized the sign--the old, suresign that has never failed me in matters of art. Whenever Ienjoy anything in art it means that it is mighty poor. Theprivate knowledge of this fact has saved me from going to pieceswith enthusiasm in front of many and many a chromo. However, mybase instinct does bring me profit sometimes; I was the only manout of thirty-two hundred who got his money back on those two operas.
