We cast up the account. It footed up pretty fairly. There was nothingmore at Jerusalem to be seen, except the traditional houses of Dives andLazarus of the parable, the Tombs of the Kings, and those of the Judges;the spot where they stoned one of the disciples to death, and beheadedanother; the room and the table made celebrated by the Last Supper; thefig-tree that Jesus withered; a number of historical places aboutGethsemane and the Mount of Olives, and fifteen or twenty others indifferent portions of the city itself.
We were approaching the end. Human nature asserted itself, now.Overwork and consequent exhaustion began to have their natural effect.They began to master the energies and dull the ardor of the party.Perfectly secure now, against failing to accomplish any detail of thepilgrimage, they felt like drawing in advance upon the holiday soon to beplaced to their credit. They grew a little lazy. They were late tobreakfast and sat long at dinner. Thirty or forty pilgrims had arrivedfrom the ship, by the short routes, and much swapping of gossip had to beindulged in. And in hot afternoons, they showed a strong disposition tolie on the cool divans in the hotel and smoke and talk about pleasantexperiences of a month or so gone by--for even thus early do episodes oftravel which were sometimes annoying, sometimes exasperating and full asoften of no consequence at all when they transpired, begin to rise abovethe dead level of monotonous reminiscences and become shapely landmarksin one's memory. The fog-whistle, smothered among a million of triflingsounds, is not noticed a block away, in the city, but the sailor hears itfar at sea, whither none of those thousands of trifling sounds can reach.When one is in Rome, all the domes are alike; but when he has gone awaytwelve miles, the city fades utterly from sight and leaves St. Peter'sswelling above the level plain like an anchored balloon. When one istraveling in Europe, the daily incidents seem all alike; but when he hasplaced them all two months and two thousand miles behind him, those thatwere worthy of being remembered are prominent, and those that were reallyinsignificant have vanished. This disposition to smoke, and idle andtalk, was not well. It was plain that it must not be allowed to gainground. A diversion must be tried, or demoralization would ensue. TheJordan, Jericho and the Dead Sea were suggested. The remainder ofJerusalem must be left unvisited, for a little while. The journey wasapproved at once. New life stirred in every pulse. In the saddle--abroad on the plains--sleeping in beds bounded only by the horizon: fancywas at work with these things in a moment.--It was painful to note howreadily these town-bred men had taken to the free life of the camp andthe desert The nomadic instinct is a human instinct; it was born withAdam and transmitted through the patriarchs, and after thirty centuriesof steady effort, civilization has not educated it entirely out of usyet. It has a charm which, once tasted, a man will yearn to taste again.The nomadic instinct can not be educated out of an Indian at all.
The Jordan journey being approved, our dragoman was notified.
At nine in the morning the caravan was before the hotel door and we wereat breakfast. There was a commotion about the place. Rumors of war andbloodshed were flying every where. The lawless Bedouins in the Valley ofthe Jordan and the deserts down by the Dead Sea were up in arms, and weregoing to destroy all comers. They had had a battle with a troop ofTurkish cavalry and defeated them; several men killed. They had shut upthe inhabitants of a village and a Turkish garrison in an old fort nearJericho, and were besieging them. They had marched upon a camp of ourexcursionists by the Jordan, and the pilgrims only saved their lives bystealing away and flying to Jerusalem under whip and spur in the darknessof the night. Another of our parties had been fired on from an ambushand then attacked in the open day. Shots were fired on both sides.Fortunately there was no bloodshed. We spoke with the very pilgrim whohad fired one of the shots, and learned from his own lips how, in thisimminent deadly peril, only the cool courage of the pilgrims, theirstrength of numbers and imposing display of war material, had saved themfrom utter destruction. It was reported that the Consul had requestedthat no more of our pilgrims should go to the Jordan while this state ofthings lasted; and further, that he was unwilling that any more shouldgo, at least without an unusually strong military guard. Here wastrouble. But with the horses at the door and every body aware of whatthey were there for, what would you have done? Acknowledged that youwere afraid, and backed shamefully out? Hardly. It would not be humannature, where there were so many women. You would have done as we did:said you were not afraid of a million Bedouins--and made your will andproposed quietly to yourself to take up an unostentatious position in therear of the procession.
I think we must all have determined upon the same line of tactics, for itdid seem as if we never would get to Jericho. I had a notoriously slowhorse, but somehow I could not keep him in the rear, to save my neck.He was forever turning up in the lead. In such cases I trembled alittle, and got down to fix my saddle. But it was not of any use. Theothers all got down to fix their saddles, too. I never saw such a timewith saddles. It was the first time any of them had got out of order inthree weeks, and now they had all broken down at once. I tried walking,for exercise--I had not had enough in Jerusalem searching for holyplaces. But it was a failure. The whole mob were suffering forexercise, and it was not fifteen minutes till they were all on foot and Ihad the lead again. It was very discouraging.
This was all after we got beyond Bethany. We stopped at the village ofBethany, an hour out from Jerusalem. They showed us the tomb of Lazarus.I had rather live in it than in any house in the town. And they showedus also a large "Fountain of Lazarus," and in the centre of the villagethe ancient dwelling of Lazarus. Lazarus appears to have been a man ofproperty. The legends of the Sunday Schools do him great injustice; theygive one the impression that he was poor. It is because they get himconfused with that Lazarus who had no merit but his virtue, and virtuenever has been as respectable as money. The house of Lazarus is athree-story edifice, of stone masonry, but the accumulated rubbish ofages has buried all of it but the upper story. We took candles anddescended to the dismal cell-like chambers where Jesus sat at meat withMartha and Mary, and conversed with them about their brother. We couldnot but look upon these old dingy apartments with a more than commoninterest.
We had had a glimpse, from a mountain top, of the Dead Sea, lying like ablue shield in the plain of the Jordan, and now we were marching down aclose, flaming, rugged, desolate defile, where no living creature couldenjoy life, except, perhaps, a salamander. It was such a dreary,repulsive, horrible solitude! It was the "wilderness" where Johnpreached, with camel's hair about his loins--raiment enough--but he nevercould have got his locusts and wild honey here. We were moping alongdown through this dreadful place, every man in the rear. Our guards--twogorgeous young Arab sheiks, with cargoes of swords, guns, pistols anddaggers on board--were loafing ahead.
"Bedouins!"
Every man shrunk up and disappeared in his clothes like a mud-turtle.My first impulse was to dash forward and destroy the Bedouins. My secondwas to dash to the rear to see if there were any coming in thatdirection. I acted on the latter impulse. So did all the others. Ifany Bedouins had approached us, then, from that point of the compass,they would have paid dearly for their rashness. We all remarked that,afterwards. There would have been scenes of riot and bloodshed therethat no pen could describe. I know that, because each man told what hewould have done, individually; and such a medley of strange andunheard-of inventions of cruelty you could not conceive of. One mansaid he had calmly made up his mind to perish where he stood, if needbe, but never yield an inch; he was going to wait, with deadly patience,till he could count the stripes upon the first Bedouin's jacket, andthen count them and let him have it. Another was going to sit stilltill the first lance reached within an inch of his breast, and thendodge it and seize it. I forbear to tell what he was going to do tothat Bedouin that owned it. It makes my blood run cold to think of it.Another was going to scalp such Bedouins as fell to his share, and takehis bald-headed sons of the desert home with him alive for trophies.But the wild-eyed pilgrim rhapsodist was silent. His orbs gleamed witha deadly light, but his lips moved not. Anxiety grew, and he wasquestioned. If he had got a Bedouin, what would he have done with him--shot him? He smiled a smile of grim contempt and shook his head.Would he have stabbed him? Another shake. Would he have quartered him--flayed him? More shakes. Oh! horror what would he have done?
"Eat him!"
Such was the awful sentence that thundered from his lips. What wasgrammar to a desperado like that? I was glad in my heart that I had beenspared these scenes of malignant carnage. No Bedouins attacked ourterrible rear. And none attacked the front. The new-comers were only areinforcement of cadaverous Arabs, in shirts and bare legs, sent farahead of us to brandish rusty guns, and shout and brag, and carry on likelunatics, and thus scare away all bands of marauding Bedouins that mightlurk about our path. What a shame it is that armed white Christians musttravel under guard of vermin like this as a protection against theprowling vagabonds of the desert--those sanguinary outlaws who are alwaysgoing to do something desperate, but never do it. I may as well mentionhere that on our whole trip we saw no Bedouins, and had no more use foran Arab guard than we could have had for patent leather boots and whitekid gloves. The Bedouins that attacked the other parties of pilgrims sofiercely were provided for the occasion by the Arab guards of thoseparties, and shipped from Jerusalem for temporary service as Bedouins.They met together in full view of the pilgrims, after the battle, andtook lunch, divided the bucksheesh extorted in the season of danger, andthen accompanied the cavalcade home to the city! The nuisance of an Arabguard is one which is created by the Sheiks and the Bedouins together,for mutual profit, it is said, and no doubt there is a good deal of truthin it.
We visited the fountain the prophet Elisha sweetened (it is sweet yet,)where he remained some time and was fed by the ravens.
Ancient Jericho is not very picturesque as a ruin. When Joshua marchedaround it seven times, some three thousand years ago, and blew it downwith his trumpet, he did the work so well and so completely that hehardly left enough of the city to cast a shadow. The curse pronouncedagainst the rebuilding of it, has never been removed. One King, holdingthe curse in light estimation, made the attempt, but was stricken sorelyfor his presumption. Its site will always remain unoccupied; and yet itis one of the very best locations for a town we have seen in allPalestine.
At two in the morning they routed us out of bed--another piece ofunwarranted cruelty--another stupid effort of our dragoman to get aheadof a rival. It was not two hours to the Jordan. However, we weredressed and under way before any one thought of looking to see what timeit was, and so we drowsed on through the chill night air and dreamed ofcamp fires, warm beds, and other comfortable things.
There was no conversation. People do not talk when they are cold, andwretched, and sleepy. We nodded in the saddle, at times, and woke upwith a start to find that the procession had disappeared in the gloom.Then there was energy and attention to business until its dusky outlinescame in sight again. Occasionally the order was passed in a low voicedown the line: "Close up--close up! Bedouins lurk here, every where!"What an exquisite shudder it sent shivering along one's spine!
We reached the famous river before four o'clock, and the night was soblack that we could have ridden into it without seeing it. Some of uswere in an unhappy frame of mind. We waited and waited for daylight, butit did not come. Finally we went away in the dark and slept an hour onthe ground, in the bushes, and caught cold. It was a costly nap, on thataccount, but otherwise it was a paying investment because it broughtunconsciousness of the dreary minutes and put us in a somewhat fittermood for a first glimpse of the sacred river.
With the first suspicion of dawn, every pilgrim took off his clothes andwaded into the dark torrent, singing:
 "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, And cast a wistful eye To Canaan's fair and happy land, Where my possessions lie."
But they did not sing long. The water was so fearfully cold that theywere obliged to stop singing and scamper out again. Then they stood onthe bank shivering, and so chagrined and so grieved, that they meritedholiest compassion. Because another dream, another cherished hope, hadfailed. They had promised themselves all along that they would cross theJordan where the Israelites crossed it when they entered Canaan fromtheir long pilgrimage in the desert. They would cross where the twelvestones were placed in memory of that great event. While they did it theywould picture to themselves that vast army of pilgrims marching throughthe cloven waters, bearing the hallowed ark of the covenant and shoutinghosannahs, and singing songs of thanksgiving and praise. Each hadpromised himself that he would be the first to cross. They were at thegoal of their hopes at last, but the current was too swift, the water wastoo cold!
It was then that Jack did them a service. With that engagingrecklessness of consequences which is natural to youth, and so proper andso seemly, as well, he went and led the way across the Jordan, and allwas happiness again. Every individual waded over, then, and stood uponthe further bank. The water was not quite breast deep, any where. If ithad been more, we could hardly have accomplished the feat, for the strongcurrent would have swept us down the stream, and we would have beenexhausted and drowned before reaching a place where we could make alanding. The main object compassed, the drooping, miserable party satdown to wait for the sun again, for all wanted to see the water as wellas feel it. But it was too cold a pastime. Some cans were filled fromthe holy river, some canes cut from its banks, and then we mounted androde reluctantly away to keep from freezing to death. So we saw theJordan very dimly. The thickets of bushes that bordered its banks threwtheir shadows across its shallow, turbulent waters ("stormy," the hymnmakes them, which is rather a complimentary stretch of fancy,) and wecould not judge of the width of the stream by the eye. We knew by ourwading experience, however, that many streets in America are double aswide as the Jordan.
Daylight came, soon after we got under way, and in the course of an houror two we reached the Dead Sea. Nothing grows in the flat, burningdesert around it but weeds and the Dead Sea apple the poets say isbeautiful to the eye, but crumbles to ashes and dust when you break it.Such as we found were not handsome, but they were bitter to the taste.They yielded no dust. It was because they were not ripe, perhaps.
The desert and the barren hills gleam painfully in the sun, around theDead Sea, and there is no pleasant thing or living creature upon it orabout its borders to cheer the eye. It is a scorching, arid, repulsivesolitude. A silence broods over the scene that is depressing to thespirits. It makes one think of funerals and death.
The Dead Sea is small. Its waters are very clear, and it has a pebblybottom and is shallow for some distance out from the shores. It yieldsquantities of asphaltum; fragments of it lie all about its banks; thisstuff gives the place something of an unpleasant smell.
All our reading had taught us to expect that the first plunge into theDead Sea would be attended with distressing results--our bodies wouldfeel as if they were suddenly pierced by millions of red-hot needles; thedreadful smarting would continue for hours; we might even look to beblistered from head to foot, and suffer miserably for many days. We weredisappointed. Our eight sprang in at the same time that another party ofpilgrims did, and nobody screamed once. None of them ever did complainof any thing more than a slight pricking sensation in places where theirskin was abraded, and then only for a short time. My face smarted for acouple of hours, but it was partly because I got it badly sun-burnedwhile I was bathing, and staid in so long that it became plastered overwith salt.
No, the water did not blister us; it did not cover us with a slimy oozeand confer upon us an atrocious fragrance; it was not very slimy; and Icould not discover that we smelt really any worse than we have alwayssmelt since we have been in Palestine. It was only a different kind ofsmell, but not conspicuous on that account, because we have a great dealof variety in that respect. We didn't smell, there on the Jordan, thesame as we do in Jerusalem; and we don't smell in Jerusalem just as wedid in Nazareth, or Tiberias, or Cesarea Philippi, or any of those otherruinous ancient towns in Galilee. No, we change all the time, andgenerally for the worse. We do our own washing.
It was a funny bath. We could not sink. One could stretch himself atfull length on his back, with his arms on his breast, and all of his bodyabove a line drawn from the corner of his jaw past the middle of hisside, the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone, would remain outof water. He could lift his head clear out, if he chose. No positioncan be retained long; you lose your balance and whirl over, first on yourback and then on your face, and so on. You can lie comfortably, on yourback, with your head out, and your legs out from your knees down, bysteadying yourself with your hands. You can sit, with your knees drawnup to your chin and your arms clasped around them, but you are bound toturn over presently, because you are top-heavy in that position. You canstand up straight in water that is over your head, and from the middle ofyour breast upward you will not be wet. But you can not remain so. Thewater will soon float your feet to the surface. You can not swim on yourback and make any progress of any consequence, because your feet stickaway above the surface, and there is nothing to propel yourself with butyour heels. If you swim on your face, you kick up the water like astern-wheel boat. You make no headway. A horse is so top-heavy that hecan neither swim nor stand up in the Dead Sea. He turns over on his sideat once. Some of us bathed for more than an hour, and then came outcoated with salt till we shone like icicles. We scrubbed it off with acoarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand-new smell, though it wasone which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been forseveral weeks enjoying. It was the variegated villainy and novelty of itthat charmed us. Salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores ofthe lake. In places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice.
When I was a boy I somehow got the impression that the river Jordan wasfour thousand miles long and thirty-five miles wide. It is only ninetymiles long, and so crooked that a man does not know which side of it heis on half the time. In going ninety miles it does not get over morethan fifty miles of ground. It is not any wider than Broadway in NewYork.
There is the Sea of Galilee and this Dead Sea--neither of them twentymiles long or thirteen wide. And yet when I was in Sunday School Ithought they were sixty thousand miles in diameter.
Travel and experience mar the grandest pictures and rob us of the mostcherished traditions of our boyhood. Well, let them go. I have alreadyseen the Empire of King Solomon diminish to the size of the State ofPennsylvania; I suppose I can bear the reduction of the seas and theriver.
We looked every where, as we passed along, but never saw grain or crystalof Lot's wife. It was a great disappointment. For many and many a yearwe had known her sad story, and taken that interest in her whichmisfortune always inspires. But she was gone. Her picturesque form nolonger looms above the desert of the Dead Sea to remind the tourist ofthe doom that fell upon the lost cities.
I can not describe the hideous afternoon's ride from the Dead Sea to MarsSaba. It oppresses me yet, to think of it. The sun so pelted us thatthe tears ran down our cheeks once or twice. The ghastly, treeless,grassless, breathless canons smothered us as if we had been in an oven.The sun had positive weight to it, I think. Not a man could sit erectunder it. All drooped low in the saddles. John preached in this"Wilderness!" It must have been exhausting work. What a very heaven themessy towers and ramparts of vast Mars Saba looked to us when we caught afirst glimpse of them!
We staid at this great convent all night, guests of the hospitablepriests. Mars Saba, perched upon a crag, a human nest stock high upagainst a perpendicular mountain wall, is a world of grand masonry thatrises, terrace upon terrace away above your head, like the terraced andretreating colonnades one sees in fanciful pictures of Belshazzar's Feastand the palaces of the ancient Pharaohs. No other human dwelling isnear. It was founded many ages ago by a holy recluse who lived at firstin a cave in the rock--a cave which is inclosed in the convent walls,now, and was reverently shown to us by the priests. This recluse, by hisrigorous torturing of his flesh, his diet of bread and water, his utterwithdrawal from all society and from the vanities of the world, and hisconstant prayer and saintly contemplation of a skull, inspired anemulation that brought about him many disciples. The precipice on theopposite side of the canyon is well perforated with the small holes theydug in the rock to live in. The present occupants of Mars Saba, aboutseventy in number, are all hermits. They wear a coarse robe, an ugly,brimless stove-pipe of a hat, and go without shoes. They eat nothingwhatever but bread and salt; they drink nothing but water. As long asthey live they can never go outside the walls, or look upon a woman--forno woman is permitted to enter Mars Saba, upon any pretext whatsoever.
Some of those men have been shut up there for thirty years. In all thatdreary time they have not heard the laughter of a child or the blessedvoice of a woman; they have seen no human tears, no human smiles; theyhave known no human joys, no wholesome human sorrows. In their heartsare no memories of the past, in their brains no dreams of the future.All that is lovable, beautiful, worthy, they have put far away from them;against all things that are pleasant to look upon, and all sounds thatare music to the ear, they have barred their massive doors and rearedtheir relentless walls of stone forever. They have banished the tendergrace of life and left only the sapped and skinny mockery. Their lipsare lips that never kiss and never sing; their hearts are hearts thatnever hate and never love; their breasts are breasts that never swellwith the sentiment, "I have a country and a flag." They are dead men whowalk.
I set down these first thoughts because they are natural--not becausethey are just or because it is right to set them down. It is easy forbook-makers to say "I thought so and so as I looked upon such and such ascene"--when the truth is, they thought all those fine things afterwards.One's first thought is not likely to be strictly accurate, yet it is nocrime to think it and none to write it down, subject to modification bylater experience. These hermits are dead men, in several respects, butnot in all; and it is not proper, that, thinking ill of them at first, Ishould go on doing so, or, speaking ill of them I should reiterate thewords and stick to them. No, they treated us too kindly for that. Thereis something human about them somewhere. They knew we were foreignersand Protestants, and not likely to feel admiration or much friendlinesstoward them. But their large charity was above considering such things.They simply saw in us men who were hungry, and thirsty, and tired, andthat was sufficient. They opened their doors and gave us welcome. Theyasked no questions, and they made no self-righteous display of theirhospitality. They fished for no compliments. They moved quietly about,setting the table for us, making the beds, and bringing water to wash in,and paid no heed when we said it was wrong for them to do that when wehad men whose business it was to perform such offices. We fared mostcomfortably, and sat late at dinner. We walked all over the buildingwith the hermits afterward, and then sat on the lofty battlements andsmoked while we enjoyed the cool air, the wild scenery and the sunset.One or two chose cosy bed-rooms to sleep in, but the nomadic instinctprompted the rest to sleep on the broad divan that extended around thegreat hall, because it seemed like sleeping out of doors, and so was morecheery and inviting. It was a royal rest we had.
When we got up to breakfast in the morning, we were new men. For allthis hospitality no strict charge was made. We could give something ifwe chose; we need give nothing, if we were poor or if we were stingy.The pauper and the miser are as free as any in the Catholic Convents ofPalestine. I have been educated to enmity toward every thing that isCatholic, and sometimes, in consequence of this, I find it much easier todiscover Catholic faults than Catholic merits. But there is one thing Ifeel no disposition to overlook, and no disposition to forget: and thatis, the honest gratitude I and all pilgrims owe, to the Convent Fathersin Palestine. Their doors are always open, and there is always a welcomefor any worthy man who comes, whether he comes in rags or clad in purple.The Catholic Convents are a priceless blessing to the poor. A pilgrimwithout money, whether he be a Protestant or a Catholic, can travel thelength and breadth of Palestine, and in the midst of her desert wastesfind wholesome food and a clean bed every night, in these buildings.Pilgrims in better circumstances are often stricken down by the sun andthe fevers of the country, and then their saving refuge is the Convent.Without these hospitable retreats, travel in Palestine would be apleasure which none but the strongest men could dare to undertake. Ourparty, pilgrims and all, will always be ready and always willing, totouch glasses and drink health, prosperity and long life to the ConventFathers of Palestine.
So, rested and refreshed, we fell into line and filed away over thebarren mountains of Judea, and along rocky ridges and through sterilegorges, where eternal silence and solitude reigned. Even the scatteringgroups of armed shepherds we met the afternoon before, tending theirflocks of long-haired goats, were wanting here. We saw but two livingcreatures. They were gazelles, of "soft-eyed" notoriety. They lookedlike very young kids, but they annihilated distance like an expresstrain. I have not seen animals that moved faster, unless I might say itof the antelopes of our own great plains.
At nine or ten in the morning we reached the Plain of the Shepherds, andstood in a walled garden of olives where the shepherds were watchingtheir flocks by night, eighteen centuries ago, when the multitude ofangels brought them the tidings that the Saviour was born. A quarter ofa mile away was Bethlehem of Judea, and the pilgrims took some of thestone wall and hurried on.
The Plain of the Shepherds is a desert, paved with loose stones, void ofvegetation, glaring in the fierce sun. Only the music of the angels itknew once could charm its shrubs and flowers to life again and restoreits vanished beauty. No less potent enchantment could avail to work thismiracle.
In the huge Church of the Nativity, in Bethlehem, built fifteen hundredyears ago by the inveterate St. Helena, they took us below ground, andinto a grotto cut in the living rock. This was the "manger" where Christwas born. A silver star set in the floor bears a Latin inscription tothat effect. It is polished with the kisses of many generations ofworshiping pilgrims. The grotto was tricked out in the usual tastelessstyle observable in all the holy places of Palestine. As in the Churchof the Holy Sepulchre, envy and uncharitableness were apparent here. Thepriests and the members of the Greek and Latin churches can not come bythe same corridor to kneel in the sacred birthplace of the Redeemer, butare compelled to approach and retire by different avenues, lest theyquarrel and fight on this holiest ground on earth.
I have no "meditations," suggested by this spot where the very first"Merry Christmas!" was uttered in all the world, and from whence thefriend of my childhood, Santa Claus, departed on his first journey, togladden and continue to gladden roaring firesides on wintry mornings inmany a distant land forever and forever. I touch, with reverent finger,the actual spot where the infant Jesus lay, but I think--nothing.
You can not think in this place any more than you can in any other inPalestine that would be likely to inspire reflection. Beggars, cripplesand monks compass you about, and make you think only of bucksheesh whenyou would rather think of something more in keeping with the character ofthe spot.
I was glad to get away, and glad when we had walked through the grottoeswhere Eusebius wrote, and Jerome fasted, and Joseph prepared for theflight into Egypt, and the dozen other distinguished grottoes, and knewwe were done. The Church of the Nativity is almost as well packed withexceeding holy places as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre itself. Theyeven have in it a grotto wherein twenty thousand children wereslaughtered by Herod when he was seeking the life of the infant Saviour.
We went to the Milk Grotto, of course--a cavern where Mary hid herselffor a while before the flight into Egypt. Its walls were black beforeshe entered, but in suckling the Child, a drop of her milk fell upon thefloor and instantly changed the darkness of the walls to its own snowyhue. We took many little fragments of stone from here, because it iswell known in all the East that a barren woman hath need only to touchher lips to one of these and her failing will depart from her. We tookmany specimens, to the end that we might confer happiness upon certainhouseholds that we wot of.
We got away from Bethlehem and its troops of beggars and relic-peddlersin the afternoon, and after spending some little time at Rachel's tomb,hurried to Jerusalem as fast as possible. I never was so glad to gethome again before. I never have enjoyed rest as I have enjoyed it duringthese last few hours. The journey to the Dead Sea, the Jordan andBethlehem was short, but it was an exhausting one. Such roasting heat,such oppressive solitude, and such dismal desolation can not surely existelsewhere on earth. And such fatigue!
The commonest sagacity warns me that I ought to tell the customarypleasant lie, and say I tore myself reluctantly away from every notedplace in Palestine. Every body tells that, but with as littleostentation as I may, I doubt the word of every he who tells it. I couldtake a dreadful oath that I have never heard any one of our fortypilgrims say any thing of the sort, and they are as worthy and assincerely devout as any that come here. They will say it when they gethome, fast enough, but why should they not? They do not wish to arraythemselves against all the Lamartines and Grimeses in the world. It doesnot stand to reason that men are reluctant to leave places where the verylife is almost badgered out of them by importunate swarms of beggars andpeddlers who hang in strings to one's sleeves and coat-tails and shriekand shout in his ears and horrify his vision with the ghastly sores andmalformations they exhibit. One is glad to get away. I have heardshameless people say they were glad to get away from Ladies' Festivalswhere they were importuned to buy by bevies of lovely young ladies.Transform those houris into dusky hags and ragged savages, and replacetheir rounded forms with shrunken and knotted distortions, their softhands with scarred and hideous deformities, and the persuasive music oftheir voices with the discordant din of a hated language, and then seehow much lingering reluctance to leave could be mustered. No, it is theneat thing to say you were reluctant, and then append the profoundthoughts that "struggled for utterance," in your brain; but it is thetrue thing to say you were not reluctant, and found it impossible tothink at all--though in good sooth it is not respectable to say it, andnot poetical, either.
We do not think, in the holy places; we think in bed, afterwards, whenthe glare, and the noise, and the confusion are gone, and in fancy werevisit alone, the solemn monuments of the past, and summon the phantompageants of an age that has passed away.
