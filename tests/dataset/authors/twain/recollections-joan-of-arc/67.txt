Condemned Yet Unafraid
TOWARD THE END of the ten-day interval the University of Paris renderedits decision concerning the Twelve Articles. By this finding, Joan wasguilty upon all the counts: she must renounce her errors and makesatisfaction, or be abandoned to the secular arm for punishment.
The University's mind was probably already made up before the Articleswere laid before it; yet it took it from the fifth to the eighteenth toproduce its verdict. I think the delay may have been caused by temporarydifficulties concerning two points:
1. As to who the fiends were who were represented in Joan's Voices; 2. Asto whether her saints spoke French only.
You understand, the University decided emphatically that it was fiendswho spoke in those Voices; it would need to prove that, and it did. Itfound out who those fiends were, and named them in the verdict: Belial,Satan, and Behemoth. This has always seemed a doubtful thing to me, andnot entitled to much credit. I think so for this reason: if theUniversity had actually known it was those three, it would for veryconsistency's sake have told how it knew it, and not stopped with themere assertion, since it had made Joan explain how she knew they were notfiends. Does not that seem reasonable? To my mind the University'sposition was weak, and I will tell you why. It had claimed that Joan'sangels were devils in disguise, and we all know that devils do disguisethemselves as angels; up to that point the University's position wasstrong; but you see yourself that it eats its own argument when it turnsaround and pretends that it can tell who such apparitions are, whiledenying the like ability to a person with as good a head on her shouldersas the best one the University could produce.
The doctors of the University had to see those creatures in order toknow; and if Joan was deceived, it is argument that they in their turncould also be deceived, for their insight and judgment were surely notclearer than hers.
As to the other point which I have thought may have proved a difficultyand cost the University delay, I will touch but a moment upon that, andpass on. The University decided that it was blasphemy for Joan to saythat her saints spoke French and not English, and were on the French sidein political sympathies. I think that the thing which troubled thedoctors of theology was this: they had decided that the three Voices wereSatan and two other devils; but they had also decided that these Voiceswere not on the French side--thereby tacitly asserting that they were onthe English side; and if on the English side, then they must be angelsand not devils. Otherwise, the situation was embarrassing. You see, theUniversity being the wisest and deepest and most erudite body in theworld, it would like to be logical if it could, for the sake of itsreputation; therefore it would study and study, days and days, trying tofind some good common-sense reason for proving the Voices to be devils inArticle No. 1 and proving them to be angels in Article No. 10. However,they had to give it up. They found no way out; and so, to this day, theUniversity's verdict remains just so--devils in No. 1, angels in No. 10;and no way to reconcile the discrepancy.
The envoys brought the verdict to Rouen, and with it a letter for Cauchonwhich was full of fervid praise. The University complimented him on hiszeal in hunting down this woman "whose venom had infected the faithful ofthe whole West," and as recompense it as good as promised him "a crown ofimperishable glory in heaven." Only that!--a crown in heaven; apromissory note and no indorser; always something away off yonder; not aword about the Archbishopric of Rouen, which was the thing Cauchon wasdestroying his soul for. A crown in heaven; it must have sounded like asarcasm to him, after all his hard work. What should he do in heaven? hedid not know anybody there.
On the nineteenth of May a court of fifty judges sat in thearchiepiscopal palace to discuss Joan's fate. A few wanted her deliveredover to the secular arm at once for punishment, but the rest insistedthat she be once more "charitably admonished" first.
So the same court met in the castle on the twenty-third, and Joan wasbrought to the bar. Pierre Maurice, a canon of Rouen, made a speech toJoan in which he admonished her to save her life and her soul byrenouncing her errors and surrendering to the Church. He finished with astern threat: if she remained obstinate the damnation of her soul wascertain, the destruction of her body probable. But Joan was immovable.She said:
"If I were under sentence, and saw the fire before me, and theexecutioner ready to light it--more, if I were in the fire itself, Iwould say none but the things which I have said in these trials; and Iwould abide by them till I died."
A deep silence followed now, which endured some moments. It lay upon melike a weight. I knew it for an omen. Then Cauchon, grave and solemn,turned to Pierre Maurice:
"Have you anything further to say?"
The priest bowed low, and said:
"Nothing, my lord."
"Prisoner at the bar, have you anything further to say?"
"Nothing."
"Then the debate is closed. To-morrow, sentence will be pronounced.Remove the prisoner."
She seemed to go from the place erect and noble. But I do not know; mysight was dim with tears.
To-morrow--twenty-fourth of May! Exactly a year since I saw her gospeeding across the plain at the head of her troops, her silver helmetshining, her silvery cape fluttering in the wind, her white plumesflowing, her sword held aloft; saw her charge the Burgundian camp threetimes, and carry it; saw her wheel to the right and spur for the duke'sreserves; saws her fling herself against it in the last assault she wasever to make. And now that fatal day was come again--and see what it wasbringing!
