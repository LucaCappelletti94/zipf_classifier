My Exquisite Poem Goes to Smash
WE OF the personal staff were in fairyland now, during the few days thatwe waited for the return of the army. We went into society. To our twoknights this was not a novelty, but to us young villagers it was a newand wonderful life. Any position of any sort near the person of the Maidof Vaucouleurs conferred high distinction upon the holder and caused hissociety to be courted; and so the D'Arc brothers, and Noel, and thePaladin, humble peasants at home, were gentlemen here, personages ofweight and influence. It was fine to see how soon their countrydiffidences and awkwardnesses melted away under this pleasant sun ofdeference and disappeared, and how lightly and easily they took to theirnew atmosphere. The Paladin was as happy as it was possible for any onein this earth to be. His tongue went all the time, and daily he got newdelight out of hearing himself talk. He began to enlarge his ancestry andspread it out all around, and ennoble it right and left, and it was notlong until it consisted almost entirely of dukes. He worked up his oldbattles and tricked them out with fresh splendors; also with new terrors,for he added artillery now. We had seen cannon for the first time atBlois--a few pieces--here there was plenty of it, and now and then we hadthe impressive spectacle of a huge English bastille hidden from sight ina mountain of smoke from its own guns, with lances of red flame dartingthrough it; and this grand picture, along with the quaking thunderspounding away in the heart of it, inflamed the Paladin's imagination andenabled him to dress out those ambuscade-skirmishes of ours with asublimity which made it impossible for any to recognize them at allexcept people who had not been there.
You may suspect that there was a special inspiration for these greatefforts of the Paladin's, and there was. It was the daughter of thehouse, Catherine Boucher, who was eighteen, and gentle and lovely in herways, and very beautiful. I think she might have been as beautiful asJoan herself, if she had had Joan's eyes. But that could never be. Therewas never but that one pair, there will never be another. Joan's eyeswere deep and rich and wonderful beyond anything merely earthly. Theyspoke all the languages--they had no need of words. They produced alleffects--and just by a glance, just a single glance; a glance that couldconvict a liar of his lie and make him confess it; that could bring downa proud man's pride and make him humble; that could put courage into acoward and strike dead the courage of the bravest; that could appeaseresentments and real hatreds; that could make the doubter believe and thehopeless hope again; that could purify the impure mind; that couldpersuade--ah, there it is--persuasion! that is the word; what or who isit that it couldn't persuade? The maniac of Domremy--the fairy-banishingpriest--the reverend tribunal of Toul--the doubting and superstitiousLaxart--the obstinate veteran of Vaucouleurs--the characterless heir ofFrance--the sages and scholars of the Parliament and University ofPoitiers--the darling of Satan, La Hire--the masterless Bastard ofOrleans, accustomed to acknowledge no way as right and rational but hisown--these were the trophies of that great gift that made her the wonderand mystery that she was.
We mingled companionably with the great folk who flocked to the big houseto make Joan's acquaintance, and they made much of us and we lived in theclouds, so to speak. But what we preferred even to this happiness was thequieter occasions, when the formal guests were gone and the family and afew dozen of its familiar friends were gathered together for a socialgood time. It was then that we did our best, we five youngsters, withsuch fascinations as we had, and the chief object of them was Catherine.None of us had ever been in love been in love before, and now we had themisfortune to all fall in love with the same person at the sametime--which was the first moment we saw her. She was a merry heart, andfull of life, and I still remember tenderly those few evenings that I waspermitted to have my share of her dear society and of comradeship withthat little company of charming people.
The Paladin made us all jealous the first night, for when he got fairlystarted on those battles of his he had everything to himself, and therewas no use in anybody else's trying to get any attention. Those peoplehad been living in the midst of real war for seven months; and to hearthis windy giant lay out his imaginary campaigns and fairly swim in bloodand spatter it all around, entertained them to the verge of the grave.Catherine was like to die, for pure enjoyment. She didn't laugh loud--we,of course, wished she would--but kept in the shelter of a fan, and shookuntil there was danger that she would unhitch her ribs from her spine.Then when the Paladin had got done with a battle and we began to feelthankful and hope for a change, she would speak up in a way that was sosweet and persuasive that it rankled in me, and ask him about some detailor other in the early part of his battle which she said had greatlyinterested her, and would he be so good as to describe that part againand with a little more particularity?--which of course precipitated thewhole battle on us, again, with a hundred lies added that had beenoverlooked before.
I do not know how to make you realize the pain I suffered. I had neverbeen jealous before, and it seemed intolerable that this creature shouldhave this good fortune which he was so ill entitled to, and I have to sitand see myself neglected when I was so longing for the least littleattention out of the thousand that this beloved girl was lavishing onhim. I was near her, and tried two or three times to get started on someof the things that I had done in those battles--and I felt ashamed ofmyself, too, for stooping to such a business--but she cared for nothingbut his battles, and could not be got to listen; and presently when oneof my attempts caused her to lose some precious rag or other of hismendacities and she asked him to repeat, thus bringing on a newengagement, of course, and increasing the havoc and carnage tenfold, Ifelt so humiliated by this pitiful miscarriage of mine that I gave up andtried no more.
The others were as outraged by the Paladin's selfish conduct as Iwas--and by his grand luck, too, of course--perhaps, indeed, that was themain hurt. We talked our trouble over together, which was natural, forrivals become brothers when a common affliction assails them and a commonenemy bears off the victory.
Each of us could do things that would please and get notice if it werenot for this person, who occupied all the time and gave others no chance.I had made a poem, taking a whole night to it--a poem in which I mosthappily and delicately celebrated that sweet girl's charms, withoutmentioning her name, but any one could see who was meant; for the baretitle--"The Rose of Orleans"--would reveal that, as it seemed to me. Itpictured this pure and dainty white rose as growing up out of the rudesoil of war and looking abroad out of its tender eyes upon the horridmachinery of death, and then--note this conceit--it blushes for thesinful nature of man, and turns red in a single night. Becomes a redrose, you see--a rose that was white before. The idea was my own, andquite new. Then it sent its sweet perfume out over the embattled city,and when the beleaguering forces smelt it they laid down their arms andwept. This was also my own idea, and new. That closed that part of thepoem; then I put her into the similitude of the firmament--not the wholeof it, but only part. That is to say, she was the moon, and all theconstellations were following her about, their hearts in flames for loveof her, but she would not halt, she would not listen, for 'twas thoughtshe loved another. 'Twas thought she loved a poor unworthy suppliant whowas upon the earth, facing danger, death, and possible mutilation in thebloody field, waging relentless war against a heartless foe to save herfrom an all too early grave, and her city from destruction. And when thesad pursuing constellations came to know and realize the bitter sorrowthat was come upon them --note this idea--their hearts broke and theirtears gushed forth, filling the vault of heaven with a fiery splendor,for those tears were falling stars. It was a rash idea, but beautiful;beautiful and pathetic; wonderfully pathetic, the way I had it, with therhyme and all to help. At the end of each verse there was a two-linerefrain pitying the poor earthly lover separated so far, and perhapsforever, from her he loved so well, and growing always paler and weakerand thinner in his agony as he neared the cruel grave--the most touchingthing--even the boys themselves could hardly keep back their tears, theway Noel said those lines. There were eight four-line stanzas in thefirst end of the poem--the end about the rose, the horticultural end, asyou may say, if that is not too large a name for such a little poem--andeight in the astronomical end--sixteen stanzas altogether, and I couldhave made it a hundred and fifty if I had wanted to, I was so inspiredand so all swelled up with beautiful thoughts and fancies; but that wouldhave been too many to sing or recite before a company that way, whereassixteen was just right, and could be done over again if desired. The boyswere amazed that I could make such a poem as that out of my own head, andso was I, of course, it being as much a surprise to me as it could be toanybody, for I did not know that it was in me. If any had asked me asingle day before if it was in me, I should have told them frankly no, itwas not.
That is the way with us; we may go on half of our life not knowing such athing is in us, when in reality it was there all the time, and all weneeded was something to turn up that would call for it. Indeed, it wasalways so without family. My grandfather had a cancer, and they neverknew what was the matter with him till he died, and he didn't knowhimself. It is wonderful how gifts and diseases can be concealed in thatway. All that was necessary in my case was for this lovely and inspiringgirl to cross my path, and out came the poem, and no more trouble to meto word it and rhyme it and perfect it than it is to stone a dog. No, Ishould have said it was not in me; but it was.
The boys couldn't say enough about it, they were so charmed andastonished. The thing that pleased them the most was the way it would dothe Paladin's business for him. They forgot everything in their anxietyto get him shelved and silenced. Noel Rainguesson was clear besidehimself with admiration of the poem, and wished he could do such a thing,but it was out of his line, and he couldn't, of course. He had it byheart in half an hour, and there was never anything so pathetic andbeautiful as the way he recited it. For that was just his gift--that andmimicry. He could recite anything better than anybody in the world, andhe could take of La Hire to the very life--or anybody else, for thatmatter. Now I never could recite worth a farthing; and when I tried withthis poem the boys wouldn't let me finish; they would nave nobody butNoel. So then, as I wanted the poem to make the best possible impressionon Catherine and the company, I told Noel he might do the reciting. Neverwas anybody so delighted. He could hardly believe that I was in earnest,but I was. I said that to have them know that I was the author of itwould be enough for me. The boys were full of exultation, and Noel saidif he could just get one chance at those people it would be all he wouldask; he would make them realize that there was something higher and finerthan war-lies to be had here.
But how to get the opportunity--that was the difficulty. We inventedseveral schemes that promised fairly, and at last we hit upon one thatwas sure. That was, to let the Paladin get a good start in a manufacturedbattle, and then send in a false call for him, and as soon as he was outof the room, have Noel take his place and finish the battle himself inthe Paladin's own style, imitated to a shade. That would get greatapplause, and win the house's favor and put it in the right mood to hearthe poem. The two triumphs together with finish theStandard-Bearer--modify him, anyway, to a certainty, and give the rest ofus a chance for the future.
So the next night I kept out of the way until the Paladin had got hisstart and was sweeping down upon the enemy like a whirlwind at the headof his corps, then I stepped within the door in my official uniform andannounced that a messenger from General La Hire's quarters desired speechwith the Standard-Bearer. He left the room, and Noel took his place andsaid that the interruption was to be deplored, but that fortunately hewas personally acquainted with the details of the battle himself, and ifpermitted would be glad to state them to the company. Then withoutwaiting for the permission he turned himself to the Paladin--a dwarfedPaladin, of course--with manner, tones, gestures, attitudes, everythingexact, and went right on with the battle, and it would be impossible toimagine a more perfectly and minutely ridiculous imitation than hefurnished to those shrieking people. They went into spasms, convulsions,frenzies of laughter, and the tears flowed down their cheeks in rivulets.The more they laughed, the more inspires Noel grew with his theme and thegreater marvels he worked, till really the laughter was not properlylaughing any more, but screaming. Blessedest feature of all, CatherineBoucher was dying with ecstasies, and presently there was little left ofher but gasps and suffocations. Victory? It was a perfect Agincourt.
The Paladin was gone only a couple of minutes; he found out at once thata trick had been played on him, so he came back. When he approached thedoor he heard Noel ranting in there and recognized the state of the case;so he remained near the door but out of sight, and heard the performancethrough to the end. The applause Noel got when he finished was wonderful;and they kept it up and kept it up, clapping their hands like mad, andshouting to him to do it over again.
But Noel was clever. He knew the very best background for a poem of deepand refined sentiment and pathetic melancholy was one where great andsatisfying merriment had prepared the spirit for the powerful contrast.
So he paused until all was quiet, then his face grew grave and assumed animpressive aspect, and at once all faces sobered in sympathy and took ona look of wondering and expectant interest. Now he began in a low butdistinct voice the opening verses of The Rose. As he breathed therhythmic measures forth, and one gracious line after another fell uponthose enchanted ears in that deep hush, one could catch, on every hand,half-audible ejaculations of "How lovely--how beautiful--how exquisite!"
By this time the Paladin, who had gone away for a moment with the openingof the poem, was back again, and had stepped within the door. He stoodthere now, resting his great frame against the wall and gazing toward thereciter like one entranced. When Noel got to the second part, and thatheart-breaking refrain began to melt and move all listeners, the Paladinbegan to wipe away tears with the back of first one hand and then theother. The next time the refrain was repeated he got to snuffling, andsort of half sobbing, and went to wiping his eyes with the sleeves of hisdoublet. He was so conspicuous that he embarrassed Noel a little, andalso had an ill effect upon the audience. With the next repetition hebroke quite down and began to cry like a calf, which ruined all theeffect and started many to the audience to laughing. Then he went on frombad to worse, until I never saw such a spectacle; for he fetched out atowel from under his doublet and began to swab his eyes with it and letgo the most infernal bellowings mixed up with sobbings and groanings andretchings and barkings and coughings and snortings and screamings andhowlings --and he twisted himself about on his heels and squirmed thisway and that, still pouring out that brutal clamor and flourishing histowel in the air and swabbing again and wringing it out. Hear? Youcouldn't hear yourself think. Noel was wholly drowned out and silenced,and those people were laughing the very lungs out of themselves. It wasthe most degrading sight that ever was. Now I heard the clankety-clankthat plate-armor makes when the man that is in it is running, and thenalongside my head there burst out the most inhuman explosion of laughterthat ever rent the drum of a person's ear, and I looked, and it was LaHire; and the stood there with his gauntlets on his hips and his headtilted back and his jaws spread to that degree to let out his hurricanesand his thunders that it amounted to indecent exposure, for you could seeeverything that was in him. Only one thing more and worse could happen,and it happened: at the other door I saw the flurry and bustle andbowings and scrapings of officials and flunkeys which means that somegreat personage is coming--then Joan of Arc stepped in, and the houserose! Yes, and tried to shut its indecorous mouth and make itself graveand proper; but when it saw the Maid herself go to laughing, it thankedGod for this mercy and the earthquake that followed.
Such things make a life of bitterness, and I do not wish to dwell uponthem. The effect of the poem was spoiled.
