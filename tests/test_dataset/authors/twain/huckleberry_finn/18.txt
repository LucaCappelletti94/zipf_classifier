When him and the old lady come down in the morn-ing all the family got up out of their chairs and givethem good-day, and didn't set down again till they hadset down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboardwhere the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bittersand handed it to him, and he held it in his hand andwaited till Tom's and Bob's was mixed, and then theybowed and said, "Our duty to you, sir, and madam;"and THEY bowed the least bit in the world and saidthank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob andTom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and themite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of theirtumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank tothe old people too.
Bob was the oldest and Tom next -- tall, beautifulmen with very broad shoulders and brown faces, andlong black hair and black eyes. They dressed in whitelinen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, andwore broad Panama hats.
Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and grand, but as good as shecould be when she warn't stirred up; but when shewas she had a look that would make you wilt in yourtracks, like her father. She was beautiful.
So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a differentkind. She was gentle and sweet like a dove, and shewas only twenty.
Each person had their own nigger to wait on them --Buck too. My nigger had a monstrous easy time, be-cause I warn't used to having anybody do anythingfor me, but Buck's was on the jump most of the time.
This was all there was of the family now, but thereused to be more -- three sons; they got killed; andEmmeline that died.
The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over ahundred niggers. Sometimes a stack of people wouldcome there, horseback, from ten or fifteen mile around,and stay five or six days, and have such junketingsround about and on the river, and dances and picnicsin the woods daytimes, and balls at the house nights.These people was mostly kinfolks of the family. Themen brought their guns with them. It was a hand-some lot of quality, I tell you.
There was another clan of aristocracy around there-- five or six families -- mostly of the name of Shep-herdson. They was as high-toned and well born andrich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords. TheShepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steam-boat landing, which was about two mile above ourhouse; so sometimes when I went up there with a lotof our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsonsthere on their fine horses.
One day Buck and me was away out in the woodshunting, and heard a horse coming. We was crossingthe road. Buck says:
"Quick! Jump for the woods!"
We done it, and then peeped down the woodsthrough the leaves. Pretty soon a splendid youngman come galloping down the road, setting his horseeasy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun acrosshis pommel. I had seen him before. It was youngHarney Shepherdson. I heard Buck's gun go off atmy ear, and Harney's hat tumbled off from his head.He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the placewhere we was hid. But we didn't wait. We startedthrough the woods on a run. The woods warn't thick,so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, andtwice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; andthen he rode away the way he come -- to get his hat,I reckon, but I couldn't see. We never stopped run-ning till we got home. The old gentleman's eyesblazed a minute -- 'twas pleasure, mainly, I judged --then his face sort of smoothed down, and he says,kind of gentle:
"I don't like that shooting from behind a bush.Why didn't you step into the road, my boy?"
"The Shepherdsons don't, father. They alwaystake advantage."
Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queenwhile Buck was telling his tale, and her nostrils spreadand her eyes snapped. The two young men lookeddark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she turnedpale, but the color come back when she found theman warn't hurt.
Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribsunder the trees by ourselves, I says:
"Did you want to kill him, Buck?"
"Well, I bet I did."
"What did he do to you?"
"Him? He never done nothing to me."
"Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?"
"Why, nothing -- only it's on account of the feud."
"What's a feud?"
"Why, where was you raised? Don't you knowwhat a feud is?"
"Never heard of it before -- tell me about it."
"Well," says Buck, "a feud is this way: A manhas a quarrel with another man, and kills him; thenthat other man's brother kills HIM; then the otherbrothers, on both sides, goes for one another; thenthe COUSINS chip in -- and by and by everybody's killedoff, and there ain't no more feud. But it's kind ofslow, and takes a long time."
"Has this one been going on long, Buck?"
"Well, I should RECKON! It started thirty year ago,or som'ers along there. There was trouble 'boutsomething, and then a lawsuit to settle it; and thesuit went agin one of the men, and so he up and shotthe man that won the suit -- which he would naturallydo, of course. Anybody would."
"What was the trouble about, Buck? -- land?"
"I reckon maybe -- I don't know."
"Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Granger-ford or a Shepherdson?"
"Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago."
"Don't anybody know?"
"Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of theother old people; but they don't know now what therow was about in the first place."
"Has there been many killed, Buck?"
"Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But theydon't always kill. Pa's got a few buckshot in him;but he don't mind it 'cuz he don't weigh much, any-way. Bob's been carved up some with a bowie, andTom's been hurt once or twice."
"Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?"
"Yes; we got one and they got one. 'Bout threemonths ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, wasriding through the woods on t'other side of the river,and didn't have no weapon with him, which was blame'foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horsea-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdsona-linkin' after him with his gun in his hand and hiswhite hair a-flying in the wind; and 'stead of jumpingoff and taking to the brush, Bud 'lowed he could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile ormore, the old man a-gaining all the time; so at lastBud seen it warn't any use, so he stopped and facedaround so as to have the bullet holes in front, youknow, and the old man he rode up and shot himdown. But he didn't git much chance to enjoy hisluck, for inside of a week our folks laid HIM out."
"I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck."
"I reckon he WARN'T a coward. Not by a blame'sight. There ain't a coward amongst them Shepherd-sons -- not a one. And there ain't no cowards amongstthe Grangerfords either. Why, that old man kep' uphis end in a fight one day for half an hour againstthree Grangerfords, and come out winner. They wasall a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behinda little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stopthe bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on theirhorses and capered around the old man, and pepperedaway at him, and he peppered away at them. Himand his horse both went home pretty leaky and crip-pled, but the Grangerfords had to be FETCHED home --and one of 'em was dead, and another died the nextday. No, sir; if a body's out hunting for cowards hedon't want to fool away any time amongst them Shep-herdsons, becuz they don't breed any of that KIND."
Next Sunday we all went to church, about threemile, everybody a-horseback. The men took theirguns along, so did Buck, and kept them between theirknees or stood them handy against the wall. TheShepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornerypreaching -- all about brotherly love, and such-liketiresomeness; but everybody said it was a good ser-mon, and they all talked it over going home, and hadsuch a powerful lot to say about faith and good worksand free grace and preforeordestination, and I don'tknow what all, that it did seem to me to be one of theroughest Sundays I had run across yet.
About an hour after dinner everybody was dozingaround, some in their chairs and some in their rooms,and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog wasstretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. Iwent up to our room, and judged I would take a napmyself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing inher door, which was next to ours, and she took me inher room and shut the door very soft, and asked me ifI liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if Iwould do something for her and not tell anybody,and I said I would. Then she said she'd forgot herTestament, and left it in the seat at church between twoother books, and would I slip out quiet and go thereand fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. Isaid I would. So I slid out and slipped off up theroad, and there warn't anybody at the church, exceptmaybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on thedoor, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-timebecause it's cool. If you notice, most folks don't goto church only when they've got to; but a hog isdifferent.
Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't naturalfor a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament.So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece ofpaper with "HALF-PAST TWO" wrote on it with a pencil.I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. Icouldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paperin the book again, and when I got home and upstairsthere was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me.She pulled me in and shut the door; then she lookedin the Testament till she found the paper, and as soonas she read it she looked glad; and before a bodycould think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze,and said I was the best boy in the world, and not totell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for aminute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made herpowerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, butwhen I got my breath I asked her what the paper wasabout, and she asked me if I had read it, and I saidno, and she asked me if I could read writing, and Itold her "no, only coarse-hand," and then she saidthe paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keepher place, and I might go and play now.
I went off down to the river, studying over thisthing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger wasfollowing along behind. When we was out of sight ofthe house he looked back and around a second, andthen comes a-running, and says:
"Mars Jawge, if you'll come down into de swampI'll show you a whole stack o' water-moccasins."
Thinks I, that's mighty curious; he said that yester-day. He oughter know a body don't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them.What is he up to, anyway? So I says:
"All right; trot ahead."
I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over theswamp, and waded ankle deep as much as anotherhalf-mile. We come to a little flat piece of land whichwas dry and very thick with trees and bushes andvines, and he says:
"You shove right in dah jist a few steps, MarsJawge; dah's whah dey is. I's seed 'm befo'; Idon't k'yer to see 'em no mo'."
Then he slopped right along and went away, andpretty soon the trees hid him. I poked into the placea-ways and come to a little open patch as big as abedroom all hung around with vines, and found a manlaying there asleep -- and, by jings, it was my old Jim!
I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to bea grand surprise to him to see me again, but it warn't.He nearly cried he was so glad, but he warn't sur-prised. Said he swum along behind me that night,and heard me yell every time, but dasn't answer, be-cause he didn't want nobody to pick HIM up and takehim into slavery again. Says he:
"I got hurt a little, en couldn't swim fas', so I wuza considable ways behine you towards de las'; whenyou landed I reck'ned I could ketch up wid you on delan' 'dout havin' to shout at you, but when I see dathouse I begin to go slow. I 'uz off too fur to hearwhat dey say to you -- I wuz 'fraid o' de dogs; butwhen it 'uz all quiet agin I knowed you's in de house,so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Earlyin de mawnin' some er de niggers come along, gwyneto de fields, en dey tuk me en showed me dis place,whah de dogs can't track me on accounts o' de water,en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en tells mehow you's a-gitt'n along."
"Why didn't you tell my Jack to fetch me heresooner, Jim?"
"Well, 'twarn't no use to 'sturb you, Huck, tell wecould do sumfn -- but we's all right now. I ben a-buyin' pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin' up de raf' nights when --"
"WHAT raft, Jim?"
"Our ole raf'."
"You mean to say our old raft warn't smashed allto flinders?"
"No, she warn't. She was tore up a good deal --one en' of her was; but dey warn't no great harmdone, on'y our traps was mos' all los'. Ef we hadn'dive' so deep en swum so fur under water, en de nighthadn' ben so dark, en we warn't so sk'yerd, en bensich punkin-heads, as de sayin' is, we'd a seed de raf'.But it's jis' as well we didn't, 'kase now she's all fixedup agin mos' as good as new, en we's got a new lot o'stuff, in de place o' what 'uz los'."
"Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim-- did you catch her?"
"How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods?No; some er de niggers foun' her ketched on a snagalong heah in de ben', en dey hid her in a crick'mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin' 'boutwhich un 'um she b'long to de mos' dat I come toheah 'bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de troubleby tellin' 'um she don't b'long to none uv um, but toyou en me; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a youngwhite genlman's propaty, en git a hid'n for it? Den Igin 'm ten cents apiece, en dey 'uz mighty well satis-fied, en wisht some mo' raf's 'ud come along en make'm rich agin. Dey's mighty good to me, dese niggersis, en whatever I wants 'm to do fur me I doan' haveto ast 'm twice, honey. Dat Jack's a good nigger, enpooty smart."
"Yes, he is. He ain't ever told me you was here;told me to come, and he'd show me a lot of water-moccasins. If anything happens HE ain't mixed up init. He can say he never seen us together, and it 'llbe the truth."
I don't want to talk much about the next day. Ireckon I'll cut it pretty short. I waked up aboutdawn, and was a-going to turn over and go to sleepagain when I noticed how still it was -- didn't seemto be anybody stirring. That warn't usual. Next Inoticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up,a-wondering, and goes down stairs -- nobody around;everything as still as a mouse. Just the same outside.Thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says:
"What's it all about?"
Says he:
"Don't you know, Mars Jawge?"
"No," says I, "I don't."
"Well, den, Miss Sophia's run off! 'deed she has.She run off in de night some time -- nobody don'tknow jis' when; run off to get married to dat youngHarney Shepherdson, you know -- leastways, so dey'spec. De fambly foun' it out 'bout half an hourago -- maybe a little mo' -- en' I TELL you dey warn'tno time los'. Sich another hurryin' up guns en hossesYOU never see! De women folks has gone for to stirup de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck deyguns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch datyoung man en kill him 'fo' he kin git acrost de riverwid Miss Sophia. I reck'n dey's gwyne to be mightyrough times."
"Buck went off 'thout waking me up."
"Well, I reck'n he DID! Dey warn't gwyne to mixyou up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en'lowed he's gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson orbust. Well, dey'll be plenty un 'm dah, I reck'n, enyou bet you he'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst."
I took up the river road as hard as I could put. Byand by I begin to hear guns a good ways off. WhenI came in sight of the log store and the woodpilewhere the steamboats lands I worked along under thetrees and brush till I got to a good place, and then Iclumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was outof reach, and watched. There was a wood-rank fourfoot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first Iwas going to hide behind that; but maybe it wasluckier I didn't.
There was four or five men cavorting around on theirhorses in the open place before the log store, cussingand yelling, and trying to get at a couple of youngchaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside ofthe steamboat landing; but they couldn't come it.Every time one of them showed himself on the riverside of the woodpile he got shot at. The two boyswas squatting back to back behind the pile, so theycould watch both ways.
By and by the men stopped cavorting around andyelling. They started riding towards the store; thenup gets one of the boys, draws a steady bead over thewood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle.All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed thehurt one and started to carry him to the store; andthat minute the two boys started on the run. Theygot half way to the tree I was in before the mennoticed. Then the men see them, and jumped ontheir horses and took out after them. They gained onthe boys, but it didn't do no good, the boys had toogood a start; they got to the woodpile that was infront of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so theyhad the bulge on the men again. One of the boyswas Buck, and the other was a slim young chap aboutnineteen years old.
The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away.As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buckand told him. He didn't know what to make of myvoice coming out of the tree at first. He was awfulsurprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let himknow when the men come in sight again; said theywas up to some devilment or other -- wouldn't be gonelong. I wished I was out of that tree, but I dasn'tcome down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and 'lowedthat him and his cousin Joe (that was the other youngchap) would make up for this day yet. He said hisfather and his two brothers was killed, and two orthree of the enemy. Said the Shepherdsons laid forthem in ambush. Buck said his father and brothersought to waited for their relations -- the Shepherdsonswas too strong for them. I asked him what was be-come of young Harney and Miss Sophia. He saidthey'd got across the river and was safe. I was gladof that; but the way Buck did take on because hedidn't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him-- I hain't ever heard anything like it.
All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three orfour guns -- the men had slipped around through thewoods and come in from behind without their horses!The boys jumped for the river -- both of them hurt --and as they swum down the current the men run alongthe bank shooting at them and singing out, "Killthem, kill them!" It made me so sick I most fell outof the tree. I ain't a-going to tell ALL that happened --it would make me sick again if I was to do that. Iwished I hadn't ever come ashore that night to seesuch things. I ain't ever going to get shut of them --lots of times I dream about them.
I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraidto come down. Sometimes I heard guns away off inthe woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men galloppast the log store with guns; so I reckoned the troublewas still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so Imade up my mind I wouldn't ever go anear that houseagain, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow.I judged that that piece of paper meant that MissSophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-pasttwo and run off; and I judged I ought to told herfather about that paper and the curious way she acted,and then maybe he would a locked her up, and thisawful mess wouldn't ever happened.
When I got down out of the tree I crept along downthe river bank a piece, and found the two bodies layingin the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I gotthem ashore; then I covered up their faces, and gotaway as quick as I could. I cried a little when I wascovering up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.
It was just dark now. I never went near the house,but struck through the woods and made for theswamp. Jim warn't on his island, so I tramped off ina hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows,red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awfulcountry. The raft was gone! My souls, but I wasscared! I couldn't get my breath for most a minute.Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five footfrom me says:
"Good lan'! is dat you, honey? Doan' make nonoise."
It was Jim's voice -- nothing ever sounded so goodbefore. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard,and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so gladto see me. He says:
"Laws bless you, chile, I 'uz right down sho' you'sdead agin. Jack's been heah; he say he reck'n you'sben shot, kase you didn' come home no mo'; so I'sjes' dis minute a startin' de raf' down towards de moufer de crick, so's to be all ready for to shove out enleave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certainyou IS dead. Lawsy, I's mighty glad to git you backagain, honey.
I says:
"All right -- that's mighty good; they won't findme, and they'll think I've been killed, and floated downthe river -- there's something up there that 'll help themthink so -- so don't you lose no time, Jim, but justshove off for the big water as fast as ever you can."
I never felt easy till the raft was two mile belowthere and out in the middle of the Mississippi. Thenwe hung up our signal lantern, and judged that we wasfree and safe once more. I hadn't had a bite to eatsince yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgersand buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens --there ain't nothing in the world so good when it'scooked right -- and whilst I eat my supper we talkedand had a good time. I was powerful glad to getaway from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away fromthe swamp. We said there warn't no home like araft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped upand smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty freeand easy and comfortable on a raft.
