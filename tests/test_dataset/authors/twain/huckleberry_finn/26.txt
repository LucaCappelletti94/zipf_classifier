So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed themtheir rooms, which was plain but nice. She said she'dhave her frocks and a lot of other traps took out ofher room if they was in Uncle Harvey's way, but hesaid they warn't. The frocks was hung along the wall,and before them was a curtain made out of calico thathung down to the floor. There was an old hair trunkin one corner, and a guitar-box in another, and allsorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, likegirls brisken up a room with. The king said it was allthe more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings,and so don't disturb them. The duke's room waspretty small, but plenty good enough, and so was mycubby.
That night they had a big supper, and all them menand women was there, and I stood behind the king andthe duke's chairs and waited on them, and the niggerswaited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the head ofthe table, with Susan alongside of her, and said howbad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was,and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was --and all that kind of rot, the way women always do forto force out compliments; and the people all knowedeverything was tiptop, and said so -- said "How DOyou get biscuits to brown so nice?" and "Where, forthe land's sake, DID you get these amaz'n pickles?"and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the waypeople always does at a supper, you know.
And when it was all done me and the hare-lip hadsupper in the kitchen off of the leavings, whilst the otherswas helping the niggers clean up the things. Thehare-lip she got to pumping me about England, andblest if I didn't think the ice was getting mighty thinsometimes. She says:
"Did you ever see the king?"
"Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have -- hegoes to our church." I knowed he was dead yearsago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes toour church, she says:
"What -- regular?"
"Yes -- regular. His pew's right over oppositeourn -- on t'other side the pulpit."
"I thought he lived in London?"
"Well, he does. Where WOULD he live?"
"But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield?"
I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to getchoked with a chicken bone, so as to get time to thinkhow to get down again. Then I says:
"I mean he goes to our church regular when he's inSheffield. That's only in the summer time, when hecomes there to take the sea baths."
"Why, how you talk -- Sheffield ain't on the sea."
"Well, who said it was?"
"Why, you did."
"I DIDN'T nuther."
"You did!"
"I didn't."
"You did."
"I never said nothing of the kind."
"Well, what DID you say, then?"
"Said he come to take the sea BATHS -- that's what Isaid."
"Well, then, how's he going to take the sea baths ifit ain't on the sea?"
"Looky here," I says; "did you ever see anyCongress-water?"
"Yes."
"Well, did you have to go to Congress to getit?"
"Why, no."
"Well, neither does William Fourth have to go tothe sea to get a sea bath."
"How does he get it, then?"
"Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water -- in barrels. There in the palace at Sheffieldthey've got furnaces, and he wants his water hot.They can't bile that amount of water away off there atthe sea. They haven't got no conveniences for it."
"Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the firstplace and saved time."
When she said that I see I was out of the woodsagain, and so I was comfortable and glad. Next, shesays:
"Do you go to church, too?"
"Yes -- regular."
"Where do you set?"
"Why, in our pew."
"WHOSE pew?"
"Why, OURN -- your Uncle Harvey's."
"His'n? What does HE want with a pew?"
"Wants it to set in. What did you RECKON he wantedwith it?"
"Why, I thought he'd be in the pulpit."
Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I wasup a stump again, so I played another chicken boneand got another think. Then I says:
"Blame it, do you suppose there ain't but onepreacher to a church?"
"Why, what do they want with more?"
"What! -- to preach before a king? I never didsee such a girl as you. They don't have no less thanseventeen."
"Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn't set outsuch a string as that, not if I NEVER got to glory. Itmust take 'em a week."
"Shucks, they don't ALL of 'em preach the sameday -- only ONE of 'em."
"Well, then, what does the rest of 'em do?"
"Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate-- and one thing or another. But mainly they don'tdo nothing."
"Well, then, what are they FOR?"
"Why, they're for STYLE. Don't you know noth-ing?"
"Well, I don't WANT to know no such foolishness asthat. How is servants treated in England? Do theytreat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers?"
"NO! A servant ain't nobody there. They treatthem worse than dogs."
"Don't they give 'em holidays, the way we do,Christmas and New Year's week, and Fourth of July?"
"Oh, just listen! A body could tell YOU hain't everbeen to England by that. Why, Hare-l -- why, Joanna,they never see a holiday from year's end to year'send; never go to the circus, nor theater, nor niggershows, nor nowheres."
"Nor church?"
"Nor church."
"But YOU always went to church."
Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the oldman's servant. But next minute I whirled in on akind of an explanation how a valley was different froma common servant and HAD to go to church whetherhe wanted to or not, and set with the family, on ac-count of its being the law. But I didn't do it prettygood, and when I got done I see she warn't satisfied.She says:
"Honest injun, now, hain't you been telling me alot of lies?"
"Honest injun," says I.
"None of it at all?"
"None of it at all. Not a lie in it," says I.
"Lay your hand on this book and say it."
I see it warn't nothing but a dictionary, so I laid myhand on it and said it. So then she looked a littlebetter satisfied, and says:
"Well, then, I'll believe some of it; but I hope togracious if I'll believe the rest."
"What is it you won't believe, Joe?" says MaryJane, stepping in with Susan behind her. "It ain'tright nor kind for you to talk so to him, and him astranger and so far from his people. How would youlike to be treated so?"
"That's always your way, Maim -- always sailing into help somebody before they're hurt. I hain't donenothing to him. He's told some stretchers, I reckon,and I said I wouldn't swallow it all; and that's everybit and grain I DID say. I reckon he can stand a littlething like that, can't he?"
"I don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twasbig; he's here in our house and a stranger, and itwasn't good of you to say it. If you was in his placeit would make you feel ashamed; and so you oughtn'tto say a thing to another person that will make THEMfeel ashamed."
"Why, Maim, he said --"
"It don't make no difference what he SAID -- thatain't the thing. The thing is for you to treat himKIND, and not be saying things to make him rememberhe ain't in his own country and amongst his ownfolks."
I says to myself, THIS is a girl that I'm letting thatold reptle rob her of her money!
Then Susan SHE waltzed in; and if you'll believeme, she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!
Says I to myself, and this is ANOTHER one that I'mletting him rob her of her money!
Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and wentin sweet and lovely again -- which was her way; butwhen she got done there warn't hardly anything left o'poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.
"All right, then," says the other girls; "you justask his pardon."
She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. Shedone it so beautiful it was good to hear; and I wishedI could tell her a thousand lies, so she could do itagain.
I says to myself, this is ANOTHER one that I'm lettinghim rob her of her money. And when she got throughthey all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel athome and know I was amongst friends. I felt soornery and low down and mean that I says to myself,my mind's made up; I'll hive that money for them orbust.
So then I lit out -- for bed, I said, meaning sometime or another. When I got by myself I went tothinking the thing over. I says to myself, shall I goto that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?No -- that won't do. He might tell who told him;then the king and the duke would make it warm forme. Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane? No --I dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint,sure; they've got the money, and they'd slide rightout and get away with it. If she was to fetch in helpI'd get mixed up in the business before it was donewith, I judge. No; there ain't no good way but one.I got to steal that money, somehow; and I got tosteal it some way that they won't suspicion that I doneit. They've got a good thing here, and they ain'ta-going to leave till they've played this family and thistown for all they're worth, so I'll find a chance timeenough. I'll steal it and hide it; and by and by,when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter andtell Mary Jane where it's hid. But I better hive it to-night if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn't let upas much as he lets on he has; he might scare themout of here yet.
So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms. Up-stairs the hall was dark, but I found the duke's room,and started to paw around it with my hands; but Irecollected it wouldn't be much like the king to letanybody else take care of that money but his own self;so then I went to his room and begun to paw aroundthere. But I see I couldn't do nothing without acandle, and I dasn't light one, of course. So I judgedI'd got to do the other thing -- lay for them andeavesdrop. About that time I hears their footstepscoming, and was going to skip under the bed; Ireached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it wouldbe; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane'sfrocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled inamongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.
They come in and shut the door; and the first thingthe duke done was to get down and look under thebed. Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed when Iwanted it. And yet, you know, it's kind of natural tohide under the bed when you are up to anythingprivate. They sets down then, and the king says:
"Well, what is it? And cut it middlin' short, be-cause it's better for us to be down there a-whoopin'up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a chance totalk us over."
"Well, this is it, Capet. I ain't easy; I ain't com-fortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted toknow your plans. I've got a notion, and I think it's asound one."
"What is it, duke?"
"That we better glide out of this before three in themorning, and clip it down the river with what we'vegot. Specially, seeing we got it so easy -- GIVEN backto us, flung at our heads, as you may say, when ofcourse we allowed to have to steal it back. I'm forknocking off and lighting out."
That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour ortwo ago it would a been a little different, but now itmade me feel bad and disappointed, The king rips outand says:
"What! And not sell out the rest o' the property?March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or ninethous'n' dollars' worth o' property layin' around jestsufferin' to be scooped in? -- and all good, salablestuff, too."
The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold wasenough, and he didn't want to go no deeper -- didn'twant to rob a lot of orphans of EVERYTHING they had.
"Why, how you talk!" says the king. "Wesha'n't rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money.The people that BUYS the property is the suff'rers;because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't ownit -- which won't be long after we've slid -- the salewon't be valid, and it 'll all go back to the estate.These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin, andthat's enough for THEM; they're young and spry, andk'n easy earn a livin'. THEY ain't a-goin to suffer.Why, jest think -- there's thous'n's and thous'n's thatain't nigh so well off. Bless you, THEY ain't got noth'n'to complain of."
Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last hegive in, and said all right, but said he believed it wasblamed foolishness to stay, and that doctor hangingover them. But the king says:
"Cuss the doctor! What do we k'yer for HIM?Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side? Andain't that a big enough majority in any town?"
So they got ready to go down stairs again. Theduke says:
"I don't think we put that money in a good place."
That cheered me up. I'd begun to think I warn'tgoing to get a hint of no kind to help me. The kingsays:
"Why?"
"Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from thisout; and first you know the nigger that does up therooms will get an order to box these duds up and put'em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run acrossmoney and not borrow some of it?"
"Your head's level agin, duke," says the king; andhe comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or threefoot from where I was. I stuck tight to the wall andkept mighty still, though quivery; and I wonderedwhat them fellows would say to me if they catchedme; and I tried to think what I'd better do if they didcatch me. But the king he got the bag before I couldthink more than about a half a thought, and he neversuspicioned I was around. They took and shoved thebag through a rip in the straw tick that was under thefeather-bed, and crammed it in a foot or two amongstthe straw and said it was all right now, because anigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don't turnover the straw tick only about twice a year, and so itwarn't in no danger of getting stole now.
But I knowed better. I had it out of there beforethey was half-way down stairs. I groped along up tomy cubby, and hid it there till I could get a chanceto do better. I judged I better hide it outside of thehouse somewheres, because if they missed it they wouldgive the house a good ransacking: I knowed that verywell. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but Icouldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted to, I was insuch a sweat to get through with the business. Byand by I heard the king and the duke come up; so Irolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top ofmy ladder, and waited to see if anything was going tohappen. But nothing did.
So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and theearly ones hadn't begun yet; and then I slipped downthe ladder.
