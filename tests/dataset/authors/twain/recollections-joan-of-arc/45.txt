Again to Arms
NOW THESE were nobles, you know, by decree of the King!--these preciousold infants. But they did not realize it; they could not be calledconscious of it; it was an abstraction, a phantom; to them it had nosubstance; their minds could not take hold of it. No, they did not botherabout their nobility; they lived in their horses. The horses were solid;they were visible facts, and would make a mighty stir in Domremy.Presently something was said about the Coronation, and old D'Arc said itwas going to be a grand thing to be able to say, when they got home, thatthey were present in the very town itself when it happened. Joan lookedtroubled, and said:
"Ah, that reminds me. You were here and you didn't send me word. In thetown, indeed! Why, you could have sat with the other nobles, and benwelcome; and could have looked upon the crowning itself, and carried thathome to tell. Ah, why did you use me so, and send me no word?"
The old father was embarrassed, now, quite visibly embarrassed, and hadthe air of one who does not quite know what to say. But Joan was lookingup in his face, her hands upon his shoulders--waiting. He had to speak;so presently he drew her to his breast, which was heaving with emotion;and he said, getting out his words with difficulty:
"There, hide your face, child, and let your old father humble himself andmake his confession. I--I--don't you see, don't you understand?--I couldnot know that these grandeurs would not turn your young head--it would beonly natural. I might shame you before these great per--"
"Father!"
"And then I was afraid, as remembering that cruel thing I said once in mysinful anger. Oh, appointed of God to be a soldier, and the greatest inthe land! and in my ignorant anger I said I would drown you with my ownhands if you unsexed yourself and brought shame to your name and family.Ah, how could I ever have said it, and you so good and dear and innocent!I was afraid; for I was guilty. You understand it now, my child, and youforgive?"
Do you see? Even that poor groping old land-crab, with his skull full ofpulp, had pride. Isn't it wonderful? And more--he had conscience; he hada sense of right and wrong, such as it was; he was able to find remorse.It looks impossible, it looks incredible, but it is not. I believe thatsome day it will be found out that peasants are people. Yes, beings in agreat many respects like ourselves. And I believe that some day they willfind this out, too--and then! Well, then I think they will rise up anddemand to be regarded as part of the race, and that by consequence therewill be trouble. Whenever one sees in a book or in a king's proclamationthose words "the nation," they bring before us the upper classes; onlythose; we know no other "nation"; for us and the kings no other "nation"exists. But from the day that I saw old D'Arc the peasant acting andfeeling just as I should have acted and felt myself, I have carried theconviction in my heart that our peasants are not merely animals, beastsof burden put here by the good God to produce food and comfort for the"nation," but something more and better. You look incredulous. Well, thatis your training; it is the training of everybody; but as for me, I thankthat incident for giving me a better light, and I have never forgottenit.
Let me see--where was I? One's mind wanders around here and there andyonder, when one is old. I think I said Joan comforted him. Certainly,that is what she would do--there was no need to say that. She coaxed himand petted him and caressed him, and laid the memory of that old hardspeech of his to rest. Laid it to rest until she should be dead. Then hewould remember it again--yes, yes! Lord, how those things sting, andburn, and gnaw--the things which we did against the innocent dead! And wesay in our anguish, "If they could only come back!" Which is all verywell to say, but, as far as I can see, it doesn't profit anything. In myopinion the best way is not to do the thing in the first place. And I amnot alone in this; I have heard our two knights say the same thing; and aman there in Orleans--no, I believe it was at Beaugency, or one of thoseplaces--it seems more as if it was at Beaugency than the others--this mansaid the same thing exactly; almost the same words; a dark man with acast in his eye and one leg shorter than the other. His name was--was--itis singular that I can't call that man's name; I had it in my mind only amoment ago, and I know it begins with--no, I don't remember what itbegins with; but never mind, let it go; I will think of it presently, andthen I will tell you.
Well, pretty soon the old father wanted to know how Joan felt when shewas in the thick of a battle, with the bright blades hacking and flashingall around her, and the blows rapping and slatting on her shield, andblood gushing on her from the cloven ghastly face and broken teeth of theneighbor at her elbow, and the perilous sudden back surge of massedhorses upon a person when the front ranks give way before a heavy rush ofthe enemy, and men tumble limp and groaning out of saddles all around,and battle-flags falling from dead hands wipe across one's face and hidethe tossing turmoil a moment, and in the reeling and swaying and laboringjumble one's horse's hoofs sink into soft substances and shrieks of painrespond, and presently--panic! rush! swarm! flight! and death and hellfollowing after! And the old fellow got ever so much excited; and strodeup and down, his tongue going like a mill, asking question after questionand never waiting for an answer; and finally he stood Joan up in themiddle of the room and stepped off and scanned her critically, and said:
"No--I don't understand it. You are so little. So little and slender.When you had your armor on, to-day, it gave one a sort of notion of it;but in these pretty silks and velvets, you are only a dainty page, not aleague-striding war-colossus, moving in clouds and darkness and breathingsmoke and thunder. I would God I might see you at it and go tell yourmother! That would help her sleep, poor thing! Here--teach me the arts ofthe soldier, that I may explain them to her."
And she did it. She gave him a pike, and put him through the manual ofarms; and made him do the steps, too. His marching was incredibly awkwardand slovenly, and so was his drill with the pike; but he didn't know it,and was wonderfully pleased with himself, and mightily excited andcharmed with the ringing, crisp words of command. I am obliged to saythat if looking proud and happy when one is marching were sufficient, hewould have been the perfect soldier.
And he wanted a lesson in sword-play, and got it. But of course that wasbeyond him; he was too old. It was beautiful to see Joan handle thefoils, but the old man was a bad failure. He was afraid of the things,and skipped and dodged and scrambled around like a woman who has lost hermind on account of the arrival of a bat. He was of no good as anexhibition. But if La Hire had only come in, that would have been anothermatter. Those two fenced often; I saw them many times. True, Joan waseasily his master, but it made a good show for all that, for La Hire wasa grand swordsman. What a swift creature Joan was! You would see herstanding erect with her ankle-bones together and her foil arched over herhead, the hilt in one hand and the button in the other--the old generalopposite, bent forward, left hand reposing on his back, his foiladvanced, slightly wiggling and squirming, his watching eye boringstraight into hers--and all of a sudden she would give a spring forward,and back again; and there she was, with the foil arched over her head asbefore. La Hire had been hit, but all that the spectator saw of it was asomething like a thin flash of light in the air, but nothing distinct,nothing definite.
We kept the drinkables moving, for that would please the Bailly and thelandlord; and old Laxart and D'Arc got to feeling quite comfortable, butwithout being what you could call tipsy. They got out the presents whichthey had been buying to carry home--humble things and cheap, but theywould be fine there, and welcome. And they gave to Joan a present fromPere Fronte and one from her mother--the one a little leaden image of theHoly Virgin, the other half a yard of blue silk ribbon; and she was aspleased as a child; and touched, too, as one could see plainly enough.Yes, she kissed those poor things over and over again, as if they hadbeen something costly and wonderful; and she pinned the Virgin on herdoublet, and sent for her helmet and tied the ribbon on that; first oneway, then another; then a new way, then another new way; and with eacheffort perching the helmet on her hand and holding it off this way andthat, and canting her head to one side and then the other, examining theeffect, as a bird does when it has got a new bug. And she said she couldalmost wish she was going to the wars again; for then she would fightwith the better courage, as having always with her something which hermother's touch had blessed.
Old Laxart said he hoped she would go to the wars again, but home first,for that all the people there were cruel anxious to see her--and so hewent on:
"They are proud of you, dear. Yes, prouder than any village ever was ofanybody before. And indeed it is right and rational; for it is the firsttime a village has ever had anybody like you to be proud of and call itsown. And it is strange and beautiful how they try to give your name toevery creature that has a sex that is convenient. It is but half a yearsince you began to be spoken of and left us, and so it is surprising tosee how many babies there are already in that region that are named foryou. First it was just Joan; then it was Joan-Orleans; thenJoan-Orleans-Beaugency-Patay; and now the next ones will have a lot oftowns and the Coronation added, of course. Yes, and the animals the same.They know how you love animals, and so they try to do you honor and showtheir love for you by naming all those creatures after you; insomuch thatif a body should step out and call "Joan of Arc--come!" there would be alandslide of cats and all such things, each supposing it was the onewanted, and all willing to take the benefit of the doubt, anyway, for thesake of the food that might be on delivery. The kitten you leftbehind--the last stray you fetched home--bears you name, now, and belongsto Pere Fronte, and is the pet and pride of the village; and people havecome miles to look at it and pet it and stare at it and wonder over itbecause it was Joan of Arc's cat. Everybody will tell you that; and oneday when a stranger threw a stone at it, not knowing it was your cat, thevillage rose against him as one man and hanged him! And but for PereFronte--"
There was an interruption. It was a messenger from the King, bearing anote for Joan, which I read to her, saying he had reflected, and hadconsulted his other generals, and was obliged to ask her to remain at thehead of the army and withdraw her resignation. Also, would she comeimmediately and attend a council of war? Straightway, at a littledistance, military commands and the rumble of drums broke on the stillnight, and we knew that her guard was approaching.
Deep disappointment clouded her face for just one moment and no more--itpassed, and with it the homesick girl, and she was Joan of Arc,Commander-in-Chief again, and ready for duty.
