The old saw says, "Let a sleeping dog lie." Right.... Still, when thereis much at stake it is better to get a newspaper to do it. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
FROM DIARY:
January 28. I learned of an official Thug-book the other day. I wasnot aware before that there was such a thing. I am allowed the temporaryuse of it. We are making preparations for travel. Mainly thepreparations are purchases of bedding. This is to be used in sleepingberths in the trains; in private houses sometimes; and in nine-tenths ofthe hotels. It is not realizable; and yet it is true. It is a survival;an apparently unnecessary thing which in some strange way has outlivedthe conditions which once made it necessary. It comes down from a timewhen the railway and the hotel did not exist; when the occasional whitetraveler went horseback or by bullock-cart, and stopped over night in thesmall dak-bungalow provided at easy distances by the government--ashelter, merely, and nothing more. He had to carry bedding along, or dowithout. The dwellings of the English residents are spacious andcomfortable and commodiously furnished, and surely it must be an oddsight to see half a dozen guests come filing into such a place anddumping blankets and pillows here and there and everywhere. But custommakes incongruous things congruous.
One buys the bedding, with waterproof hold-all for it at almost any shop--there is no difficulty about it.
January 30. What a spectacle the railway station was, at train-time! Itwas a very large station, yet when we arrived it seemed as if the wholeworld was present--half of it inside, the other half outside, and bothhalves, bearing mountainous head-loads of bedding and other freight,trying simultaneously to pass each other, in opposing floods, in onenarrow door. These opposing floods were patient, gentle, long-sufferingnatives, with whites scattered among them at rare intervals; and wherevera white man's native servant appeared, that native seemed to have putaside his natural gentleness for the time and invested himself with thewhite man's privilege of making a way for himself by promptly shoving allintervening black things out of it. In these exhibitions of authoritySatan was scandalous. He was probably a Thug in one of his formerincarnations.
Inside the great station, tides upon tides of rainbow-costumed nativesswept along, this way and that, in massed and bewildering confusion,eager, anxious, belated, distressed; and washed up to the long trains andflowed into them with their packs and bundles, and disappeared, followedat once by the next wash, the next wave. And here and there, in themidst of this hurly-burly, and seemingly undisturbed by it, sat greatgroups of natives on the bare stone floor,--young, slender brown women,old, gray wrinkled women, little soft brown babies, old men, young men,boys; all poor people, but all the females among them, both big andlittle, bejeweled with cheap and showy nose-rings, toe-rings, leglets,and armlets, these things constituting all their wealth, no doubt. Thesesilent crowds sat there with their humble bundles and baskets and smallhousehold gear about them, and patiently waited--for what? A train thatwas to start at some time or other during the day or night! They hadn'ttimed themselves well, but that was no matter--the thing had been soordered from on high, therefore why worry? There was plenty of time,hours and hours of it, and the thing that was to happen would happen--there was no hurrying it.
The natives traveled third class, and at marvelously cheap rates. Theywere packed and crammed into cars that held each about fifty; and it wassaid that often a Brahmin of the highest caste was thus brought intopersonal touch, and consequent defilement, with persons of the lowestcastes--no doubt a very shocking thing if a body could understand it andproperly appreciate it. Yes, a Brahmin who didn't own a rupee andcouldn't borrow one, might have to touch elbows with a rich hereditarylord of inferior caste, inheritor of an ancient title a couple of yardslong, and he would just have to stand it; for if either of the two wasallowed to go in the cars where the sacred white people were, it probablywouldn't be the august poor Brahmin. There was an immense string ofthose third-class cars, for the natives travel by hordes; and a wearyhard night of it the occupants would have, no doubt.
When we reached our car, Satan and Barney had already arrived there withtheir train of porters carrying bedding and parasols and cigar boxes, andwere at work. We named him Barney for short; we couldn't use his realname, there wasn't time.
It was a car that promised comfort; indeed, luxury. Yet the cost of it--well, economy could no further go; even in France; not even in Italy. Itwas built of the plainest and cheapest partially-smoothed boards, with acoating of dull paint on them, and there was nowhere a thought ofdecoration. The floor was bare, but would not long remain so when thedust should begin to fly. Across one end of the compartment ran anetting for the accommodation of hand-baggage; at the other end was adoor which would shut, upon compulsion, but wouldn't stay shut; it openedinto a narrow little closet which had a wash-bowl in one end of it, and aplace to put a towel, in case you had one with you--and you would be sureto have towels, because you buy them with the bedding, knowing that therailway doesn't furnish them. On each side of the car, and running foreand aft, was a broad leather-covered sofa to sit on in the day and sleepon at night. Over each sofa hung, by straps, a wide, flat,leather-covered shelf--to sleep on. In the daytime you can hitch it upagainst the wall, out of the way--and then you have a big unencumberedand most comfortable room to spread out in. No car in any country isquite its equal for comfort (and privacy) I think. For usually there arebut two persons in it; and even when there are four there is but littlesense of impaired privacy. Our own cars at home can surpass the railwayworld in all details but that one: they have no cosiness; there are toomany people together.
At the foot of each sofa was a side-door, for entrance and exit.Along the whole length of the sofa on each side of the car ran a row oflarge single-plate windows, of a blue tint-blue to soften the bitterglare of the sun and protect one's eyes from torture. These could be letdown out of the way when one wanted the breeze. In the roof were two oillamps which gave a light strong enough to read by; each had a green-clothattachment by which it could be covered when the light should be nolonger needed.
While we talked outside with friends, Barney and Satan placed thehand-baggage, books, fruits, and soda-bottles in the racks, and thehold-alls and heavy baggage in the closet, hung the overcoats andsun-helmets and towels on the hooks, hoisted the two bed-shelves up outof the way, then shouldered their bedding and retired to the third class.
Now then, you see what a handsome, spacious, light, airy, homelike placeit was, wherein to walk up and down, or sit and write, or stretch out andread and smoke. A central door in the forward end of the compartmentopened into a similar compartment. It was occupied by my wife anddaughter. About nine in the evening, while we halted a while at astation, Barney and Satan came and undid the clumsy big hold-alls, andspread the bedding on the sofas in both compartments--mattresses, sheets,gay coverlets, pillows, all complete; there are no chambermaids in India--apparently it was an office that was never heard of. Then theyclosed the communicating door, nimbly tidied up our place, put thenight-clothing on the beds and the slippers under them, then returnedto their own quarters.
January 31. It was novel and pleasant, and I stayed awake as long as Icould, to enjoy it, and to read about those strange people the Thugs. Inmy sleep they remained with me, and tried to strangle me. The leader ofthe gang was that giant Hindoo who was such a picture in the strong lightwhen we were leaving those Hindoo betrothal festivities at two o'clock inthe morning--Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale, Vakeel to theGaikwar of Baroda. It was he that brought me the invitation from hismaster to go to Baroda and lecture to that prince--and now he wasmisbehaving in my dreams. But all things can happen in dreams. It isindeed as the Sweet Singer of Michigan says--irrelevantly, of course, forthe one and unfailing great quality which distinguishes her poetry fromShakespeare's and makes it precious to us is its stern and simpleirrelevancy:
 My heart was gay and happy, This was ever in my mind, There is better times a coming, And I hope some day to find Myself capable of composing, It was my heart's delight To compose on a sentimental subject If it came in my mind just right.
--["The Sentimental Song Book," p. 49; theme, "The Author's Early Life,"19th stanza.]
Barroda. Arrived at 7 this morning. The dawn was just beginning toshow. It was forlorn to have to turn out in a strange place at such atime, and the blinking lights in the station made it seem night still.But the gentlemen who had come to receive us were there with theirservants, and they make quick work; there was no lost time. We were soonoutside and moving swiftly through the soft gray light, and presentlywere comfortably housed--with more servants to help than we were used to,and with rather embarassingly important officials to direct them. But itwas custom; they spoke Ballarat English, their bearing was charming andhospitable, and so all went well.
Breakfast was a satisfaction. Across the lawns was visible in thedistance through the open window an Indian well, with two oxen trampingleisurely up and down long inclines, drawing water; and out of thestillness came the suffering screech of the machinery--not quite musical,and yet soothingly melancholy and dreamy and reposeful--a wail of lostspirits, one might imagine. And commemorative and reminiscent, perhaps;for of course the Thugs used to throw people down that well when theywere done with them.
After breakfast the day began, a sufficiently busy one. We were drivenby winding roads through a vast park, with noble forests of great trees,and with tangles and jungles of lovely growths of a humbler sort; and atone place three large gray apes came out and pranced across the road--agood deal of a surprise and an unpleasant one, for such creatures belongin the menagerie, and they look artificial and out of place in awilderness.
We came to the city, by and by, and drove all through it. IntenselyIndian, it was, and crumbly, and mouldering, and immemorially old, to allappearance. And the houses--oh, indescribably quaint and curious theywere, with their fronts an elaborate lace-work of intricate and beautifulwood-carving, and now and then further adorned with rude pictures ofelephants and princes and gods done in shouting colors; and all theground floors along these cramped and narrow lanes occupied as shops--shops unbelievably small and impossibly packed with merchantable rubbish,and with nine-tenths-naked natives squatting at their work of hammering,pounding, brazing, soldering, sewing, designing, cooking, measuring outgrain, grinding it, repairing idols--and then the swarm of ragged andnoisy humanity under the horses' feet and everywhere, and the pervadingreek and fume and smell! It was all wonderful and delightful.
Imagine a file of elephants marching through such a crevice of a streetand scraping the paint off both sides of it with their hides. How bigthey must look, and how little they must make the houses look; and whenthe elephants are in their glittering court costume, what a contrast theymust make with the humble and sordid surroundings. And when a madelephant goes raging through, belting right and left with his trunk, howdo these swarms of people get out of the way? I suppose it is a thingwhich happens now and then in the mad season (for elephants have a madseason).
I wonder how old the town is. There are patches of building--massivestructures, monuments, apparently--that are so battered and worn, andseemingly so tired and so burdened with the weight of age, and so dulledand stupefied with trying to remember things they forgot before historybegan, that they give one the feeling that they must have been a part oforiginal Creation. This is indeed one of the oldest of the princedoms ofIndia, and has always been celebrated for its barbaric pomps andsplendors, and for the wealth of its princes.
