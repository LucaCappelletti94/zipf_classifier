From New Poems (1916).
I, the man with the red scarf,  Will give thee what I have, this last week's earnings. Take them, and buy thee a silver ring  And wed me, to ease my yearnings.  For the rest, when thou art wedded  I'll wet my brow for thee With sweat, I'll enter a house for thy sake,  Thou shalt shut doors on me.
