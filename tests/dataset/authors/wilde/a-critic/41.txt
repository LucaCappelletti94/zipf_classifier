Perhaps he will write poetry some day. If he does we would earnestly
appeal to him to give up calling a cock 'proud chanticleer.' Few
synonyms are so depressing.
A young writer can gain more from the study of a literary poet than from
the study of a lyrist.
I have seen many audiences more interesting than the actors, and have
often heard better dialogue in the foyer than I have on the stage.
The Dramatic College might take up the education of spectators as well as
that of players, and teach people that there is a proper moment for the
throwing of flowers as well as a proper method.
Life remains eternally unchanged; it is art which, by presenting it to us
under various forms, enables us to realize its many-sided mysteries, and
to catch the quality of its most fiery-coloured moments. The
originality, I mean, which we ask from the artist, is originality of
treatment, not of subject. It is only the unimaginative who ever
invents. The true artist is known by the use he makes of what he
annexes, and he annexes everything.
If I ventured on a bit of advice, which I feel most reluctant to do, it
would be to the effect that while one should always study the method of a
great artist, one should never imitate his manner. The manner of an
artist is essentially individual, the method of an artist is absolutely
universal. The first is personality, which no one should copy; the
second is perfection, which all should aim at.
A critic who posed as an authority on field sports assured me that no one
ever went out hunting when roses were in full bloom. Personally, that is
exactly the season I would select for the chase, but then I know more
about flowers than I do about foxes, and like them much better.
The nineteenth century may be a prosaic age, but we fear that, if we are
to judge by the general run of novels, it is not an age of prose.
Perhaps in this century we are too altruistic to be really artistic.
I am led to hope that the University will some day have a theatre of its
own, and that proficiency in scene-painting will be regarded as a
necessary qualification for the Slade Professorship. On the stage,
literature returns to life and archaeology becomes art. A fine theatre
is a temple where all the muses may meet, a second Parnassus.
It would be sad indeed if the many volumes of poems that are every year
published in London found no readers but the authors themselves and the
authors' relations; and the real philanthropist should recognize it as
part of his duties to buy every new book of verse that appears.
A fifteen-line sonnet is as bad a monstrosity as a sonnet in dialogue.
Antiquarian books, as a rule, are extremely dull reading. They give us
facts without form, science without style, and learning without life.
The Roman patron, in fact, kept the Roman poet alive, and we fancy that
many of our modern bards rather regret the old system. Better, surely,
the humiliation of the sportula than the indignity of a bill for
printing! Better to accept a country-house as a gift than to be in debt
to one's landlady! On the whole, the patron was an excellent
institution, if not for poetry at least for the poets; . . . every poet
longs for a Maecenas.
The two things the Greeks valued most in actors were grace of gesture and
music of voice. Indeed, to gain these virtues their actors used to
subject themselves to a regular course of gymnastics and a particular
regime of diet, health being to the Greeks not merely a quality of art,
but a condition of its production.
One should not be too severe on English novels: they are the only
relaxation of the intellectually unemployed.
Most modern novels are more remarkable for their crime than for their
culture.
Not that a tramp's mode of life is at all unsuited to the development of
the poetic faculty. Far from it! He, if any one, should possess that
freedom of mood which is so essential to the artist, for he has no taxes
to pay and no relations to worry him. The man who possesses a permanent
address, and whose name is to be found in the Directory, is necessarily
limited and localized. Only the tramp has absolute liberty of living.
Was not Homer himself a vagrant, and did not Thespis go about in a
caravan?
In art as in life the law of heredity holds good. On est toujours fils
de quelqu'un.
He has succeeded in studying a fine poet without stealing from him--a
very difficult thing to do.
Morocco is a sort of paradox among countries, for though it lies westward
of Piccadilly, yet it is purely Oriental in character, and though it is
but three hours' sail from Europe, yet it makes you feel (to use the
forcible expression of an American writer) as if you had been taken up by
the scruff of the neck and set down in the Old Testament.
As children themselves are the perfect flowers of life, so a collection
of the best poems written on children should be the most perfect of all
anthologies.
No English poet has written of children with more love and grace and
delicacy [than Herrick]. His Ode on the Birth of Our Saviour, his poem
To His Saviour, A Child: A Present by a Child, his Graces for
Children, and his many lovely epitaphs on children are all of them
exquisite works of art, simple, sweet and sincere.
As the cross-benches form a refuge for those who have no minds to make
up, so those who cannot make up their minds always take to Homeric
studies. Many of our leaders have sulked in their tents with Achilles
after some violent political crisis and, enraged at the fickleness of
fortune, more than one has given up to poetry what was obviously meant
for party.
There are two ways of misunderstanding a poem. One is to misunderstand
it and the other to praise it for qualities it does not possess.
Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding
us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly
uninteresting event. It is true that such aphorisms as

    Graves are a mother's dimples
          When we complain,

or

    The primrose wears a constant smile,
    And captive takes the heart,

can hardly be said to belong to the very highest order of poetry, still,
they are preferable, on the whole, to the date of Hannah More's birth, or
of the burning down of Exeter Change, or of the opening of the Great
Exhibition; and though it would be dangerous to make calendars the basis
of Culture, we should all be much improved if we began each day with a
fine passage of English poetry.
Even the most uninteresting poet cannot survive bad editing.
Prefixed to the Calendar is an introductory note . . . displaying that
intimate acquaintance with Sappho's lost poems which is the privilege
only of those who are not acquainted with Greek literature.
Mediocre critics are usually safe in their generalities; it is in their
reasons and examples that they come so lamentably to grief.
All premature panegyrics bring their own punishment upon themselves.
No one survives being over-estimated.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was one of the first true men of letters
America produced, and as such deserves a high place in any history of
American civilization. To a land out of breath in its greed for gain he
showed the example of a life devoted entirely to the study of literature;
his lectures, though not by any means brilliant, were still productive of
much good; he had a most charming and gracious personality, and he wrote
some pretty poems. But his poems are not of the kind that call for
intellectual analysis or for elaborate description or, indeed, for any
serious discussion at all.
Though the Psalm of Life be shouted from Maine to California, that
would not make it true poetry.
Longfellow has no imitators, for of echoes themselves there are no echoes
and it is only style that makes a school.
Poe's marvellous lines To Helen, a poem as beautiful as a Greek gem and
as musical as Apollo's lute.
Good novelists are much rarer than good sons, and none of us would part
readily with Micawber and Mrs. Nickleby. Still, the fact remains that a
man who was affectionate and loving to his children, generous and
warm-hearted to his friends, and whose books are the very bacchanalia of
benevolence, pilloried his parents to make the groundlings laugh, and
this fact every biographer of Dickens should face and, if possible,
explain.
No age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor.
What we do not know about Shakespeare is a most fascinating subject, and
one that would fill a volume, but what we do know about him is so meagre
and inadequate that when it is collected together the result is rather
depressing.
They show a want of knowledge that must be the result of years of study.
Rossetti's was a great personality, and personalities such as his do not
easily survive shilling primers.
We are sorry to find an English dramatic critic misquoting Shakespeare,
as we had always been of opinion that this was a privilege reserved
specially for our English actors.
Biographies of this kind rob life of much of its dignity and its wonder,
add to death itself a new terror, and make one wish that all art were
anonymous.
A pillar of fire to the few who knew him, and of cloud to the many who
knew him not, Dante Gabriel Rossetti lived apart from the gossip and
tittle-tattle of a shallow age. He never trafficked with the merchants
for his soul, nor brought his wares into the market-place for the idle to
gape at. Passionate and romantic though he was, yet there was in his
nature something of high austerity. He loved seclusion, and hated
notoriety, and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years
after his death he was to make his appearance in a series of popular
biographies, sandwiched between the author of Pickwick and the Great
Lexicographer.
We sincerely hope that a few more novels like these will be published, as
the public will then find out that a bad book is very dear at a shilling.
The only form of fiction in which real characters do not seem out of
place is history. In novels they are detestable.
Shilling literature is always making demands on our credulity without
ever appealing to our imagination.
Pathology is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature, and in
art, as in politics, there is a great future for monsters.
It is only mediocrities and old maids who consider it a grievance to be
misunderstood.
As truly religious people are resigned to everything, even to mediocre
poetry, there is no reason at all why Madame Guyon's verses should not be
popular with a large section of the community.
A simile committing suicide is always a depressing spectacle.
Such novels as Scamp are possibly more easy to write than they are to
read.
We have no doubt that when Bailey wrote to Lord Houghton that
common-sense and gentleness were Keats's two special characteristics the
worthy Archdeacon meant extremely well, but we prefer the real Keats,
with his passionate wilfulness, his fantastic moods and his fine
inconsistence. Part of Keats's charm as a man is his fascinating
incompleteness.
The Apostolic dictum, that women should not be suffered to teach, is no
longer applicable to a society such as ours, with its solidarity of
interests, its recognition of natural rights, and its universal
education, however suitable it may have been to the Greek cities under
Roman rule. Nothing in the United States struck me more than the fact
that the remarkable intellectual progress of that country is very largely
due to the efforts of American women, who edit many of the most powerful
magazines and newspapers, take part in the discussion of every question
of public interest, and exercise an important influence upon the growth
and tendencies of literature and art. Indeed, the women of America are
the one class in the community that enjoys that leisure which is so
necessary for culture. The men are, as a rule, so absorbed in business,
that the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily
life is left almost entirely to the opposite sex, and an eminent
Bostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole culture
of his country would be in petticoats. By that time, however, it is
probable that the dress of the two sexes will be assimilated, as
similarity of costume always follows similarity of pursuits.
The aim of social comedy, in Menander no less than in Sheridan, is to
mirror the manners, not to reform the morals, of its day, and the censure
of the Puritan, whether real or affected, is always out of place in
literary criticism, and shows a want of recognition of the essential
distinction between art and life. After all, it is only the Philistine
who thinks of blaming Jack Absolute for his deception, Bob Acres for his
cowardice, and Charles Surface for his extravagance, and there is very
little use in airing one's moral sense at the expense of one's artistic
appreciation.
The AEneid bears almost the same relation to the Iliad that the
Idylls of the King do to the old Celtic romances of Arthur. Like them
it is full of felicitous modernisms, of exquisite literary echoes and of
delicate and delightful pictures; as Lord Tennyson loves England so did
Virgil love Rome; the pageants of history and the purple of empire are
equally dear to both poets; but neither of them has the grand simplicity
or the large humanity of the early singers, and, as a hero, AEneas is no
less a failure than Arthur.
There is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to cultivate
impossible virtues.
As far as the serious presentation of life is concerned, what we require
is more imaginative treatment, greater freedom from theatric language and
theatric convention. It may be questioned, also, whether the consistent
reward of virtue and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest
ideal for an art that claims to mirror nature.
True originality is to be found rather in the use made of a model than in
the rejection of all models and masters. Dans l'art comme dans la
nature on est toujours fils de quelqu'un, and we should not quarrel with
the reed if it whispers to us the music of the lyre. A little child once
asked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets how to sing.
In France they have had one great genius, Balzac, who invented the modern
method of looking at life; and one great artist, Flaubert, who is the
impeccable master of style; and to the influence of these two men we may
trace almost all contemporary French fiction. But in England we have had
no schools worth speaking of. The fiery torch lit by the Brontes has not
been passed on to other hands; Dickens has influenced only journalism;
Thackeray's delightful superficial philosophy, superb narrative power,
and clever social satire have found no echoes; nor has Trollope left any
direct successors behind him--a fact which is not much to be regretted,
however, as, admirable though Trollope undoubtedly is for rainy
afternoons and tedious railway journeys, from the point of view of
literature he is merely the perpetual curate of Pudlington Parva.
George Meredith's style is chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of
lightning. As a writer he has mastered everything, except language; as a
novelist he can do everything, except tell a story; as an artist he is
everything, except articulate. Too strange to be popular, too individual
to have imitators, the author of Richard Feverel stands absolutely
alone. It is easy to disarm criticism, but he has disarmed the disciple.
He gives us his philosophy through the medium of wit, and is never so
pathetic as when he is humorous. To turn truth into a paradox is not
difficult, but George Meredith makes all his paradoxes truths, and no
Theseus can thread his labyrinth, no OEdipus solve his secret.
The most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern French poets once
remarked that a man can live for three days without bread, but that no
one can live for three days without poetry. This, however, can hardly be
said to be a popular view, or one that commends itself to that curiously
uncommon quality which is called common-sense. I fancy that most people,
if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet, certainly like their
culture to repose on a basis of good cookery.
A cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and no
little poet worth understanding, but that otherwise poetry is an
admirable thing. This, however, seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the
subject. Little poets are an extremely interesting study. The best of
them have often some new beauty to show us, and though the worst of them
may bore yet they rarely brutalize.
It is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play they
should always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of a
bad translator. We fear that Mr. Bohn has much to answer for.
In one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result
is extremely depressing.

    Earth wears her grandest robe, by autumn spun,
    Like some stout matron who of youth has run
    The course, . . .


is the most dreadful simile we have ever come across even in poetry. Mr.
Griffiths should beware of originality. Like beauty, it is a fatal gift.
There is a wide difference between the beautiful Tuscan city and the
sea-city of the Adriatic. Florence is a city full of memories of the
great figures of the past. The traveller cannot pass along her streets
without treading in the very traces of Dante, without stepping on soil
made memorable by footprints never to be effaced. The greatness of the
surroundings, the palaces, churches, and frowning mediaeval castles in
the midst of the city, are all thrown into the background by the
greatness, the individuality, the living power and vigour of the men who
are their originators, and at the same time their inspiring soul. But
when we turn to Venice the effect is very different. We do not think of
the makers of that marvellous city, but rather of what they made. The
idealized image of Venice herself meets us everywhere. The mother is not
overshadowed by the too great glory of any of her sons. In her records
the city is everything--the republic, the worshipped ideal of a community
in which every man for the common glory seems to have been willing to
sink his own. We know that Dante stood within the red walls of the
arsenal, and saw the galleys making and mending, and the pitch flaming up
to heaven; Petrarch came to visit the great Mistress of the Sea, taking
refuge there, 'in this city, true home of the human race,' from trouble,
war and pestilence outside; and Byron, with his facile enthusiasms and
fervent eloquence, made his home for a time in one of the stately,
decaying palaces; but with these exceptions no great poet has ever
associated himself with the life of Venice. She had architects,
sculptors and painters, but no singer of her own.
To realize the popularity of the great poets one should turn to the minor
poets and see whom they follow, what master they select, whose music they
echo.
Ordinary theology has long since converted its gold into lead, and words
and phrases that once touched the heart of the world have become
wearisome and meaningless through repetition. If Theology desires to
move us, she must re-write her formulas.
It takes a great artist to be thoroughly modern. Nature is always a
little behind the age.
Mr. Nash, who styles himself 'a humble soldier in the army of Faith,'
expresses a hope that his book may 'invigorate devotional feeling,
especially among the young, to whom verse is perhaps more attractive than
to their elders,' but we should be sorry to think that people of any age
could admire such a paraphrase as the following:

    Foxes have holes in which to slink for rest,
    The birds of air find shelter in the nest;
    But He, the Son of Man and Lord of all,
    Has no abiding place His own to call.


It is a curious fact that the worst work is always done with the best
intentions, and that people are never so trivial as when they take
themselves very seriously.
Mr. Foster is an American poet who has read Hawthorne, which is wise of
him, and imitated Longfellow, which is not quite so commendable.
Andiatorocte is the title of a volume of poems by the Rev. Clarence
Walworth, of Albany, N.Y. It is a word borrowed from the Indians, and
should, we think, be returned to them as soon as possible. The most
curious poem of the book is called Scenes at the Holy Home:

       Jesus and Joseph at work!  Hurra!
    Sight never to see again,
       A prentice Deity plies the saw,
    While the Master ploughs with the plane.


Poems of this kind were popular in the Middle Ages when the cathedrals of
every Christian country served as its theatres. They are anachronisms
now, and it is odd that they should come to us from the United States.
In matters of this kind we should have some protection.
As for the triolets, and the rondels, and the careful study of metrical
subtleties, these things are merely the signs of a desire for perfection
in small things and of the recognition of poetry as an art. They have
had certainly one good result--they have made our minor poets readable,
and have not left us entirely at the mercy of geniuses.
Poetry has many modes of music; she does not blow through one pipe alone.
Directness of utterance is good, but so is the subtle recasting of
thought into a new and delightful form. Simplicity is good, but
complexity, mystery, strangeness, symbolism, obscurity even, these have
their value. Indeed, properly speaking, there is no such thing as Style;
there are merely styles, that is all.
Writers of poetical prose are rarely good poets.
Poetry may be said to need far more self-restraint than prose. Its
conditions are more exquisite. It produces its effects by more subtle
means. It must not be allowed to degenerate into mere rhetoric or mere
eloquence. It is, in one sense, the most self-conscious of all the arts,
as it is never a means to an end but always an end in itself.
It may be difficult for a poet to find English synonyms for Asiatic
expressions, but even if it were impossible it is none the less a poet's
duty to find them. As it is, Sir Edwin Arnold has translated Sa'di and
some one must translate Sir Edwin Arnold.
Lounging in the open air is not a bad school for poets, but it largely
depends on the lounger.
People are so fond of giving away what they do not want themselves, that
charity is largely on the increase. But with this kind of charity I have
not much sympathy. If one gives away a book, it should be a charming
book--so charming, that one regrets having given it.
Mr. Whistler, for some reason or other, always adopted the phraseology of
the minor prophets. Possibly it was in order to emphasize his well-known
claims to verbal inspiration, or perhaps he thought with Voltaire that
Habakkuk etait capable de tout, and wished to shelter himself under the
shield of a definitely irresponsible writer none of whose prophecies,
according to the French philosopher, has ever been fulfilled. The idea
was clever enough at the beginning, but ultimately the manner became
monotonous. The spirit of the Hebrews is excellent but their mode of
writing is not to be imitated, and no amount of American jokes will give
it that modernity which is essential to a good literary style. Admirable
as are Mr. Whistler's fireworks on canvas, his fireworks in prose are
abrupt, violent and exaggerated.
'The decisive events of the world,' as has been well said, 'take place in
the intellect,' and as for Board-schools, academic ceremonies, hospital
wards and the like, they may be well left to the artists of the
illustrated papers, who do them admirably and quite as well as they need
be done. Indeed, the pictures of contemporary events, Royal marriages,
naval reviews and things of this kind that appear in the Academy every
year, are always extremely bad; while the very same subjects treated in
black and white in the Graphic or the London News are excellent.
Besides, if we want to understand the history of a nation through the
medium of art, it is to the imaginative and ideal arts that we have to go
and not to the arts that are definitely imitative. The visible aspect of
life no longer contains for us the secret of life's spirit.
The difficulty under which the novelists of our day labour seems to me to
be this: if they do not go into society, their books are unreadable; and
if they do go into society, they have no time left for writing.
I must confess that most modern mysticism seems to me to be simply a
method of imparting useless knowledge in a form that no one can
understand. Allegory, parable, and vision have their high artistic uses,
but their philosophical and scientific uses are very small.
The object of most modern fiction is not to give pleasure to the artistic
instinct, but rather to portray life vividly for us, to draw attention to
social anomalies, and social forms of injustice. Many of our novelists
are really pamphleteers, reformers masquerading as story-tellers, earnest
sociologists seeking to mend as well as to mirror life.
The book is certainly characteristic of an age so practical and so
literary as ours, an age in which all social reforms have been preceded
and have been largely influenced by fiction.
Mr. Stopford Brooke said some time ago that Socialism and the socialistic
spirit would give our poets nobler and loftier themes for song, would
widen their sympathies and enlarge the horizon of their vision, and would
touch, with the fire and fervour of a new faith, lips that had else been
silent, hearts that but for this fresh gospel had been cold. What Art
gains from contemporary events is always a fascinating problem and a
problem that is not easy to solve. It is, however, certain that
Socialism starts well equipped. She has her poets and her painters, her
art lecturers and her cunning designers, her powerful orators and her
clever writers. If she fails it will not be for lack of expression. If
she succeeds her triumph will not be a triumph of mere brute force.
Socialism is not going to allow herself to be trammelled by any hard and
fast creed or to be stereotyped into an iron formula. She welcomes many
and multiform natures. She rejects none and has room for all. She has
the attraction of a wonderful personality and touches the heart of one
and the brain of another, and draws this man by his hatred and injustice,
and his neighbour by his faith in the future, and a third, it may be, by
his love of art or by his wild worship of a lost and buried past. And
all of this is well. For, to make men Socialists is nothing, but to make
Socialism human is a great thing.
The Reformation gained much from the use of popular hymn-tunes, and the
Socialists seem determined to gain by similar means a similar hold upon
the people. However, they must not be too sanguine about the result.
The walls of Thebes rose up to the sound of music, and Thebes was a very
dull city indeed.
We really must protest against Mr. Matthews' efforts to confuse the
poetry of Piccadilly with the poetry of Parnassus. To tell us, for
instance, that Mr. Austin Dobson's verse 'has not the condensed clearness
nor the incisive vigor of Mr. Locker's' is really too bad even for
Transatlantic criticism. Nobody who lays claim to the slightest
knowledge of literature and the forms of literature should ever bring the
two names into conjunction.
Mr. Dobson has produced work that is absolutely classical in its
exquisite beauty of form. Nothing more artistically perfect in its way
than the Lines to a Greek Girl has been written in our time. This
little poem will be remembered in literature as long as Thyrsis is
remembered, and Thyrsis will never be forgotten. Both have that note
of distinction that is so rare in these days of violence, exaggeration
and rhetoric. Of course, to suggest, as Mr. Matthews does, that Mr.
Dobson's poems belong to 'the literature of power' is ridiculous. Power
is not their aim, nor is it their effect. They have other qualities, and
in their own delicately limited sphere they have no contemporary rivals;
they have none even second to them.
The heroine is a sort of well-worn Becky Sharp, only much more beautiful
than Becky, or at least than Thackeray's portraits of her, which,
however, have always seemed to me rather ill-natured. I feel sure that
Mrs. Rawdon Crawley was extremely pretty, and I have never understood how
it was that Thackeray could caricature with his pencil so fascinating a
creation of his pen.
A critic recently remarked of Adam Lindsay Gordon that through him
Australia had found her first fine utterance in song. This, however, is
an amiable error. There is very little of Australia in Gordon's poetry.
His heart and mind and fancy were always preoccupied with memories and
dreams of England and such culture as England gave him. He owed nothing
to the land of his adoption. Had he stayed at home he would have done
much better work.
That Australia, however, will some day make amends by producing a poet of
her own we cannot doubt, and for him there will be new notes to sound and
new wonders to tell of.
The best that we can say of him is that he wrote imperfectly in Australia
those poems that in England he might have made perfect.
Judges, like the criminal classes, have their lighter moments.
There seems to be some curious connection between piety and poor rhymes.
The South African poets, as a class, are rather behind the age. They
seem to think that 'Aurora' is a very novel and delightful epithet for
the dawn. On the whole they depress us.
The only original thing in the volume is the description of Mr. Robert
Buchanan's 'grandeur of mind.' This is decidedly new.
Dr. Cockle tells us that Mullner's Guilt and The Ancestress of
Grillparzer are the masterpieces of German fate-tragedy. His translation
of the first of these two masterpieces does not make us long for any
further acquaintance with the school. Here is a specimen from the fourth
act of the fate-tragedy.

 SCENE VIII.

 ELVIRA. 
 HUGO.

 ELVIRA (after long silence, leaving the harp, steps to Hugo,
and seeks his gaze).
 HUGO (softly). Though I made sacrifice of thy sweet life, the
Father has forgiven. Can the wife--forgive?
 ELVIRA (on his breast). She can!
 HUGO (with all the warmth of love). Dear wife!
 ELVIRA (after a pause, in deep sorrow). Must it be so, beloved
one?
 HUGO (sorry to have betrayed himself). What?



The Renaissance had for its object the development of great
personalities. The perfect freedom of the temperament in matters of art,
the perfect freedom of the intellect in intellectual matters, the full
development of the individual, were the things it aimed at. As we study
its history we find it full of great anarchies. It solved no political
or social problems; it did not seek to solve them. The ideal of the
'Grand Siecle,' and of Richelieu, in whom the forces of that great age
were incarnate, was different. The ideas of citizenship, of the building
up of a great nation, of the centralization of forces, of collective
action, of ethnic unity of purpose, came before the world.
The creation of a formal tradition upon classical lines is never without
its danger, and it is sad to find the provincial towns of France, once so
varied and individual in artistic expression, writing to Paris for
designs and advice. And yet, through Colbert's great centralizing scheme
of State supervision and State aid, France was the one country in Europe,
and has remained the one country in Europe, where the arts are not
divorced from industry.
Hawthorne re-created for us the America of the past with the incomparable
grace of a very perfect artist, but Mr. Bret Harte's emphasized modernity
has, in its own sphere, won equal, or almost equal, triumphs.
It is pleasant to come across a heroine [Bret Harte's Cressy] who is
not identified with any great cause, and represents no important
principle, but is simply a wonderful nymph from American backwoods, who
has in her something of Artemis, and not a little of Aphrodite.
It is always a pleasure to come across an American poet who is not
national, and who tries to give expression to the literature that he
loves rather than to the land in which he lives. The Muses care so
little for geography!
Blue-books are generally dull reading, but Blue-books on Ireland have
always been interesting. They form the record of one of the great
tragedies of modern Europe. In them England has written down her
indictment against herself and has given to the world the history of her
shame. If in the last century she tried to govern Ireland with an
insolence that was intensified by race hatred and religious prejudice,
she has sought to rule her in this century with a stupidity that is
aggravated by good intentions.
Like most penmen he [Froude] overrates the power of the sword. Where
England has had to struggle she has been wise. Where physical strength
has been on her side, as in Ireland, she has been made unwieldy by that
strength. Her own strong hands have blinded her. She has had force but
no direction.
There are some who will welcome with delight the idea of solving the
Irish question by doing away with the Irish people. There are others who
will remember that Ireland has extended her boundaries, and that we have
now to reckon with her not merely in the Old World but in the New.
Plastic simplicity of outline may render for us the visible aspect of
life; it is different when we come to deal with those secrets which
self-consciousness alone contains, and which self-consciousness itself
can but half reveal. Action takes place in the sunlight, but the soul
works in the dark. There is something curiously interesting in the
marked tendency of modern poetry to become obscure. Many critics,
writing with their eyes fixed on the masterpieces of past literature,
have ascribed this tendency to wilfulness and to affectation. Its origin
is rather to be found in the complexity of the new problems, and in the
fact that self-consciousness is not yet adequate to explain the contents
of the Ego. In Mr. Browning's poems, as in life itself, which has
suggested, or rather necessitated, the new method, thought seems to
proceed not on logical lines, but on lines of passion. The unity of the
individual is being expressed through its inconsistencies and its
contradictions. In a strange twilight man is seeking for himself, and
when he has found his own image, he cannot understand it. Objective
forms of art, such as sculpture and the drama, sufficed one for the
perfect presentation of life; they can no longer so suffice.
As he is not a genius he, naturally, behaves admirably on every occasion.
Certainly dialect is dramatic. It is a vivid method of re-creating a
past that never existed. It is something between 'A Return to Nature'
and 'A Return to the Glossary.' It is so artificial that it is really
naive. From the point of view of mere music, much may be said for it.
Wonderful diminutives lend new notes of tenderness to the song. There
are possibilities of fresh rhymes, and in search for a fresh rhyme poets
may be excused if they wander from the broad highroad of classical
utterance into devious byways and less-trodden paths. Sometimes one is
tempted to look on dialect as expressing simply the pathos of
provincialisms, but there is more in it than mere mispronunciation. With
that revival of an antique form, often comes the revival of an antique
spirit. Through limitations that are sometimes uncouth, and always
narrow, comes Tragedy herself; and though she may stammer in her
utterance, and deck herself in cast-off weeds and trammelling raiment,
still we must hold ourselves in readiness to accept her, so rare are her
visits to us now, so rare her presence in an age that demands a happy
ending from every play, and that sees in the theatre merely a source of
amusement.
There is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel backwards.
The last page is, as a rule, the most interesting, and when one begins
with the catastrophe or the denoument one feels on pleasant terms of
equality with the author. It is like going behind the scenes of a
theatre. One is no longer taken in, and the hairbreadth escapes of the
hero and the wild agonies of the heroine leave one absolutely unmoved.
He has every form of sincerity except the sincerity of the artist, a
defect that he shares with most of our popular writers.
On the whole Primavera is a pleasant little book, and we are glad to
welcome it. It is charmingly 'got up,' and undergraduates might read it
with advantage during lecture hours.
