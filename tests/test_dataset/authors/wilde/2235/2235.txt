Albeit nurtured in democracy,And liking best that state republicanWhere every man is Kinglike and no manIs crowned above his fellows, yet I see,Spite of this modern fret for Liberty,Better the rule of One, whom all obey,Than to let clamorous demagogues betrayOur freedom with the kiss of anarchy.Wherefore I love them not whose hands profanePlant the red flag upon the piled-up streetFor no right cause, beneath whose ignorant reignArts, Culture, Reverence, Honour, all things fade,Save Treason and the dagger of her trade,Or Murder with his silent bloody feet.
