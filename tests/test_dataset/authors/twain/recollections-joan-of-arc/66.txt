Supreme in Direst Peril
ANOTHER ten days' wait. The great theologians of that treasury of allvaluable knowledge and all wisdom, the University of Paris, were stillweighing and considering and discussing the Twelve Lies.
I had had but little to do these ten days, so I spent them mainly inwalks about the town with Noel. But there was no pleasure in them, ourspirits being so burdened with cares, and the outlook for Joan growingsteadily darker and darker all the time. And then we naturally contrastedour circumstances with hers: this freedom and sunshine, with her darknessand chains; our comradeship, with her lonely estate; our alleviations ofone sort and another, with her destitution in all. She was used toliberty, but now she had none; she was an out-of-door creature by natureand habit, but now she was shut up day and night in a steel cage like ananimal; she was used to the light, but now she was always in a gloomwhere all objects about her were dim and spectral; she was used to thethousand various sounds which are the cheer and music of a busy life, butnow she heard only the monotonous footfall of the sentry pacing hiswatch; she had been fond of talking with her mates, but now there was noone to talk to; she had had an easy laugh, but it was gone dumb now; shehad been born for comradeship, and blithe and busy work, and all mannerof joyous activities, but here were only dreariness, and leaden hours,and weary inaction, and brooding stillness, and thoughts that travel byday and night and night and day round and round in the same circle, andwear the brain and break the heart with weariness. It was death in life;yes, death in life, that is what it must have been. And there was anotherhard thing about it all. A young girl in trouble needs the soothingsolace and support and sympathy of persons of her own sex, and thedelicate offices and gentle ministries which only these can furnish; yetin all these months of gloomy captivity in her dungeon Joan never saw theface of a girl or a woman. Think how her heart would have leaped to seesuch a face.
Consider. If you would realize how great Joan of Arc was, remember thatit was out of such a place and such circumstances that she came weekafter week and month after month and confronted the master intellects ofFrance single-handed, and baffled their cunningest schemes, defeatedtheir ablest plans, detected and avoided their secretest traps andpitfalls, broke their lines, repelled their assaults, and camped on thefield after every engagement; steadfast always, true to her faith and herideals; defying torture, defying the stake, and answering threats ofeternal death and the pains of hell with a simple "Let come what may,here I take my stand and will abide."
Yes, if you would realize how great was the soul, how profound thewisdom, and how luminous the intellect of Joan of Arc, you must study herthere, where she fought out that long fight all alone--and not merelyagainst the subtlest brains and deepest learning of France, but againstthe ignoble deceits, the meanest treacheries, and the hardest hearts tobe found in any land, pagan or Christian.
She was great in battle--we all know that; great in foresight; great inloyalty and patriotism; great in persuading discontented chiefs andreconciling conflicting interests and passions; great in the ability todiscover merit and genius wherever it lay hidden; great in picturesqueand eloquent speech; supremely great in the gift of firing the hearts ofhopeless men and noble enthusiasms, the gift of turning hares intoheroes, slaves and skulkers into battalions that march to death withsongs on their lips. But all these are exalting activities; they keephand and heart and brain keyed up to their work; there is the joy ofachievement, the inspiration of stir and movement, the applause whichhails success; the soul is overflowing with life and energy, thefaculties are at white heat; weariness, despondency, inertia--these donot exist.
Yes, Joan of Arc was great always, great everywhere, but she was greatestin the Rouen trials.
There she rose above the limitations and infirmities of our human nature,and accomplished under blighting and unnerving and hopeless conditionsall that her splendid equipment of moral and intellectual forces couldhave accomplished if they had been supplemented by the mighty helps ofhope and cheer and light, the presence of friendly faces, and a fair andequal fight, with the great world looking on and wondering.
