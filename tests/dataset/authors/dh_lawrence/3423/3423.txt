  A yellow leaf from the darkness	Hops like a frog before me.	Why should I start and stand still?	 I was watching the woman that bore me	Stretched in the brindled darkness Of the sick-room, rigid with will	To die: and the quick leaf tore me	Back to this rainy swill	Of leaves and lamps and traffic mingled before me.
