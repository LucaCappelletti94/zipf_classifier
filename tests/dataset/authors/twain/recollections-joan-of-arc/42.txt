The Jests of the Burgundians
THE CAMPAIGN of the Loire had as good as opened the road to Rheims. Therewas no sufficient reason now why the Coronation should not take place.The Coronation would complete the mission which Joan had received fromheaven, and then she would be forever done with war, and would fly hometo her mother and her sheep, and never stir from the hearthstone andhappiness any more. That was her dream; and she could not rest, she wasso impatient to see it fulfilled. She became so possessed with thismatter that I began to lose faith in her two prophecies of her earlydeath--and, of course, when I found that faith wavering I encouraged itto waver all the more.
The King was afraid to start to Rheims, because the road was mile-postedwith English fortresses, so to speak. Joan held them in light esteem andnot things to be afraid of in the existing modified condition of Englishconfidence.
And she was right. As it turned out, the march to Rheims was nothing buta holiday excursion: Joan did not even take any artillery along, she wasso sure it would not be necessary. We marched from Gien twelve thousandstrong. This was the 29th of June. The Maid rode by the side of the King;on his other side was the Duke d'Alencon. After the duke followed threeother princes of the blood. After these followed the Bastard of Orleans,the Marshal de Boussac, and the Admiral of France. After these came LaHire, Saintrailles, Tremouille, and a long procession of knights andnobles.
We rested three days before Auxerre. The city provisioned the army, and adeputation waited upon the King, but we did not enter the place.
Saint-Florentin opened its gates to the King.
On the 4th of July we reached Saint-Fal, and yonder lay Troyes beforeus--a town which had a burning interest for us boys; for we rememberedhow seven years before, in the pastures of Domremy, the Sunflower camewith his black flag and brought us the shameful news of the Treaty ofTroyes--that treaty which gave France to England, and a daughter of ourroyal line in marriage to the Butcher of Agincourt. That poor town wasnot to blame, of course; yet we flushed hot with that old memory, andhoped there would be a misunderstanding here, for we dearly wanted tostorm the place and burn it. It was powerfully garrisoned by English andBurgundian soldiery, and was expecting reinforcements from Paris. Beforenight we camped before its gates and made rough work with a sortie whichmarched out against us.
Joan summoned Troyes to surrender. Its commandant, seeing that she had noartillery, scoffed at the idea, and sent her a grossly insulting reply.Five days we consulted and negotiated. No result. The King was about toturn back now and give up. He was afraid to go on, leaving this strongplace in his rear. Then La Hire put in a word, with a slap in it for someof his Majesty's advisers:
"The Maid of Orleans undertook this expedition of her own motion; and itis my mind that it is her judgment that should be followed here, and notthat of any other, let him be of whatsoever breed and standing he may."
There was wisdom and righteousness in that. So the King sent for theMaid, and asked her how she thought the prospect looked. She said,without any tone of doubt or question in her voice:
"In three days' time the place is ours."
The smug Chancellor put in a word now:
"If we were sure of it we would wait her six days."
"Six days, forsooth! Name of God, man, we will enter the gatesto-morrow!"
Then she mounted, and rode her lines, crying out:
"Make preparation--to your work, friends, to your work! We assault atdawn!"
She worked hard that night, slaving away with her own hands like a commonsoldier. She ordered fascines and fagots to be prepared and thrown intothe fosse, thereby to bridge it; and in this rough labor she took a man'sshare.
At dawn she took her place at the head of the storming force and thebugles blew the assault. At that moment a flag of truce was flung to thebreeze from the walls, and Troyes surrendered without firing a shot.
The next day the King with Joan at his side and the Paladin bearing herbanner entered the town in state at the head of the army. And a goodlyarmy it was now, for it had been growing ever bigger and bigger from thefirst.
And now a curious thing happened. By the terms of the treaty made withthe town the garrison of English and Burgundian soldiery were to beallowed to carry away their "goods" with them. This was well, forotherwise how would they buy the wherewithal to live? Very well; thesepeople were all to go out by the one gate, and at the time set for themto depart we young fellows went to that gate, along with the Dwarf, tosee the march-out. Presently here they came in an interminable file, thefoot-soldiers in the lead. As they approached one could see that eachbore a burden of a bulk and weight to sorely tax his strength; and wesaid among ourselves, truly these folk are well off for poor commonsoldiers. When they were come nearer, what do you think? Every rascal ofthem had a French prisoner on his back! They were carrying away their"goods," you see--their property--strictly according to the permissiongranted by the treaty.
Now think how clever that was, how ingenious. What could a body say? whatcould a body do? For certainly these people were within their right.These prisoners were property; nobody could deny that. My dears, if thosehad been English captives, conceive of the richness of that booty! ForEnglish prisoners had been scarce and precious for a hundred years;whereas it was a different matter with French prisoners. They had beenover-abundant for a century. The possessor of a French prisoner did nothold him long for ransom, as a rule, but presently killed him to save thecost of his keep. This shows you how small was the value of such apossession in those times. When we took Troyes a calf was worth thirtyfrancs, a sheep sixteen, a French prisoner eight. It was an enormousprice for those other animals--a price which naturally seems incredibleto you. It was the war, you see. It worked two ways: it made meat dearand prisoners cheap.
Well, here were these poor Frenchmen being carried off. What could we do?Very little of a permanent sort, but we did what we could. We sent amessenger flying to Joan, and we and the French guards halted theprocession for a parley--to gain time, you see. A big Burgundian lost histemper and swore a great oath that none should stop him; he would go, andwould take his prisoner with him. But we blocked him off, and he saw thathe was mistaken about going--he couldn't do it. He exploded into themaddest cursings and revilings, then, and, unlashing his prisoner fromhis back, stood him up, all bound and helpless; then drew his knife, andsaid to us with a light of sarcasting triumph in his eye:
"I may not carry him away, you say--yet he is mine, none will dispute it.Since I may not convey him hence, this property of mine, there is anotherway. Yes, I can kill him; not even the dullest among you will questionthat right. Ah, you had not thought of that--vermin!"
That poor starved fellow begged us with his piteous eyes to save him;then spoke, and said he had a wife and little children at home. Think howit wrung our heartstrings. But what could we do? The Burgundian waswithin his right. We could only beg and plead for the prisoner. Which wedid. And the Burgundian enjoyed it. He stayed his hand to hear more ofit, and laugh at it. That stung. Then the Dwarf said:
"Prithee, young sirs, let me beguile him; for when a matter requiringpermission is to the fore, I have indeed a gift in that sort, as any willtell you that know me well. You smile; and that is punishment for myvanity; and fairly earned, I grant you. Still, if I may toy a little,just a little--" saying which he stepped to the Burgundian and began afair soft speech, all of goodly and gentle tenor; and in the midst hementioned the Maid; and was going on to say how she out of her good heartwould prize and praise this compassionate deed which he was about to-- Itwas as far as he got. The Burgundian burst into his smooth oration withan insult leveled at Joan of Arc. We sprang forward, but the Dwarf, hisface all livid, brushed us aside and said, in a most grave and earnestway:
"I crave your patience. Am not I her guard of honor? This is my affair."
And saying this he suddenly shot his right hand out and gripped the greatBurgundian by the throat, and so held him upright on his feet. "You haveinsulted the Maid," he said; "and the Maid is France. The tongue thatdoes that earns a long furlough."
One heard the muffled cracking of bones. The Burgundian's eyes began toprotrude from their sockets and stare with a leaden dullness at vacancy.The color deepened in his face and became an opaque purple. His handshung down limp, his body collapsed with a shiver, every muscle relaxedits tension and ceased from its function. The Dwarf took away his handand the column of inert mortality sank mushily to the ground.
We struck the bonds from the prisoner and told him he was free. Hiscrawling humbleness changed to frantic joy in a moment, and his ghastlyfear to a childish rage. He flew at that dead corpse and kicked it, spatin its face, danced upon it, crammed mud into its mouth, laughing,jeering, cursing, and volleying forth indecencies and bestialities like adrunken fiend. It was a thing to be expected; soldiering makes fewsaints. Many of the onlookers laughed, others were indifferent, none wassurprised. But presently in his mad caperings the freed man caperedwithin reach of the waiting file, and another Burgundian promptly slippeda knife through his neck, and down he went with a death-shriek, hisbrilliant artery blood spurting ten feet as straight and bright as a rayof light. There was a great burst of jolly laughter all around fromfriend and foe alike; and thus closed one of the pleasantest incidents ofmy checkered military life.
And now came Joan hurrying, and deeply troubled. She considered the claimof the garrison, then said:
"You have right upon your side. It is plain. It was a careless word toput in the treaty, and covers too much. But ye may not take these poormen away. They are French, and I will not have it. The King shall ransomthem, every one. Wait till I send you word from him; and hurt no hair oftheir heads; for I tell you, I who speak, that that would cost you verydear."
That settled it. The prisoners were safe for one while, anyway. Then sherode back eagerly and required that thing of the King, and would listento no paltering and no excuses. So the King told her to have her way, andshe rode straight back and bought the captives free in his name and letthem go.
