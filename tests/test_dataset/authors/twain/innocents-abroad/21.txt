We voyaged by steamer down the Lago di Lecco, through wild mountainscenery, and by hamlets and villas, and disembarked at the town of Lecco.They said it was two hours, by carriage to the ancient city of Bergamo,and that we would arrive there in good season for the railway train. Wegot an open barouche and a wild, boisterous driver, and set out. It wasdelightful. We had a fast team and a perfectly smooth road. There weretowering cliffs on our left, and the pretty Lago di Lecco on our right,and every now and then it rained on us. Just before starting, the driverpicked up, in the street, a stump of a cigar an inch long, and put it inhis mouth. When he had carried it thus about an hour, I thought it wouldbe only Christian charity to give him a light. I handed him my cigar,which I had just lit, and he put it in his mouth and returned his stumpto his pocket! I never saw a more sociable man. At least I never saw aman who was more sociable on a short acquaintance.
We saw interior Italy, now. The houses were of solid stone, and notoften in good repair. The peasants and their children were idle, as ageneral thing, and the donkeys and chickens made themselves at home indrawing-room and bed-chamber and were not molested. The drivers of eachand every one of the slow-moving market-carts we met were stretched inthe sun upon their merchandise, sound a sleep. Every three or fourhundred yards, it seemed to me, we came upon the shrine of some saint orother--a rude picture of him built into a huge cross or a stone pillar bythe road-side.--Some of the pictures of the Saviour were curiosities intheir way. They represented him stretched upon the cross, hiscountenance distorted with agony. From the wounds of the crown ofthorns; from the pierced side; from the mutilated hands and feet; fromthe scourged body--from every hand-breadth of his person streams of bloodwere flowing! Such a gory, ghastly spectacle would frighten the childrenout of their senses, I should think. There were some unique auxiliariesto the painting which added to its spirited effect. These were genuinewooden and iron implements, and were prominently disposed round about thefigure: a bundle of nails; the hammer to drive them; the sponge; the reedthat supported it; the cup of vinegar; the ladder for the ascent of thecross; the spear that pierced the Saviour's side. The crown of thornswas made of real thorns, and was nailed to the sacred head. In someItalian church-paintings, even by the old masters, the Saviour and theVirgin wear silver or gilded crowns that are fastened to the picturedhead with nails. The effect is as grotesque as it is incongruous.
Here and there, on the fronts of roadside inns, we found huge, coarsefrescoes of suffering martyrs like those in the shrines. It could nothave diminished their sufferings any to be so uncouthly represented.We were in the heart and home of priest craft--of a happy, cheerful,contented ignorance, superstition, degradation, poverty, indolence, andeverlasting unaspiring worthlessness. And we said fervently: it suitsthese people precisely; let them enjoy it, along with the other animals,and Heaven forbid that they be molested. We feel no malice toward thesefumigators.
We passed through the strangest, funniest, undreampt-of old towns, weddedto the customs and steeped in the dreams of the elder ages, and perfectlyunaware that the world turns round! And perfectly indifferent, too, asto whether it turns around or stands still. They have nothing to do buteat and sleep and sleep and eat, and toil a little when they can get afriend to stand by and keep them awake. They are not paid for thinking--they are not paid to fret about the world's concerns. They were notrespectable people--they were not worthy people--they were not learnedand wise and brilliant people--but in their breasts, all their stupidlives long, resteth a peace that passeth understanding! How can men,calling themselves men, consent to be so degraded and happy.
We whisked by many a gray old medieval castle, clad thick with ivy thatswung its green banners down from towers and turrets where once some oldCrusader's flag had floated. The driver pointed to one of these ancientfortresses, and said, (I translate):
"Do you see that great iron hook that projects from the wall just underthe highest window in the ruined tower?"
We said we could not see it at such a distance, but had no doubt it wasthere.
"Well," he said; "there is a legend connected with that iron hook.Nearly seven hundred years ago, that castle was the property of the nobleCount Luigi Gennaro Guido Alphonso di Genova----"
"What was his other name?" said Dan.
"He had no other name. The name I have spoken was all the name he had.He was the son of----"
"Poor but honest parents--that is all right--never mind the particulars--go on with the legend."
 THE LEGEND.
Well, then, all the world, at that time, was in a wild excitement aboutthe Holy Sepulchre. All the great feudal lords in Europe were pledgingtheir lands and pawning their plate to fit out men-at-arms so that theymight join the grand armies of Christendom and win renown in the HolyWars. The Count Luigi raised money, like the rest, and one mildSeptember morning, armed with battle-ax, portcullis and thunderingculverin, he rode through the greaves and bucklers of his donjon-keepwith as gallant a troop of Christian bandits as ever stepped in Italy.He had his sword, Excalibur, with him. His beautiful countess and heryoung daughter waved him a tearful adieu from the battering-rams andbuttresses of the fortress, and he galloped away with a happy heart.
He made a raid on a neighboring baron and completed his outfit with thebooty secured. He then razed the castle to the ground, massacred thefamily and moved on. They were hardy fellows in the grand old days ofchivalry. Alas! Those days will never come again.
Count Luigi grew high in fame in Holy Land. He plunged into the carnageof a hundred battles, but his good Excalibur always brought him outalive, albeit often sorely wounded. His face became browned by exposureto the Syrian sun in long marches; he suffered hunger and thirst; hepined in prisons, he languished in loathsome plague-hospitals. And manyand many a time he thought of his loved ones at home, and wondered if allwas well with them. But his heart said, Peace, is not thy brotherwatching over thy household?

Forty-two years waxed and waned; the good fight was won; Godfrey reignedin Jerusalem--the Christian hosts reared the banner of the cross abovethe Holy Sepulchre!
Twilight was approaching. Fifty harlequins, in flowing robes, approachedthis castle wearily, for they were on foot, and the dust upon theirgarments betokened that they had traveled far. They overtook a peasant,and asked him if it were likely they could get food and a hospitable bedthere, for love of Christian charity, and if perchance, a moral parlorentertainment might meet with generous countenance--"for," said they,"this exhibition hath no feature that could offend the most fastidioustaste."
"Marry," quoth the peasant, "an' it please your worships, ye had betterjourney many a good rood hence with your juggling circus than trust yourbones in yonder castle."
"How now, sirrah!" exclaimed the chief monk, "explain thy ribald speech,or by'r Lady it shall go hard with thee."
"Peace, good mountebank, I did but utter the truth that was in my heart.San Paolo be my witness that did ye but find the stout Count Leonardo inhis cups, sheer from the castle's topmost battlements would he hurl yeall! Alack-a-day, the good Lord Luigi reigns not here in these sadtimes."
"The good Lord Luigi?"
"Aye, none other, please your worship. In his day, the poor rejoiced inplenty and the rich he did oppress; taxes were not known, the fathers ofthe church waxed fat upon his bounty; travelers went and came, with noneto interfere; and whosoever would, might tarry in his halls in cordialwelcome, and eat his bread and drink his wine, withal. But woe is me!some two and forty years agone the good count rode hence to fight forHoly Cross, and many a year hath flown since word or token have we had ofhim. Men say his bones lie bleaching in the fields of Palestine."
"And now?"
"Now! God 'a mercy, the cruel Leonardo lords it in the castle. Hewrings taxes from the poor; he robs all travelers that journey by hisgates; he spends his days in feuds and murders, and his nights in reveland debauch; he roasts the fathers of the church upon his kitchen spits,and enjoyeth the same, calling it pastime. These thirty years Luigi'scountess hath not been seen by any in all this land, and manywhisper that she pines in the dungeons of the castle for that she willnot wed with Leonardo, saying her dear lord still liveth and that shewill die ere she prove false to him. They whisper likewise that herdaughter is a prisoner as well. Nay, good jugglers, seek ye refreshmentother wheres. 'Twere better that ye perished in a Christian way thanthat ye plunged from off yon dizzy tower. Give ye good-day."
"God keep ye, gentle knave--farewell."
But heedless of the peasant's warning, the players moved straightwaytoward the castle.
Word was brought to Count Leonardo that a company of mountebanks besoughthis hospitality.
"'Tis well. Dispose of them in the customary manner. Yet stay! I haveneed of them. Let them come hither. Later, cast them from thebattlements--or--how many priests have ye on hand?"
"The day's results are meagre, good my lord. An abbot and a dozenbeggarly friars is all we have."
"Hell and furies! Is the estate going to seed? Send hither themountebanks. Afterward, broil them with the priests."
The robed and close-cowled harlequins entered. The grim Leonardo sate instate at the head of his council board. Ranged up and down the hall oneither hand stood near a hundred men-at-arms.
"Ha, villains!" quoth the count, "What can ye do to earn the hospitalityye crave."
"Dread lord and mighty, crowded audiences have greeted our humble effortswith rapturous applause. Among our body count we the versatile andtalented Ugolino; the justly celebrated Rodolpho; the gifted andaccomplished Roderigo; the management have spared neither pains norexpense--"
"S'death! What can ye do? Curb thy prating tongue."
"Good my lord, in acrobatic feats, in practice with the dumb-bells, inbalancing and ground and lofty tumbling are we versed--and sith yourhighness asketh me, I venture here to publish that in the truly marvelousand entertaining Zampillaerostation--"
"Gag him! throttle him! Body of Bacchus! am I a dog that I am to beassailed with polysyllabled blasphemy like to this? But hold! Lucretia,Isabel, stand forth! Sirrah, behold this dame, this weeping wench. Thefirst I marry, within the hour; the other shall dry her tears or feed thevultures. Thou and thy vagabonds shall crown the wedding with thymerry-makings. Fetch hither the priest!"
The dame sprang toward the chief player.
"O, save me!" she cried; "save me from a fate far worse than death!Behold these sad eyes, these sunken cheeks, this withered frame! Seethou the wreck this fiend hath made, and let thy heart be moved withpity! Look upon this damosel; note her wasted form, her halting step,her bloomless cheeks where youth should blush and happiness exult insmiles! Hear us and have compassion. This monster was my husband'sbrother. He who should have been our shield against all harm, hath keptus shut within the noisome caverns of his donjon-keep for lo these thirtyyears. And for what crime? None other than that I would not belie mytroth, root out my strong love for him who marches with the legions ofthe cross in Holy Land, (for O, he is not dead!) and wed with him! Saveus, O, save thy persecuted suppliants!"
She flung herself at his feet and clasped his knees.
"Ha!-ha!-ha!" shouted the brutal Leonardo. "Priest, to thy work!" andhe dragged the weeping dame from her refuge. "Say, once for all, willyou be mine?--for by my halidome, that breath that uttereth thy refusalshall be thy last on earth!"
"NE-VER?"
"Then die!" and the sword leaped from its scabbard.
Quicker than thought, quicker than the lightning's flash, fifty monkishhabits disappeared, and fifty knights in splendid armor stood revealed!fifty falchions gleamed in air above the men-at-arms, and brighter,fiercer than them all, flamed Excalibur aloft, and cleaving downwardstruck the brutal Leonardo's weapon from his grasp!
"A Luigi to the rescue! Whoop!"
"A Leonardo! 'tare an ouns!'"
"Oh, God, Oh, God, my husband!"
"Oh, God, Oh, God, my wife!"
"My father!"
"My precious!" [Tableau.]===Count Luigi bound his usurping brother hand and foot. The practicedknights from Palestine made holyday sport of carving the awkwardmen-at-arms into chops and steaks. The victory was complete. Happinessreigned. The knights all married the daughter. Joy! wassail! finis!
"But what did they do with the wicked brother?"
"Oh nothing--only hanged him on that iron hook I was speaking of. By thechin."
"As how?"
"Passed it up through his gills into his mouth."
"Leave him there?"
"Couple of years."
"Ah--is--is he dead?"
"Six hundred and fifty years ago, or such a matter."
"Splendid legend--splendid lie--drive on."
We reached the quaint old fortified city of Bergamo, the renowned inhistory, some three-quarters of an hour before the train was ready tostart. The place has thirty or forty thousand inhabitants and isremarkable for being the birthplace of harlequin. When we discoveredthat, that legend of our driver took to itself a new interest in oureyes.
Rested and refreshed, we took the rail happy and contented. I shall nottarry to speak of the handsome Lago di Gardi; its stately castle thatholds in its stony bosom the secrets of an age so remote that eventradition goeth not back to it; the imposing mountain scenery thatennobles the landscape thereabouts; nor yet of ancient Padua or haughtyVerona; nor of their Montagues and Capulets, their famous balconies andtombs of Juliet and Romeo et al., but hurry straight to the ancient cityof the sea, the widowed bride of the Adriatic. It was a long, long ride.But toward evening, as we sat silent and hardly conscious of where wewere--subdued into that meditative calm that comes so surely after aconversational storm--some one shouted--"VENICE!"
And sure enough, afloat on the placid sea a league away, lay a greatcity, with its towers and domes and steeples drowsing in a golden mist ofsunset.
