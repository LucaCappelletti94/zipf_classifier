We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs,and frogs, and caterpillars, and one thing or another;and we like to got a hornet's nest, but we didn't. Thefamily was at home. We didn't give it right up, butstayed with them as long as we could; because weallowed we'd tire them out or they'd got to tire usout, and they done it. Then we got allycumpain andrubbed on the places, and was pretty near all rightagain, but couldn't set down convenient. And so wewent for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozengarters and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, andput it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day's work: andhungry? -- oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn't ablessed snake up there when we went back -- we didn'thalf tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, andleft. But it didn't matter much, because they wasstill on the premises somewheres. So we judged wecould get some of them again. No, there warn't noreal scarcity of snakes about the house for a consider-able spell. You'd see them dripping from the raftersand places every now and then; and they generlylanded in your plate, or down the back of your neck,and most of the time where you didn't want them.Well, they was handsome and striped, and there warn'tno harm in a million of them; but that never made nodifference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be thebreed what they might, and she couldn't stand themno way you could fix it; and every time one of themflopped down on her, it didn't make no difference whatshe was doing, she would just lay that work down andlight out. I never see such a woman. And you couldhear her whoop to Jericho. You couldn't get her totake a-holt of one of them with the tongs. And if sheturned over and found one in bed she would scrambleout and lift a howl that you would think the house wasafire. She disturbed the old man so that he said hecould most wish there hadn't ever been no snakescreated. Why, after every last snake had been goneclear out of the house for as much as a week AuntSally warn't over it yet; she warn't near over it; whenshe was setting thinking about something you couldtouch her on the back of her neck with a feather andshe would jump right out of her stockings. It wasvery curious. But Tom said all women was just so.He said they was made that way for some reason orother.
We got a licking every time one of our snakes comein her way, and she allowed these lickings warn't noth-ing to what she would do if we ever loaded up theplace again with them. I didn't mind the lickings,because they didn't amount to nothing; but I mindedthe trouble we had to lay in another lot. But we gotthem laid in, and all the other things; and you neversee a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd allswarm out for music and go for him. Jim didn't likethe spiders, and the spiders didn't like Jim; and sothey'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him.And he said that between the rats and the snakes andthe grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him,skasely; and when there was, a body couldn't sleep, itwas so lively, and it was always lively, he said, becauseTHEY never all slept at one time, but took turn about,so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck,and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch,so he always had one gang under him, in his way, andt'other gang having a circus over him, and if he gotup to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chanceat him as he crossed over. He said if he ever got outthis time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner again, not fora salary.
Well, by the end of three weeks everything was inpretty good shape. The shirt was sent in early, in apie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up andwrite a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; thepens was made, the inscriptions and so on was allcarved on the grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed intwo, and we had et up the sawdust, and it give us amost amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was allgoing to die, but didn't. It was the most undigestiblesawdust I ever see; and Tom said the same. But as Iwas saying, we'd got all the work done now, at last;and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainlyJim. The old man had wrote a couple of times to theplantation below Orleans to come and get their run-away nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because therewarn't no such plantation; so he allowed he would ad-vertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers;and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give methe cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose.So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.
"What's them?" I says.
"Warnings to the people that something is up.Sometimes it's done one way, sometimes another.But there's always somebody spying around that givesnotice to the governor of the castle. When LouisXVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries a servant-girl done it. It's a very good way, and so is thenonnamous letters. We'll use them both. And it'susual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes withhim, and she stays in, and he slides out in her clothes.We'll do that, too."
"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to WARNanybody for that something's up? Let them find itout for themselves -- it's their lookout."
"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.It's the way they've acted from the very start -- leftus to do EVERYTHING. They're so confiding and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all. So ifwe don't GIVE them notice there won't be nobody nornothing to interfere with us, and so after all our hardwork and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat;won't amount to nothing -- won't be nothing TO it."
"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like."
"Shucks!" he says, and looked disgusted. So Isays:
"But I ain't going to make no complaint. Anyway that suits you suits me. What you going to doabout the servant-girl?"
"You'll be her. You slide in, in the middle of thenight, and hook that yaller girl's frock."
"Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning;because, of course, she prob'bly hain't got any butthat one."
"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes,to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under thefront door."
"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it justas handy in my own togs."
"You wouldn't look like a servant-girl THEN, wouldyou?"
"No, but there won't be nobody to see what I looklike, ANYWAY."
"That ain't got nothing to do with it. The thingfor us to do is just to do our DUTY, and not worryabout whether anybody SEES us do it or not. Hain'tyou got no principle at all?"
"All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl. Who's Jim's mother?"
"I'm his mother. I'll hook a gown from AuntSally."
"Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin whenme and Jim leaves."
"Not much. I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of strawand lay it on his bed to represent his mother in dis-guise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's gown off ofme and wear it, and we'll all evade together. When aprisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion. It'salways called so when a king escapes, f'rinstance.And the same with a king's son; it don't make no differ-ence whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one."
So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and Ismouched the yaller wench's frock that night, and putit on, and shoved it under the front door, the way Tomtold me to. It said:
   Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout.                                        UNKNOWN FRIEND.
Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawedin blood, of a skull and crossbones on the front door;and next night another one of a coffin on the backdoor. I never see a family in such a sweat. Theycouldn't a been worse scared if the place had a beenfull of ghosts laying for them behind everything andunder the beds and shivering through the air. If adoor banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said"ouch!" if anything fell, she jumped and said"ouch!" if you happened to touch her, when shewarn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't facenoway and be satisfied, because she allowed there wassomething behind her every time -- so she was alwaysa-whirling around sudden, and saying "ouch," andbefore she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl backagain, and say it again; and she was afraid to go to bed,but she dasn't set up. So the thing was workingvery well, Tom said; he said he never see a thingwork more satisfactory. He said it showed it wasdone right.
So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the verynext morning at the streak of dawn we got anotherletter ready, and was wondering what we better do withit, because we heard them say at supper they wasgoing to have a nigger on watch at both doors allnight. Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spyaround; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.This letter said:
   Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend. There   is a desprate gang of cut-throats from over in the   Indian Territory going to steal your runaway   nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare   you so as you will stay in the house and not bother   them. I am one of the gang, but have got religgion   and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again,   and will betray the helish design. They will sneak   down from northards, along the fence, at midnight   exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger's   cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow   a tin horn if I see any danger; but stead of that I   will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not   blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains   loose, you slip there and lock them in, and can   kill them at your leasure. Don't do anything but   just the way I am telling you; if you do they will   suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I   do not wish any reward but to know I have done the   right thing.                                   UNKNOWN FRIEND.
