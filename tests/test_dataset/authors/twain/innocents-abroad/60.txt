Ten or eleven o'clock found us coming down to breakfast one morning inCadiz. They told us the ship had been lying at anchor in the harbor twoor three hours. It was time for us to bestir ourselves. The ship couldwait only a little while because of the quarantine. We were soon onboard, and within the hour the white city and the pleasant shores ofSpain sank down behind the waves and passed out of sight. We had seen noland fade from view so regretfully.
It had long ago been decided in a noisy public meeting in the main cabinthat we could not go to Lisbon, because we must surely be quarantinedthere. We did every thing by mass-meeting, in the good old national way,from swapping off one empire for another on the programme of the voyagedown to complaining of the cookery and the scarcity of napkins. I amreminded, now, of one of these complaints of the cookery made by apassenger. The coffee had been steadily growing more and more execrablefor the space of three weeks, till at last it had ceased to be coffeealtogether and had assumed the nature of mere discolored water--so thisperson said. He said it was so weak that it was transparent an inch indepth around the edge of the cup. As he approached the table one morninghe saw the transparent edge--by means of his extraordinary vision longbefore he got to his seat. He went back and complained in a high-handedway to Capt. Duncan. He said the coffee was disgraceful. The Captainshowed his. It seemed tolerably good. The incipient mutineer was moreoutraged than ever, then, at what he denounced as the partiality shownthe captain's table over the other tables in the ship. He flourishedback and got his cup and set it down triumphantly, and said:
"Just try that mixture once, Captain Duncan."
He smelt it--tasted it--smiled benignantly--then said:
"It is inferior--for coffee--but it is pretty fair tea."
The humbled mutineer smelt it, tasted it, and returned to his seat. Hehad made an egregious ass of himself before the whole ship. He did it nomore. After that he took things as they came. That was me.
The old-fashioned ship-life had returned, now that we were no longer insight of land. For days and days it continued just the same, one daybeing exactly like another, and, to me, every one of them pleasant. Atlast we anchored in the open roadstead of Funchal, in the beautifulislands we call the Madeiras.
The mountains looked surpassingly lovely, clad as they were in living,green; ribbed with lava ridges; flecked with white cottages; riven bydeep chasms purple with shade; the great slopes dashed with sunshine andmottled with shadows flung from the drifting squadrons of the sky, andthe superb picture fitly crowned by towering peaks whose fronts wereswept by the trailing fringes of the clouds.
But we could not land. We staid all day and looked, we abused the manwho invented quarantine, we held half a dozen mass-meetings and crammedthem full of interrupted speeches, motions that fell still-born,amendments that came to nought and resolutions that died from sheerexhaustion in trying to get before the house. At night we set sail.
We averaged four mass-meetings a week for the voyage--we seemed always inlabor in this way, and yet so often fallaciously that whenever at longintervals we were safely delivered of a resolution, it was cause forpublic rejoicing, and we hoisted the flag and fired a salute.
Days passed--and nights; and then the beautiful Bermudas rose out of thesea, we entered the tortuous channel, steamed hither and thither amongthe bright summer islands, and rested at last under the flag of Englandand were welcome. We were not a nightmare here, where were civilizationand intelligence in place of Spanish and Italian superstition, dirt anddread of cholera. A few days among the breezy groves, the flowergardens, the coral caves, and the lovely vistas of blue water that wentcurving in and out, disappearing and anon again appearing through junglewalls of brilliant foliage, restored the energies dulled by long drowsingon the ocean, and fitted us for our final cruise--our little run of athousand miles to New York--America--HOME.
We bade good-bye to "our friends the Bermudians," as our programme hathit--the majority of those we were most intimate with were negroes--andcourted the great deep again. I said the majority. We knew more negroesthan white people, because we had a deal of washing to be done, but wemade some most excellent friends among the whites, whom it will be apleasant duty to hold long in grateful remembrance.
We sailed, and from that hour all idling ceased. Such another system ofoverhauling, general littering of cabins and packing of trunks we had notseen since we let go the anchor in the harbor of Beirout. Every body wasbusy. Lists of all purchases had to be made out, and values attached, tofacilitate matters at the custom-house. Purchases bought by bulk inpartnership had to be equitably divided, outstanding debts canceled,accounts compared, and trunks, boxes and packages labeled. All day longthe bustle and confusion continued.
And now came our first accident. A passenger was running through agangway, between decks, one stormy night, when he caught his foot in theiron staple of a door that had been heedlessly left off a hatchway, andthe bones of his leg broke at the ancle. It was our first seriousmisfortune. We had traveled much more than twenty thousand miles, byland and sea, in many trying climates, without a single hurt, without aserious case of sickness and without a death among five and sixtypassengers. Our good fortune had been wonderful. A sailor had jumpedoverboard at Constantinople one night, and was seen no more, but it wassuspected that his object was to desert, and there was a slim chance, atleast, that he reached the shore. But the passenger list was complete.There was no name missing from the register.
At last, one pleasant morning, we steamed up the harbor of New York, allon deck, all dressed in Christian garb--by special order, for there was alatent disposition in some quarters to come out as Turks--and amid awaving of handkerchiefs from welcoming friends, the glad pilgrims notedthe shiver of the decks that told that ship and pier had joined handsagain and the long, strange cruise was over. Amen.
