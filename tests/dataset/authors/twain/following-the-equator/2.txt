When in doubt, tell the truth. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
About four days out from Victoria we plunged into hot weather, and allthe male passengers put on white linen clothes. One or two days later wecrossed the 25th parallel of north latitude, and then, by order, theofficers of the ship laid away their blue uniforms and came out in whitelinen ones. All the ladies were in white by this time. This prevalenceof snowy costumes gave the promenade deck an invitingly cool, andcheerful and picnicky aspect.
From my diary:
There are several sorts of ills in the world from which a person cannever escape altogether, let him journey as far as he will. One escapesfrom one breed of an ill only to encounter another breed of it. We havecome far from the snake liar and the fish liar, and there was rest andpeace in the thought; but now we have reached the realm of the boomerangliar, and sorrow is with us once more. The first officer has seen a mantry to escape from his enemy by getting behind a tree; but the enemy senthis boomerang sailing into the sky far above and beyond the tree; then itturned, descended, and killed the man. The Australian passenger has seenthis thing done to two men, behind two trees--and by the one arrow. Thisbeing received with a large silence that suggested doubt, he buttressedit with the statement that his brother once saw the boomerang kill a birdaway off a hundred yards and bring it to the thrower. But these are illswhich must be borne. There is no other way.
The talk passed from the boomerang to dreams--usually a fruitful subject,afloat or ashore--but this time the output was poor. Then it passed toinstances of extraordinary memory--with better results. Blind Tom, thenegro pianist, was spoken of, and it was said that he could accuratelyplay any piece of music, howsoever long and difficult, after hearing itonce; and that six months later he could accurately play it again,without having touched it in the interval. One of the most striking ofthe stories told was furnished by a gentleman who had served on the staffof the Viceroy of India. He read the details from his note-book, andexplained that he had written them down, right after the consummation ofthe incident which they described, because he thought that if he did notput them down in black and white he might presently come to think he haddreamed them or invented them.
The Viceroy was making a progress, and among the shows offered by theMaharajah of Mysore for his entertainment was a memory-exhibition.The Viceroy and thirty gentlemen of his suite sat in a row, and thememory-expert, a high-caste Brahmin, was brought in and seated on thefloor in front of them. He said he knew but two languages, the Englishand his own, but would not exclude any foreign tongue from the tests tobe applied to his memory. Then he laid before the assemblage his program--a sufficiently extraordinary one. He proposed that one gentlemanshould give him one word of a foreign sentence, and tell him its place inthe sentence. He was furnished with the French word 'est', and was toldit was second in a sentence of three words. The next, gentleman gave himthe German word 'verloren' and said it was the third in a sentence offour words. He asked the next gentleman for one detail in a sum inaddition; another for one detail in a sum of subtraction; others forsingle details in mathematical problems of various kinds; he got them.Intermediates gave him single words from sentences in Greek, Latin,Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and other languages, and told him theirplaces in the sentences. When at last everybody had furnished him asingle rag from a foreign sentence or a figure from a problem, he wentover the ground again, and got a second word and a second figure and wastold their places in the sentences and the sums; and so on and so on. Hewent over the ground again and again until he had collected all the partsof the sums and all the parts of the sentences--and all in disorder, ofcourse, not in their proper rotation. This had occupied two hours.
The Brahmin now sat silent and thinking, a while, then began and repeatedall the sentences, placing the words in their proper order, and untangledthe disordered arithmetical problems and gave accurate answers to themall.
In the beginning he had asked the company to throw almonds at him duringthe two hours, he to remember how many each gentleman had thrown; butnone were thrown, for the Viceroy said that the test would be asufficiently severe strain without adding that burden to it.
General Grant had a fine memory for all kinds of things, including evennames and faces, and I could have furnished an instance of it if I hadthought of it. The first time I ever saw him was early in his first termas President. I had just arrived in Washington from the Pacific coast, astranger and wholly unknown to the public, and was passing the WhiteHouse one morning when I met a friend, a Senator from Nevada. He askedme if I would like to see the President. I said I should be very glad;so we entered. I supposed that the President would be in the midst of acrowd, and that I could look at him in peace and security from adistance, as another stray cat might look at another king. But it was inthe morning, and the Senator was using a privilege of his office which Ihad not heard of--the privilege of intruding upon the Chief Magistrate'sworking hours. Before I knew it, the Senator and I were in the presence,and there was none there but we three. General Grant got slowly up fromhis table, put his pen down, and stood before me with the iron expressionof a man who had not smiled for seven years, and was not intending tosmile for another seven. He looked me steadily in the eyes--mine lostconfidence and fell. I had never confronted a great man before, and wasin a miserable state of funk and inefficiency. The Senator said:--
"Mr. President, may I have the privilege of introducing Mr. Clemens?"
The President gave my hand an unsympathetic wag and dropped it. He didnot say a word but just stood. In my trouble I could not think ofanything to say, I merely wanted to resign. There was an awkward pause,a dreary pause, a horrible pause. Then I thought of something, andlooked up into that unyielding face, and said timidly:--
"Mr. President, I--I am embarrassed. Are you?"
His face broke--just a little--a wee glimmer, the momentary flicker of asummer-lightning smile, seven years ahead of time--and I was out and goneas soon as it was.
Ten years passed away before I saw him the second time. Meantime I wasbecome better known; and was one of the people appointed to respond totoasts at the banquet given to General Grant in Chicago--by the Army ofthe Tennessee when he came back from his tour around the world. Iarrived late at night and got up late in the morning. All the corridorsof the hotel were crowded with people waiting to get a glimpse of GeneralGrant when he should pass to the place whence he was to review the greatprocession. I worked my way by the suite of packed drawing-rooms, and atthe corner of the house I found a window open where there was a roomyplatform decorated with flags, and carpeted. I stepped out on it, andsaw below me millions of people blocking all the streets, and othermillions caked together in all the windows and on all the house-topsaround. These masses took me for General Grant, and broke into volcanicexplosions and cheers; but it was a good place to see the procession, andI stayed. Presently I heard the distant blare of military music, and farup the street I saw the procession come in sight, cleaving its waythrough the huzzaing multitudes, with Sheridan, the most martialfigure of the War, riding at its head in the dress uniform of aLieutenant-General.
And now General Grant, arm-in-arm with Major Carter Harrison, stepped outon the platform, followed two and two by the badged and uniformedreception committee. General Grant was looking exactly as he had lookedupon that trying occasion of ten years before--all iron and bronzeself-possession. Mr. Harrison came over and led me to the General andformally introduced me. Before I could put together the proper remark,General Grant said--
"Mr. Clemens, I am not embarrassed. Are you?"--and that littleseven-year smile twinkled across his face again.
Seventeen years have gone by since then, and to-day, in New York, thestreets are a crush of people who are there to honor the remains of thegreat soldier as they pass to their final resting-place under themonument; and the air is heavy with dirges and the boom of artillery, andall the millions of America are thinking of the man who restored theUnion and the flag, and gave to democratic government a new lease oflife, and, as we may hope and do believe, a permanent place among thebeneficent institutions of men.
We had one game in the ship which was a good time-passer--at least it wasat night in the smoking-room when the men were getting freshened up fromthe day's monotonies and dullnesses. It was the completing ofnon-complete stories. That is to say, a man would tell all of a storyexcept the finish, then the others would try to supply the ending out oftheir own invention. When every one who wanted a chance had had it, theman who had introduced the story would give it its original ending--thenyou could take your choice. Sometimes the new endings turned out to bebetter than the old one. But the story which called out the mostpersistent and determined and ambitious effort was one which had noending, and so there was nothing to compare the new-made endings with.The man who told it said he could furnish the particulars up to a certainpoint only, because that was as much of the tale as he knew. He had readit in a volume of `sketches twenty-five years ago, and was interruptedbefore the end was reached. He would give any one fifty dollars whowould finish the story to the satisfaction of a jury to be appointed byourselves. We appointed a jury and wrestled with the tale. We inventedplenty of endings, but the jury voted them all down. The jury was right.It was a tale which the author of it may possibly have completedsatisfactorily, and if he really had that good fortune I would like toknow what the ending was. Any ordinary man will find that the story'sstrength is in its middle, and that there is apparently no way totransfer it to the close, where of course it ought to be. In substancethe storiette was as follows:
John Brown, aged thirty-one, good, gentle, bashful, timid, lived in aquiet village in Missouri. He was superintendent of the PresbyterianSunday-school. It was but a humble distinction; still, it was his onlyofficial one, and he was modestly proud of it and was devoted to its workand its interests. The extreme kindliness of his nature was recognizedby all; in fact, people said that he was made entirely out of goodimpulses and bashfulness; that he could always be counted upon for helpwhen it was needed, and for bashfulness both when it was needed and whenit wasn't.
Mary Taylor, twenty-three, modest, sweet, winning, and in character andperson beautiful, was all in all to him. And he was very nearly all inall to her. She was wavering, his hopes were high. Her mother had beenin opposition from the first. But she was wavering, too; he couldsee it. She was being touched by his warm interest in her twocharity-proteges and by his contributions toward their support. Thesewere two forlorn and aged sisters who lived in a log hut in a lonelyplace up a cross road four miles from Mrs. Taylor's farm. One of thesisters was crazy, and sometimes a little violent, but not often.
At last the time seemed ripe for a final advance, and Brown gathered hiscourage together and resolved to make it. He would take along acontribution of double the usual size, and win the mother over; with heropposition annulled, the rest of the conquest would be sure and prompt.
He took to the road in the middle of a placid Sunday afternoon in thesoft Missourian summer, and he was equipped properly for his mission. Hewas clothed all in white linen, with a blue ribbon for a necktie, and hehad on dressy tight boots. His horse and buggy were the finest that thelivery stable could furnish. The lap robe was of white linen, it wasnew, and it had a hand-worked border that could not be rivaled in thatregion for beauty and elaboration.
When he was four miles out on the lonely road and was walking his horseover a wooden bridge, his straw hat blew off and fell in the creek, andfloated down and lodged against a bar. He did not quite know what to do.He must have the hat, that was manifest; but how was he to get it?
Then he had an idea. The roads were empty, nobody was stirring. Yes, hewould risk it. He led the horse to the roadside and set it to croppingthe grass; then he undressed and put his clothes in the buggy, petted thehorse a moment to secure its compassion and its loyalty, then hurried tothe stream. He swam out and soon had the hat. When he got to the top ofthe bank the horse was gone!
His legs almost gave way under him. The horse was walking leisurelyalong the road. Brown trotted after it, saying, "Whoa, whoa, there's agood fellow;" but whenever he got near enough to chance a jump for thebuggy, the horse quickened its pace a little and defeated him. And sothis went on, the naked man perishing with anxiety, and expecting everymoment to see people come in sight. He tagged on and on, imploring thehorse, beseeching the horse, till he had left a mile behind him, and wasclosing up on the Taylor premises; then at last he was successful, andgot into the buggy. He flung on his shirt, his necktie, and his coat;then reached for--but he was too late; he sat suddenly down and pulled upthe lap-robe, for he saw some one coming out of the gate--a woman; hethought. He wheeled the horse to the left, and struck briskly up thecross-road. It was perfectly straight, and exposed on both sides; butthere were woods and a sharp turn three miles ahead, and he was verygrateful when he got there. As he passed around the turn he slowed downto a walk, and reached for his tr---- too late again.
He had come upon Mrs. Enderby, Mrs. Glossop, Mrs. Taylor, and Mary.They were on foot, and seemed tired and excited. They came at once tothe buggy and shook hands, and all spoke at once, and said eagerly andearnestly, how glad they were that he was come, and how fortunate it was.And Mrs. Enderby said, impressively:
"It looks like an accident, his coming at such a time; but let no oneprofane it with such a name; he was sent--sent from on high."
They were all moved, and Mrs. Glossop said in an awed voice:
"Sarah Enderby, you never said a truer word in your life. This is noaccident, it is a special Providence. He was sent. He is an angel--anangel as truly as ever angel was--an angel of deliverance. I say angel,Sarah Enderby, and will have no other word. Don't let any one ever sayto me again, that there's no such thing as special Providences; for ifthis isn't one, let them account for it that can."
"I know it's so," said Mrs. Taylor, fervently. "John Brown, I couldworship you; I could go down on my knees to you. Didn't something tellyou?--didn't you feel that you were sent? I could kiss the hem of yourlaprobe."
He was not able to speak; he was helpless with shame and fright. Mrs.Taylor went on:
"Why, just look at it all around, Julia Glossop. Any person can see thehand of Providence in it. Here at noon what do we see? We see the smokerising. I speak up and say, 'That's the Old People's cabin afire.'Didn't I, Julia Glossop?"
"The very words you said, Nancy Taylor. I was as close to you as I amnow, and I heard them. You may have said hut instead of cabin, but insubstance it's the same. And you were looking pale, too."
"Pale? I was that pale that if--why, you just compare it with thislaprobe. Then the next thing I said was, 'Mary Taylor, tell the hiredman to rig up the team-we'll go to the rescue.' And she said, 'Mother,don't you know you told him he could drive to see his people, and stayover Sunday?' And it was just so. I declare for it, I had forgotten it.'Then,' said I, 'we'll go afoot.' And go we did. And found SarahEnderby on the road."
"And we all went together," said Mrs. Enderby. "And found the cabin setfire to and burnt down by the crazy one, and the poor old things so oldand feeble that they couldn't go afoot. And we got them to a shady placeand made them as comfortable as we could, and began to wonder which wayto turn to find some way to get them conveyed to Nancy Taylor's house.And I spoke up and said--now what did I say? Didn't I say, 'Providencewill provide'?"
"Why sure as you live, so you did! I had forgotten it."
"So had I," said Mrs. Glossop and Mrs. Taylor; "but you certainly saidit. Now wasn't that remarkable?"
"Yes, I said it. And then we went to Mr. Moseley's, two miles, and allof them were gone to the camp meeting over on Stony Fork; and then wecame all the way back, two miles, and then here, another mile--andProvidence has provided. You see it yourselves."
They gazed at each other awe-struck, and lifted their hands and said inunison:
"It's per-fectly wonderful."
"And then," said Mrs. Glossop, "what do you think we had better do letMr. Brown drive the Old People to Nancy Taylor's one at a time, or putboth of them in the buggy, and him lead the horse?"
Brown gasped.
"Now, then, that's a question," said Mrs. Enderby. "You see, we are alltired out, and any way we fix it it's going to be difficult. For if Mr.Brown takes both of them, at least one of us must, go back to help him,for he can't load them into the buggy by himself, and they so helpless."
"That is so," said Mrs. Taylor. "It doesn't look-oh, how would this do?--one of us drive there with Mr. Brown, and the rest of you go along tomy house and get things ready. I'll go with him. He and I together canlift one of the Old People into the buggy; then drive her to my houseand----
"But who will take care of the other one?" said Mrs. Enderby. "Wemusn't leave her there in the woods alone, you know--especially the crazyone. There and back is eight miles, you see."
They had all been sitting on the grass beside the buggy for a while, now,trying to rest their weary bodies. They fell silent a moment or two, andstruggled in thought over the baffling situation; then Mrs. Enderbybrightened and said:
"I think I've got the idea, now. You see, we can't walk any more. Thinkwhat we've done: four miles there, two to Moseley's, is six, then back tohere--nine miles since noon, and not a bite to eat; I declare I don't seehow we've done it; and as for me, I am just famishing. Now, somebody'sgot to go back, to help Mr. Brown--there's no getting mound that; butwhoever goes has got to ride, not walk. So my idea is this: one of us toride back with Mr. Brown, then ride to Nancy Taylor's house with one ofthe Old People, leaving Mr. Brown to keep the other old one company, youall to go now to Nancy's and rest and wait; then one of you drive backand get the other one and drive her to Nancy's, and Mr. Brown walk."
"Splendid!" they all cried. "Oh, that will do--that will answerperfectly." And they all said that Mrs. Enderby had the best head forplanning, in the company; and they said that they wondered that theyhadn't thought of this simple plan themselves. They hadn't meant to takeback the compliment, good simple souls, and didn't know they had done it.After a consultation it was decided that Mrs. Enderby should drive backwith Brown, she being entitled to the distinction because she hadinvented the plan. Everything now being satisfactorily arranged andsettled, the ladies rose, relieved and happy, and brushed down theirgowns, and three of them started homeward; Mrs. Enderby set her foot onthe buggy-step and was about to climb in, when Brown found a remnant ofhis voice and gasped out--
"Please Mrs. Enderby, call them back--I am very weak; I can't walk, Ican't, indeed."
"Why, dear Mr. Brown! You do look pale; I am ashamed of myself that Ididn't notice it sooner. Come back-all of you! Mr. Brown is not well.Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Brown?--I'm real sorry. Are youin pain?"
"No, madam, only weak; I am not sick, but only just weak--lately; notlong, but just lately."
The others came back, and poured out their sympathies and commiserations,and were full of self-reproaches for not having noticed how pale he was.
And they at once struck out a new plan, and soon agreed that it was byfar the best of all. They would all go to Nancy Taylor's house and seeto Brown's needs first. He could lie on the sofa in the parlor, andwhile Mrs. Taylor and Mary took care of him the other two ladies wouldtake the buggy and go and get one of the Old People, and leave one ofthemselves with the other one, and----
By this time, without any solicitation, they were at the horse's head andwere beginning to turn him around. The danger was imminent, but Brownfound his voice again and saved himself. He said--
"But ladies, you are overlooking something which makes the planimpracticable. You see, if you bring one of them home, and one remainsbehind with the other, there will be three persons there when one of youcomes back for that other, for some one must drive the buggy back, andthree can't come home in it."
They all exclaimed, "Why, sure-ly, that is so!" and they were, allperplexed again.
"Dear, dear, what can we do?" said Mrs. Glossop; "it is the mostmixed-up thing that ever was. The fox and the goose and the corn andthings--Oh, dear, they are nothing to it."
They sat wearily down once more, to further torture their tormented headsfor a plan that would work. Presently Mary offered a plan; it was herfirst effort. She said:
"I am young and strong, and am refreshed, now. Take Mr. Brown to ourhouse, and give him help--you see how plainly he needs it. I will goback and take care of the Old People; I can be there in twenty minutes.You can go on and do what you first started to do--wait on the main roadat our house until somebody comes along with a wagon; then send and bringaway the three of us. You won't have to wait long; the farmers will soonbe coming back from town, now. I will keep old Polly patient and cheeredup--the crazy one doesn't need it."
This plan was discussed and accepted; it seemed the best that could bedone, in the circumstances, and the Old People must be gettingdiscouraged by this time.
Brown felt relieved, and was deeply thankful. Let him once get to themain road and he would find a way to escape.
Then Mrs. Taylor said:
"The evening chill will be coming on, pretty soon, and those poor oldburnt-out things will need some kind of covering. Take the lap-robe withyou, dear."
"Very well, Mother, I will."
She stepped to the buggy and put out her hand to take it----
That was the end of the tale. The passenger who told it said that whenhe read the story twenty-five years ago in a train he was interrupted atthat point--the train jumped off a bridge.
At first we thought we could finish the story quite easily, and we set towork with confidence; but it soon began to appear that it was not asimple thing, but difficult and baffling. This was on account of Brown'scharacter--great generosity and kindliness, but complicated with unusualshyness and diffidence, particularly in the presence of ladies. Therewas his love for Mary, in a hopeful state but not yet secure--just in acondition, indeed, where its affair must be handled with great tact, andno mistakes made, no offense given. And there was the mother wavering,half willing-by adroit and flawless diplomacy to be won over, now, orperhaps never at all. Also, there were the helpless Old People yonder inthe woods waiting-their fate and Brown's happiness to be determined bywhat Brown should do within the next two seconds. Mary was reaching forthe lap-robe; Brown must decide-there was no time to be lost.
Of course none but a happy ending of the story would be accepted by thejury; the finish must find Brown in high credit with the ladies, hisbehavior without blemish, his modesty unwounded, his character for selfsacrifice maintained, the Old People rescued through him, theirbenefactor, all the party proud of him, happy in him, his praises on alltheir tongues.
We tried to arrange this, but it was beset with persistent andirreconcilable difficulties. We saw that Brown's shyness would not allowhim to give up the lap-robe. This would offend Mary and her mother; andit would surprise the other ladies, partly because this stinginess towardthe suffering Old People would be out of character with Brown, and partlybecause he was a special Providence and could not properly act so. Ifasked to explain his conduct, his shyness would not allow him to tell thetruth, and lack of invention and practice would find him incapable ofcontriving a lie that would wash. We worked at the troublesome problemuntil three in the morning.
Meantime Mary was still reaching for the lap-robe. We gave it up, anddecided to let her continue to reach. It is the reader's privilege todetermine for himself how the thing came out.
