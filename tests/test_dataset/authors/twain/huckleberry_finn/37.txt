And when she come she was hot and red and cross,and couldn't hardly wait for the blessing; and thenshe went to sluicing out coffee with one hand andcracking the handiest child's head with her thimblewith the other, and says:
"I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it doesbeat all what HAS become of your other shirt."
My heart fell down amongst my lungs and liversand things, and a hard piece of corn-crust started downmy throat after it and got met on the road with acough, and was shot across the table, and took oneof the children in the eye and curled him up like afishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of awarwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around thegills, and it all amounted to a considerable state ofthings for about a quarter of a minute or as much asthat, and I would a sold out for half price if there wasa bidder. But after that we was all right again -- itwas the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kindof cold. Uncle Silas he says:
"It's most uncommon curious, I can't understandit. I know perfectly well I took it OFF, because --"
"Because you hain't got but one ON. Just LISTEN atthe man! I know you took it off, and know it by abetter way than your wool-gethering memory, too,because it was on the clo's-line yesterday -- I see itthere myself. But it's gone, that's the long and theshort of it, and you'll just have to change to a redflann'l one till I can get time to make a new one.And it 'll be the third I've made in two years. It justkeeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts; andwhatever you do manage to DO with 'm all is more'n Ican make out. A body 'd think you WOULD learn totake some sort of care of 'em at your time of life."
"I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But itoughtn't to be altogether my fault, because, you know,I don't see them nor have nothing to do with themexcept when they're on me; and I don't believe I'veever lost one of them OFF of me."
"Well, it ain't YOUR fault if you haven't, Silas;you'd a done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirtain't all that's gone, nuther. Ther's a spoon gone;and THAT ain't all. There was ten, and now ther's onlynine. The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calfnever took the spoon, THAT'S certain."
"Why, what else is gone, Sally?"
"Ther's six CANDLES gone -- that's what. The ratscould a got the candles, and I reckon they did; Iwonder they don't walk off with the whole place, theway you're always going to stop their holes and don'tdo it; and if they warn't fools they'd sleep in yourhair, Silas -- YOU'D never find it out; but you can't laythe SPOON on the rats, and that I know."
"Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it;I've been remiss; but I won't let to-morrow go bywithout stopping up them holes."
"Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do. MatildaAngelina Araminta PHELPS!"
Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatchesher claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling aroundany. Just then the nigger woman steps on to thepassage, and says:
"Missus, dey's a sheet gone."
"A SHEET gone! Well, for the land's sake!"
"I'll stop up them holes to-day," says Uncle Silas,looking sorrowful.
"Oh, DO shet up! -- s'pose the rats took the SHEET?WHERE'S it gone, Lize?"
"Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally.She wuz on de clo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone:she ain' dah no mo' now."
"I reckon the world IS coming to an end. I NEVERsee the beat of it in all my born days. A shirt, and asheet, and a spoon, and six can --"
"Missus," comes a young yaller wench, "dey's abrass cannelstick miss'n."
"Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skilletto ye!"
Well, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for achance; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for thewoods till the weather moderated. She kept a-ragingright along, running her insurrection all by herself,and everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and atlast Uncle Silas, looking kind of foolish, fishes up thatspoon out of his pocket. She stopped, with her mouthopen and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I wasin Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, becauseshe says:
"It's JUST as I expected. So you had it in yourpocket all the time; and like as not you've got theother things there, too. How'd it get there?"
"I reely don't know, Sally," he says, kind ofapologizing, "or you know I would tell. I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before break-fast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing,meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so,because my Testament ain't in; but I'll go and see;and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know Ididn't put it in, and that will show that I laid theTestament down and took up the spoon, and --"
"Oh, for the land's sake! Give a body a rest!Go 'long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; anddon't come nigh me again till I've got back my peaceof mind."
I'D a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alonespeaking it out; and I'd a got up and obeyed her ifI'd a been dead. As we was passing through thesetting-room the old man he took up his hat, and theshingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merelypicked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and neversaid nothing, and went out. Tom see him do it, andremembered about the spoon, and says:
"Well, it ain't no use to send things by HIM nomore, he ain't reliable." Then he says: "But hedone us a good turn with the spoon, anyway, withoutknowing it, and so we'll go and do him one withoutHIM knowing it -- stop up his rat-holes."
There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, andit took us a whole hour, but we done the job tight andgood and shipshape. Then we heard steps on thestairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and herecomes the old man, with a candle in one hand and abundle of stuff in t'other, looking as absent-minded asyear before last. He went a mooning around, first toone rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to themall. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking. Then he turns offslow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying:
"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when Idone it. I could show her now that I warn't to blameon account of the rats. But never mind -- let it go. Ireckon it wouldn't do no good."
And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and thenwe left. He was a mighty nice old man. Andalways is.
Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do fora spoon, but he said we'd got to have it; so he took athink. When he had ciphered it out he told me howwe was to do; then we went and waited around thespoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and thenTom went to counting the spoons and laying them outto one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, andTom says:
"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoonsYET."
She says:
"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me. Iknow better, I counted 'm myself."
"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can'tmake but nine."
She looked out of all patience, but of course shecome to count -- anybody would.
"I declare to gracious ther' AIN'T but nine!" shesays. "Why, what in the world -- plague TAKE thethings, I'll count 'm again."
So I slipped back the one I had, and when she gotdone counting, she says:
"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's TEN now!"and she looked huffy and bothered both. But Tomsays:
"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten."
"You numskull, didn't you see me COUNT 'm?"
"I know, but --"
"Well, I'll count 'm AGAIN."
So I smouched one, and they come out nine, sameas the other time. Well, she WAS in a tearing way --just a-trembling all over, she was so mad. But shecounted and counted till she got that addled she'd startto count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so,three times they come out right, and three times theycome out wrong. Then she grabbed up the basketand slammed it across the house and knocked the catgalley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her havesome peace, and if we come bothering around heragain betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us. So wehad the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocketwhilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jimgot it all right, along with her shingle nail, beforenoon. We was very well satisfied with this business,and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble ittook, because he said NOW she couldn't ever countthem spoons twice alike again to save her life; andwouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she DID;and said that after she'd about counted her head offfor the next three days he judged she'd give it up andoffer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever countthem any more.
So we put the sheet back on the line that night, andstole one out of her closet; and kept on putting itback and stealing it again for a couple of days till shedidn't know how many sheets she had any more, andshe didn't CARE, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the restof her soul out about it, and wouldn't count themagain not to save her life; she druther die first.
So we was all right now, as to the shirt and thesheet and the spoon and the candles, by the help ofthe calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting; andas to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, itwould blow over by and by.
But that pie was a job; we had no end of troublewith that pie. We fixed it up away down in thewoods, and cooked it there; and we got it done atlast, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in oneday; and we had to use up three wash-pans full offlour before we got through, and we got burnt prettymuch all over, in places, and eyes put out with thesmoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing buta crust, and we couldn't prop it up right, and shewould always cave in. But of course we thought ofthe right way at last -- which was to cook the ladder,too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim thesecond night, and tore up the sheet all in little stringsand twisted them together, and long before daylight wehad a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with.We let on it took nine months to make it.
And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods,but it wouldn't go into the pie. Being made of awhole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for fortypies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over forsoup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We coulda had a whole dinner.
But we didn't need it. All we needed was justenough for the pie, and so we throwed the rest away.We didn't cook none of the pies in the wash-pan --afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had anoble brass warming-pan which he thought consider-able of, because it belonged to one of his ancesterswith a long wooden handle that come over from Eng-land with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower orone of them early ships and was hid away up garretwith a lot of other old pots and things that wasvaluable, not on account of being any account, be-cause they warn't, but on account of them beingrelicts, you know, and we snaked her out, private, andtook her down there, but she failed on the first pies,because we didn't know how, but she come up smilingon the last one. We took and lined her with dough,and set her in the coals, and loaded her up with ragrope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid,and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot,with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and infifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfac-tion to look at. But the person that et it would wantto fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for ifthat rope ladder wouldn't cramp him down to businessI don't know nothing what I'm talking about, and layhim in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time,too.
Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim'span; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom ofthe pan under the vittles; and so Jim got everythingall right, and as soon as he was by himself he bustedinto the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his strawtick, and scratched some marks on a tin plate andthrowed it out of the window-hole.
