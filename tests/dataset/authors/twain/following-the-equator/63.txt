The principal difference between a cat and a lie is that the cat has onlynine lives. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

April 20.--The cyclone of 1892 killed and crippled hundreds of people;it was accompanied by a deluge of rain, which drowned Port Louis andproduced a water famine.  Quite true; for it burst the reservoir and thewater-pipes; and for a time after the flood had disappeared there wasmuch distress from want of water.
This is the only place in the world where no breed of matches can standthe damp.  Only one match in 16 will light.
The roads are hard and smooth; some of the compounds are spacious, someof the bungalows commodious, and the roadways are walled by tall bamboohedges, trim and green and beautiful; and there are azalea hedges, too,both the white and the red; I never saw that before.
As to healthiness: I translate from to-day's (April 20) Merchants' andPlanters' Gazette, from the article of a regular contributor, "Carminge,"concerning the death of the nephew of a prominent citizen:
     "Sad and lugubrious existence, this which we lead in Mauritius; I     believe there is no other country in the world where one dies more     easily than among us.  The least indisposition becomes a mortal     malady; a simple headache develops into meningitis; a cold into     pneumonia, and presently, when we are least expecting it, death is a     guest in our home."
This daily paper has a meteorological report which tells you what theweather was day before yesterday.
One is clever pestered by a beggar or a peddler in this town, so far as Ican see.  This is pleasantly different from India.
April 22.  To such as believe that the quaint product called Frenchcivilization would be an improvement upon the civilization of New Guineaand the like, the snatching of Madagascar and the laying on of Frenchcivilization there will be fully justified.  But why did the Englishallow the French to have Madagascar?  Did she respect a theft of a coupleof centuries ago?  Dear me, robbery by European nations of each other'sterritories has never been a sin, is not a sin to-day.  To the severalcabinets the several political establishments of the world areclotheslines; and a large part of the official duty of these cabinets isto keep an eye on each other's wash and grab what they can of it asopportunity offers.  All the territorial possessions of all the politicalestablishments in the earth--including America, of course--consist ofpilferings from other people's wash.  No tribe, howsoever insignificant,and no nation, howsoever mighty, occupies a foot of land that was notstolen.  When the English, the French, and the Spaniards reached America,the Indian tribes had been raiding each other's territorial clothes-linesfor ages, and every acre of ground in the continent had been stolen andre-stolen 500 times.  The English, the French, and the Spaniards went towork and stole it all over again; and when that was satisfactorilyaccomplished they went diligently to work and stole it from each other.In Europe and Asia and Africa every acre of ground has been stolenseveral millions of times.  A crime persevered in a thousand centuriesceases to be a crime, and becomes a virtue.  This is the law of custom,and custom supersedes all other forms of law.  Christian governments areas frank to-day, as open and above-board, in discussing projects forraiding each other's clothes-lines as ever they were before the GoldenRule came smiling into this inhospitable world and couldn't get a night'slodging anywhere.  In 150 years England has beneficently retired garmentafter garment from the Indian lines, until there is hardly a rag of theoriginal wash left dangling anywhere.  In 800 years an obscuretribe of Muscovite savages has risen to the dazzling position ofLand-Robber-in-Chief; she found a quarter of the world hanging out to dryon a hundred parallels of latitude, and she scooped in the whole wash.She keeps a sharp eye on a multitude of little lines that stretch alongthe northern boundaries of India, and every now and then she snatches ahip-rag or a pair of pyjamas.  It is England's prospective property, andRussia knows it; but Russia cares nothing for that.  In fact, in our dayland-robbery, claim-jumping, is become a European governmental frenzy.Some have been hard at it in the borders of China, in Burma, in Siam, andthe islands of the sea; and all have been at it in Africa.  Africa hasbeen as coolly divided up and portioned out among the gang as if they hadbought it and paid for it.  And now straightway they are beginning theold game again--to steal each other's grabbings.  Germany found a vastslice of Central Africa with the English flag and the English missionaryand the English trader scattered all over it, but with certainformalities neglected--no signs up, "Keep off the grass,""Trespassers-forbidden," etc.--and she stepped in with a cold calm smileand put up the signs herself, and swept those English pioneers promptlyout of the country.
There is a tremendous point there.  It can be put into the form of amaxim: Get your formalities right--never mind about the moralities.
It was an impudent thing; but England had to put up with it.  Now, in thecase of Madagascar, the formalities had originally been observed, but byneglect they had fallen into desuetude ages ago.  England should havesnatched Madagascar from the French clothes-line.  Without an effort shecould have saved those harmless natives from the calamity of Frenchcivilization, and she did not do it.  Now it is too late.
The signs of the times show plainly enough what is going to happen.  Allthe savage lands in the world are going to be brought under subjection tothe Christian governments of Europe.  I am not sorry, but glad.  Thiscoming fate might have been a calamity to those savage peoples twohundred years ago; but now it will in some cases be a benefaction.  Thesooner the seizure is consummated, the better for the savages.
The dreary and dragging ages of bloodshed and disorder and oppressionwill give place to peace and order and the reign of law.  When oneconsiders what India was under her Hindoo and Mohammedan rulers, and whatshe is now; when he remembers the miseries of her millions then and theprotections and humanities which they enjoy now, he must concede that themost fortunate thing that has ever befallen that empire was theestablishment of British supremacy there.  The savage lands of the worldare to pass to alien possession, their peoples to the mercies of alienrulers.  Let us hope and believe that they will all benefit by thechange.
April 23.  "The first year they gather shells; the second year theygather shells and drink; the third year they do not gather shells." (Saidof immigrants to Mauritius.)
Population 375,000.  120 sugar factories.
Population 1851, 185,000.  The increase is due mainly to the introductionof Indian coolies.  They now apparently form the great majority of thepopulation.  They are admirable breeders; their homes are always hazywith children.  Great savers of money.  A British officer told me that inIndia he paid his servant 10 rupees a month, and he had 11 cousins,uncles, parents, etc., dependent upon him, and he supported them on hiswages.  These thrifty coolies are said to be acquiring land a trifle at atime, and cultivating it; and may own the island by and by.
The Indian women do very hard labor [for wages of (1/2 rupee) for twelvehours' work.]  They carry mats of sugar on their heads (70 pounds) allday lading ships, for half a rupee, and work at gardening all day forless.
The camaron is a fresh water creature like a cray-fish.  It is regardedhere as the world's chiefest delicacy--and certainly it is good.  Guardspatrol the streams to prevent poaching it.  A fine of Rs.200 or 300(they say) for poaching.  Bait is thrown in the water; the camaron goesfor it; the fisher drops his loop in and works it around and about thecamaron he has selected, till he gets it over its tail; then there's ajerk or something to certify the camaron that it is his turn now; hesuddenly backs away, which moves the loop still further up his person anddraws it taut, and his days are ended.
Another dish, called palmiste, is like raw turnip-shavings and tasteslike green almonds; is very delicate and good.  Costs the life of a palmtree 12 to 20 years old--for it is the pith.
Another dish--looks like greens or a tangle of fine seaweed--is apreparation of the deadly nightshade.  Good enough.
The monkeys live in the dense forests on the flanks of the toy mountains,and they flock down nights and raid the sugar-fields.  Also on otherestates they come down and destroy a sort of bean-crop--just for fun,apparently--tear off the pods and throw them down.
The cyclone of 1892 tore down two great blocks of stone buildings in thecenter of Port Louis--the chief architectural feature-and left theuncomely and apparently frail blocks standing.  Everywhere in its trackit annihilated houses, tore off roofs, destroyed trees and crops.  Themen were in the towns, the women and children at home in the countrygetting crippled, killed, frightened to insanity; and the rain delugingthem, the wind howling, the thunder crashing, the lightning glaring.This for an hour or so.  Then a lull and sunshine; many ventured out ofsafe shelter; then suddenly here it came again from the opposite pointand renewed and completed the devastation.  It is said the Chinese fedthe sufferers for days on free rice.
Whole streets in Port Louis were laid flat--wrecked.  During a minute anda half the wind blew 123 miles an hour; no official record made afterthat, when it may have reached 150.  It cut down an obelisk.  It carriedan American ship into the woods after breaking the chains of two anchors.They now use four-two forward, two astern.  Common report says it killed1,200 in Port Louis alone, in half an hour.  Then came the lull of thecentral calm--people did not know the barometer was still going down--then suddenly all perdition broke loose again while people were rushingaround seeking friends and rescuing the wounded.  The noise wascomparable to nothing; there is nothing resembling it but thunder andcannon, and these are feeble in comparison.
What there is of Mauritius is beautiful.  You have undulating wideexpanses of sugar-cane--a fine, fresh green and very pleasant to the eye;and everywhere else you have a ragged luxuriance of tropic vegetation ofvivid greens of varying shades, a wild tangle of underbrush, withgraceful tall palms lifting their crippled plumes high above it; and youhave stretches of shady dense forest with limpid streams frolickingthrough them, continually glimpsed and lost and glimpsed again in thepleasantest hide-and-seek fashion; and you have some tiny mountains,some quaint and picturesque groups of toy peaks, and a dainty littlevest-pocket Matterhorn; and here and there and now and then a strip ofsea with a white ruffle of surf breaks into the view.
That is Mauritius; and pretty enough.  The details are few, the massedresult is charming, but not imposing; not riotous, not exciting; it is aSunday landscape.  Perspective, and the enchantments wrought by distance,are wanting.  There are no distances; there is no perspective, so tospeak.  Fifteen miles as the crow flies is the usual limit of vision.Mauritius is a garden and a park combined.  It affects one's emotions asparks and gardens affect them.  The surfaces of one's spiritual deeps arepleasantly played upon, the deeps themselves are not reached, notstirred.  Spaciousness, remote altitudes, the sense of mystery whichhaunts apparently inaccessible mountain domes and summits reposing in thesky--these are the things which exalt the spirit and move it to seevisions and dream dreams.
The Sandwich Islands remain my ideal of the perfect thing in the matterof tropical islands.  I would add another story to Mauna Loa's 16,000feet if I could, and make it particularly bold and steep and craggy andforbidding and snowy; and I would make the volcano spout its lava-floodsout of its summit instead of its sides; but aside from thesenon-essentials I have no corrections to suggest.  I hope these will beattended to; I do not wish to have to speak of it again.
