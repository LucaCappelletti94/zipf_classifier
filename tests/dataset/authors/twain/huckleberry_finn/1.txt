Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tomand me found the money that the robbers hid in thecave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollarsapiece -- all gold. It was an awful sight of moneywhen it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he tookit and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollara day apiece all the year round -- more than a bodycould tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas shetook me for her son, and allowed she would sivilizeme; but it was rough living in the house all the time,considering how dismal regular and decent the widowwas in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand itno longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and mysugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. ButTom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was goingto start a band of robbers, and I might join if I wouldgo back to the widow and be respectable. So I wentback.
The widow she cried over me, and called me a poorlost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names,too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put mein them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothingbut sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well,then, the old thing commenced again. The widowrung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time.When you got to the table you couldn't go right toeating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuckdown her head and grumble a little over the victuals,though there warn't really anything the matter withthem, -- that is, nothing only everything was cookedby itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different;things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swapsaround, and the things go better.
After supper she got out her book and learned meabout Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweatto find out all about him; but by and by she let it outthat Moses had been dead a considerable long time; sothen I didn't care no more about him, because I don'ttake no stock in dead people.
Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widowto let me. But she wouldn't. She said it was a meanpractice and wasn't clean, and I must try to not do itany more. That is just the way with some people.They get down on a thing when they don't knownothing about it. Here she was a-bothering aboutMoses, which was no kin to her, and no use to any-body, being gone, you see, yet finding a power offault with me for doing a thing that had some good init. And she took snuff, too; of course that was allright, because she done it herself.
Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid,with goggles on, had just come to live with her, andtook a set at me now with a spelling-book. Sheworked me middling hard for about an hour, and thenthe widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood itmuch longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull,and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, "Don'tput your feet up there, Huckleberry;" and "Don'tscrunch up like that, Huckleberry -- set up straight;"and pretty soon she would say, "Don't gap and stretchlike that, Huckleberry -- why don't you try to be-have?" Then she told me all about the bad place,and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then,but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was to gosomewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn'tparticular. She said it was wicked to say what I said;said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she wasgoing to live so as to go to the good place. Well, Icouldn't see no advantage in going where she wasgoing, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.But I never said so, because it would only maketrouble, and wouldn't do no good.
Now she had got a start, and she went on and toldme all about the good place. She said all a bodywould have to do there was to go around all day longwith a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn'tthink much of it. But I never said so. I asked her ifshe reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and shesaid not by a considerable sight. I was glad aboutthat, because I wanted him and me to be together.
Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it gottiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched theniggers in and had prayers, and then everybody wasoff to bed. I went up to my room with a piece ofcandle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in achair by the window and tried to think of somethingcheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so lonesome Imost wished I was dead. The stars were shining, andthe leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; andI heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about some-body that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog cry-ing about somebody that was going to die; and thewind was trying to whisper something to me, and Icouldn't make out what it was, and so it made the coldshivers run over me. Then away out in the woods Iheard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when itwants to tell about something that's on its mind andcan't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy inits grave, and has to go about that way every nightgrieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wishI had some company. Pretty soon a spider wentcrawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it litin the candle; and before I could budge it was allshriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me thatthat was an awful bad sign and would fetch me somebad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothesoff of me. I got up and turned around in my tracksthree times and crossed my breast every time; andthen I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread tokeep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence.You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you'vefound, instead of nailing it up over the door, but Ihadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keepoff bad luck when you'd killed a spider.
I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out mypipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still asdeath now, and so the widow wouldn't know. Well,after a long time I heard the clock away off in thetown go boom -- boom -- boom -- twelve licks; andall still again -- stiller than ever. Pretty soon I hearda twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees --something was a stirring. I set still and listened.Directly I could just barely hear a "me-yow! me-yow!" down there. That was good! Says I, "me-yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then I putout the light and scrambled out of the window on tothe shed. Then I slipped down to the ground andcrawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, therewas Tom Sawyer waiting for me.
