"Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see peoplein trouble, and I can't -- most always. Tell meabout it."
So she done it. And it was the niggers -- I justexpected it. She said the beautiful trip to Englandwas most about spoiled for her; she didn't know HOWshe was ever going to be happy there, knowing themother and the children warn't ever going to seeeach other no more -- and then busted out bittererthan ever, and flung up her hands, and says:
"Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't EVER going tosee each other any more!"
"But they WILL -- and inside of two weeks -- and IKNOW it!" says I.
Laws, it was out before I could think! And beforeI could budge she throws her arms around my neckand told me to say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN!
I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much,and was in a close place. I asked her to let me thinka minute; and she set there, very impatient and ex-cited and handsome, but looking kind of happy andeased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, Ireckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he isin a tight place is taking considerable many resks,though I ain't had no experience, and can't say forcertain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here'sa case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like thetruth is better and actuly SAFER than a lie. I must layit by in my mind, and think it over some time orother, it's so kind of strange and unregular. I neversee nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last,I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth thistime, though it does seem most like setting down on akag of powder and touching it off just to see whereyou'll go to. Then I says:
"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town alittle ways where you could go and stay three or fourdays?"
"Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?"
"Never mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I knowthe niggers will see each other again inside of twoweeks -- here in this house -- and PROVE how I knowit -- will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?"
"Four days!" she says; "I'll stay a year!"
"All right," I says, "I don't want nothing moreout of YOU than just your word -- I druther have it thananother man's kiss-the-Bible." She smiled and red-dened up very sweet, and I says, "If you don't mindit, I'll shut the door -- and bolt it."
Then I come back and set down again, and says:
"Don't you holler. Just set still and take it like aman. I got to tell the truth, and you want to braceup, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind, and going tobe hard to take, but there ain't no help for it. Theseuncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a coupleof frauds -- regular dead-beats. There, now we'reover the worst of it, you can stand the rest middlingeasy."
It jolted her up like everything, of course; but Iwas over the shoal water now, so I went right along,her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, andtold her every blame thing, from where we first struckthat young fool going up to the steamboat, clearthrough to where she flung herself on to the king'sbreast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen orseventeen times -- and then up she jumps, with herface afire like sunset, and says:
"The brute! Come, don't waste a minute -- not aSECOND -- we'll have them tarred and feathered, andflung in the river!"
Says I:
"Cert'nly. But do you mean BEFORE you go to Mr.Lothrop's, or --"
"Oh," she says, "what am I THINKING about!"she says, and set right down again. "Don't mindwhat I said -- please don't -- you WON'T, now, WILLyou?" Laying her silky hand on mine in that kindof a way that I said I would die first. "I neverthought, I was so stirred up," she says; "now go on,and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to do,and whatever you say I'll do it."
"Well," I says, "it's a rough gang, them twofrauds, and I'm fixed so I got to travel with them awhile longer, whether I want to or not -- I druther nottell you why; and if you was to blow on them thistown would get me out of their claws, and I'd be allright; but there'd be another person that you don'tknow about who'd be in big trouble. Well, we gotto save HIM, hain't we? Of course. Well, then, wewon't blow on them."
Saying them words put a good idea in my head. Isee how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of thefrauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But Ididn't want to run the raft in the daytime without any-body aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn'twant the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night.I says:
"Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, andyou won't have to stay at Mr. Lothrop's so long,nuther. How fur is it?"
"A little short of four miles -- right out in thecountry, back here."
"Well, that 'll answer. Now you go along out there,and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then getthem to fetch you home again -- tell them you'vethought of something. If you get here before elevenput a candle in this window, and if I don't turn upwait TILL eleven, and THEN if I don't turn up it meansI'm gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then youcome out and spread the news around, and get thesebeats jailed."
"Good," she says, "I'll do it."
"And if it just happens so that I don't get away,but get took up along with them, you must up and sayI told you the whole thing beforehand, and you muststand by me all you can."
"Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't toucha hair of your head!" she says, and I see her nostrilsspread and her eyes snap when she said it, too.
"If I get away I sha'n't be here," I says, "toprove these rapscallions ain't your uncles, and Icouldn't do it if I WAS here. I could swear they wasbeats and bummers, that's all, though that's worthsomething. Well, there's others can do that better thanwhat I can, and they're people that ain't going to bedoubted as quick as I'd be. I'll tell you how to findthem. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There-- 'Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.' Put it away, anddon't lose it. When the court wants to find out some-thing about these two, let them send up to Bricksvilleand say they've got the men that played the RoyalNonesuch, and ask for some witnesses -- why, you'llhave that entire town down here before you can hardlywink, Miss Mary. And they'll come a-biling, too."
I judged we had got everything fixed about rightnow. So I says:
"Just let the auction go right along, and don'tworry. Nobody don't have to pay for the things theybuy till a whole day after the auction on accounts ofthe short notice, and they ain't going out of this tillthey get that money; and the way we've fixed it thesale ain't going to count, and they ain't going to getno money. It's just like the way it was with theniggers -- it warn't no sale, and the niggers will beback before long. Why, they can't collect the moneyfor the NIGGERS yet -- they're in the worst kind of afix, Miss Mary."
"Well," she says, "I'll run down to breakfast now,and then I'll start straight for Mr. Lothrop's."
"'Deed, THAT ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane," Isays, "by no manner of means; go BEFORE breakfast."
"Why?"
"What did you reckon I wanted you to go at allfor, Miss Mary?"
"Well, I never thought -- and come to think, Idon't know. What was it?"
"Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't want no better book than whatyour face is. A body can set down and read it offlike coarse print. Do you reckon you can go andface your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never --"
"There, there, don't! Yes, I'll go before break-fast -- I'll be glad to. And leave my sisters withthem?"
"Yes; never mind about them. They've got tostand it yet a while. They might suspicion somethingif all of you was to go. I don't want you to see them,nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neigh-bor was to ask how is your uncles this morning yourface would tell something. No, you go right along,Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of them. I'lltell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles andsay you've went away for a few hours for to get alittle rest and change, or to see a friend, and you'll beback to-night or early in the morning."
"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't havemy love given to them."
"Well, then, it sha'n't be." It was well enough totell HER so -- no harm in it. It was only a little thingto do, and no trouble; and it's the little things thatsmooths people's roads the most, down here below; itwould make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn'tcost nothing. Then I says: "There's one more thing-- that bag of money."
"Well, they've got that; and it makes me feelpretty silly to think HOW they got it."
"No, you're out, there. They hain't got it."
"Why, who's got it?"
"I wish I knowed, but I don't. I HAD it, because Istole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; andI know where I hid it, but I'm afraid it ain't there nomore. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm just assorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I didhonest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had toshove it into the first place I come to, and run -- andit warn't a good place."
"Oh, stop blaming yourself -- it's too bad to do it,and I won't allow it -- you couldn't help it; it wasn'tyour fault. Where did you hide it?"
I didn't want to set her to thinking about hertroubles again; and I couldn't seem to get my mouthto tell her what would make her see that corpse layingin the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.So for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:
"I'd ruther not TELL you where I put it, Miss MaryJane, if you don't mind letting me off; but I'll write itfor you on a piece of paper, and you can read it alongthe road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to. Do youreckon that 'll do?"
"Oh, yes."
So I wrote: "I put it in the coffin. It was inthere when you was crying there, away in the night.I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry foryou, Miss Mary Jane."
It made my eyes water a little to remember her cry-ing there all by herself in the night, and them devilslaying there right under her own roof, shaming herand robbing her; and when I folded it up and give itto her I see the water come into her eyes, too; andshe shook me by the hand, hard, and says:
"GOOD-bye. I'm going to do everything just asyou've told me; and if I don't ever see you again, Isha'n't ever forget you. and I'll think of you a manyand a many a time, and I'll PRAY for you, too!" -- andshe was gone.
Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she'dtake a job that was more nearer her size. But I betshe done it, just the same -- she was just that kind.She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took thenotion -- there warn't no back-down to her, I judge.You may say what you want to, but in my opinionshe had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; inmy opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds likeflattery, but it ain't no flattery. And when it comesto beauty -- and goodness, too -- she lays over themall. I hain't ever seen her since that time that I seeher go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen hersince, but I reckon I've thought of her a many and amany a million times, and of her saying she wouldpray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would doany good for me to pray for HER, blamed if I wouldn'ta done it or bust.
Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon;because nobody see her go. When I struck Susanand the hare-lip, I says:
"What's the name of them people over on t'otherside of the river that you all goes to see sometimes?"
They says:
"There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."
"That's the name," I says; "I most forgot it.Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she'sgone over there in a dreadful hurry -- one of them'ssick."
"Which one?"
"I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but Ithinks it's --"
"Sakes alive, I hope it ain't HANNER?"
"I'm sorry to say it," I says, "but Hanner's thevery one."
"My goodness, and she so well only last week! Isshe took bad?"
"It ain't no name for it. They set up with her allnight, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don't think she'lllast many hours."
"Only think of that, now! What's the matter withher?"
I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right offthat way, so I says:
"Mumps."
"Mumps your granny! They don't set up withpeople that's got the mumps."
"They don't, don't they? You better bet they dowith THESE mumps. These mumps is different. It's anew kind, Miss Mary Jane said."
"How's it a new kind?"
"Because it's mixed up with other things."
"What other things?"
"Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas,and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever,and I don't know what all."
"My land! And they call it the MUMPS?"
"That's what Miss Mary Jane said."
"Well, what in the nation do they call it the MUMPSfor?"
"Why, because it IS the mumps. That's what itstarts with."
"Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. A body mightstump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well,and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and some-body come along and ask what killed him, and somenumskull up and say, 'Why, he stumped his TOE.'Would ther' be any sense in that? NO. And ther'ain't no sense in THIS, nuther. Is it ketching?"
"Is it KETCHING? Why, how you talk. Is a HARROWcatching -- in the dark? If you don't hitch on to onetooth, you're bound to on another, ain't you? Andyou can't get away with that tooth without fetchingthe whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kindof mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say -- andit ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come toget it hitched on good."
"Well, it's awful, I think," says the hare-lip."I'll go to Uncle Harvey and --"
"Oh, yes," I says, "I WOULD. Of COURSE I would.I wouldn't lose no time."
"Well, why wouldn't you?"
"Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.Hain't your uncles obleegd to get along home to Eng-land as fast as they can? And do you reckon they'dbe mean enough to go off and leave you to go all thatjourney by yourselves? YOU know they'll wait foryou. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey's apreacher, ain't he? Very well, then; is a PREACHERgoing to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going todeceive a SHIP CLERK? -- so as to get them to let MissMary Jane go aboard? Now YOU know he ain't.What WILL he do, then? Why, he'll say, 'It's a greatpity, but my church matters has got to get along thebest way they can; for my niece has been exposed tothe dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's mybounden duty to set down here and wait the threemonths it takes to show on her if she's got it.' Butnever mind, if you think it's best to tell your uncleHarvey --"
"Shucks, and stay fooling around here when wecould all be having good times in England whilst wewas waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's got it ornot? Why, you talk like a muggins."
"Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some ofthe neighbors."
"Listen at that, now. You do beat all for naturalstupidness. Can't you SEE that THEY'D go and tell?Ther' ain't no way but just to not tell anybody at ALL."
"Well, maybe you're right -- yes, I judge you AREright."
"But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she'sgone out a while, anyway, so he won't be uneasyabout her?"
"Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.She says, 'Tell them to give Uncle Harvey andWilliam my love and a kiss, and say I've run over theriver to see Mr.' -- Mr. -- what IS the name of thatrich family your uncle Peter used to think so muchof? -- I mean the one that --"
"Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?"
"Of course; bother them kind of names, a bodycan't ever seem to remember them, half the time,somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over for toask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auctionand buy this house, because she allowed her unclePeter would ruther they had it than anybody else;and she's going to stick to them till they say they'llcome, and then, if she ain't too tired, she's cominghome; and if she is, she'll be home in the morninganyway. She said, don't say nothing about the Proc-tors, but only about the Apthorps -- which 'll be per-fectly true, because she is going there to speak abouttheir buying the house; I know it, because she toldme so herself."
"All right," they said, and cleared out to lay fortheir uncles, and give them the love and the kisses,and tell them the message.
Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn'tsay nothing because they wanted to go to England;and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane wasoff working for the auction than around in reach ofDoctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I haddone it pretty neat -- I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn'ta done it no neater himself. Of course he would athrowed more style into it, but I can't do that veryhandy, not being brung up to it.
Well, they held the auction in the public square,along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strungalong, and strung along, and the old man he was onhand and looking his level pisonest, up there longsideof the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripturenow and then, or a little goody-goody saying of somekind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sym-pathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himselfgenerly.
But by and by the thing dragged through, andeverything was sold -- everything but a little old triflinglot in the graveyard. So they'd got to work that off-- I never see such a girafft as the king was for want-ing to swallow EVERYTHING. Well, whilst they was at ita steamboat landed, and in about two minutes upcomes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughingand carrying on, and singing out:
"HERE'S your opposition line! here's your two setso' heirs to old Peter Wilks -- and you pays yourmoney and you takes your choice!"
