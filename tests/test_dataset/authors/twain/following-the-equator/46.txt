If the desire to kill and the opportunity to kill came always together,who would escape hanging. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

On the Train.  Fifty years ago, when I was a boy in the then remote andsparsely peopled Mississippi valley, vague tales and rumors of amysterious body of professional murderers came wandering in from acountry which was constructively as far from us as the constellationsblinking in space--India; vague tales and rumors of a sect called Thugs,who waylaid travelers in lonely places and killed them for thecontentment of a god whom they worshiped; tales which everybody liked tolisten to and nobody believed, except with reservations.  It wasconsidered that the stories had gathered bulk on their travels.  Thematter died down and a lull followed.  Then Eugene Sue's "Wandering Jew"appeared, and made great talk for a while.  One character in it was achief of Thugs--"Feringhea"--a mysterious and terrible Indian who was asslippery and sly as a serpent, and as deadly; and he stirred up the Thuginterest once more.  But it did not last.  It presently died again thistime to stay dead.
At first glance it seems strange that this should have happened; butreally it was not strange--on the contrary--it was natural; I mean onour side of the water.  For the source whence the Thug tales mainly camewas a Government Report, and without doubt was not republished inAmerica; it was probably never even seen there.  Government Reports haveno general circulation.  They are distributed to the few, and are notalways read by those few.  I heard of this Report for the first time aday or two ago, and borrowed it.  It is full of fascinations; and itturns those dim, dark fairy tales of my boyhood days into realities.
The Report was made in 1889 by Major Sleeman, of the Indian Service, andwas printed in Calcutta in 1840.  It is a clumsy, great, fat, poor sampleof the printer's art, but good enough for a government printing-office inthat old day and in that remote region, perhaps.  To Major Sleeman wasgiven the general superintendence of the giant task of ridding India ofThuggee, and he and his seventeen assistants accomplished it.  It was theAugean Stables over again.  Captain Vallancey, writing in a Madrasjournal in those old times, makes this remark:
     "The day that sees this far-spread evil eradicated from India and     known only in name, will greatly tend to immortalize British rule in     the East."
He did not overestimate the magnitude and difficulty of the work, nor theimmensity of the credit which would justly be due to British rule in caseit was accomplished.
Thuggee became known to the British authorities in India about 1810, butits wide prevalence was not suspected; it was not regarded as a seriousmatter, and no systematic measures were taken for its suppression untilabout 1830.  About that time Major Sleeman captured Eugene Sue'sThug-chief, "Feringhea," and got him to turn King's evidence.  Therevelations were so stupefying that Sleeman was not able to believe them.Sleeman thought he knew every criminal within his jurisdiction, and thatthe worst of them were merely thieves; but Feringhea told him that he wasin reality living in the midst of a swarm of professional murderers; thatthey had been all about him for many years, and that they buried theirdead close by.  These seemed insane tales; but Feringhea said come andsee--and he took him to a grave and dug up a hundred bodies, and told himall the circumstances of the killings, and named the Thugs who had donethe work.  It was a staggering business.  Sleeman captured some of theseThugs and proceeded to examine them separately, and with properprecautions against collusion; for he would not believe any Indian'sunsupported word.  The evidence gathered proved the truth of whatFeringhea had said, and also revealed the fact that gangs of Thugs wereplying their trade all over India.  The astonished government now tookhold of Thuggee, and for ten years made systematic and relentless warupon it, and finally destroyed it.  Gang after gang was captured, tried,and punished.  The Thugs were harried and hunted from one end of India tothe other.  The government got all their secrets out of them; and alsogot the names of the members of the bands, and recorded them in a book,together with their birthplaces and places of residence.
The Thugs were worshipers of Bhowanee; and to this god they sacrificedanybody that came handy; but they kept the dead man's things themselves,for the god cared for nothing but the corpse.  Men were initiated intothe sect with solemn ceremonies.  Then they were taught how to strangle aperson with the sacred choke-cloth, but were not allowed to performofficially with it until after long practice.  No half-educated stranglercould choke a man to death quickly enough to keep him from uttering asound--a muffled scream, gurgle, gasp, moan, or something of the sort;but the expert's work was instantaneous: the cloth was whipped around thevictim's neck, there was a sudden twist, and the head fell silentlyforward, the eyes starting from the sockets; and all was over.  The Thugcarefully guarded against resistance.  It was usual to to get the victimsto sit down, for that was the handiest position for business.
If the Thug had planned India itself it could not have been moreconveniently arranged for the needs of his occupation.
There were no public conveyances.  There were no conveyances for hire.The traveler went on foot or in a bullock cart or on a horse which hebought for the purpose.  As soon as he was out of his own little State orprincipality he was among strangers; nobody knew him, nobody took note ofhim, and from that time his movements could no longer be traced.  He didnot stop in towns or villages, but camped outside of them and sent hisservants in to buy provisions.  There were no habitations betweenvillages.  Whenever he was between villages he was an easy prey,particularly as he usually traveled by night, to avoid the heat.  He wasalways being overtaken by strangers who offered him the protection oftheir company, or asked for the protection of his--and these strangerswere often Thugs, as he presently found out to his cost.  Thelandholders, the native police, the petty princes, the village officials,the customs officers were in many cases protectors and harborers of theThugs, and betrayed travelers to them for a share of the spoil.  At firstthis condition of things made it next to impossible for the government tocatch the marauders; they were spirited away by these watchful friends.All through a vast continent, thus infested, helpless people of everycaste and kind moved along the paths and trails in couples and groupssilently by night, carrying the commerce of the country--treasure,jewels, money, and petty batches of silks, spices, and all manner ofwares.  It was a paradise for the Thug.
When the autumn opened, the Thugs began to gather together bypre-concert.  Other people had to have interpreters at every turn, butnot the Thugs; they could talk together, no matter how far apart theywere born, for they had a language of their own, and they had secretsigns by which they knew each other for Thugs; and they were alwaysfriends.  Even their diversities of religion and caste were sunk indevotion to their calling, and the Moslem and the high-caste andlow-caste Hindoo were staunch and affectionate brothers in Thuggery.
When a gang had been assembled, they had religious worship, and waitedfor an omen.  They had definite notions about the omens.  The cries ofcertain animals were good omens, the cries of certain other creatureswere bad omens.  A bad omen would stop proceedings and send the men home.
The sword and the strangling-cloth were sacred emblems.  The Thugsworshiped the sword at home before going out to the assembling-place; thestrangling-cloth was worshiped at the place of assembly.  The chiefs ofmost of the bands performed the religious ceremonies themselves; but theKaets delegated them to certain official stranglers (Chaurs).  The ritesof the Kaets were so holy that no one but the Chaur was allowed to touchthe vessels and other things used in them.
Thug methods exhibit a curious mixture of caution and the absence of it;cold business calculation and sudden, unreflecting impulse; but therewere two details which were constant, and not subject to caprice: patientpersistence in following up the prey, and pitilessness when the time cameto act.
Caution was exhibited in the strength of the bands.  They never feltcomfortable and confident unless their strength exceeded that of anyparty of travelers they were likely to meet by four or fivefold.  Yet itwas never their purpose to attack openly, but only when the victims wereoff their guard.  When they got hold of a party of travelers they oftenmoved along in their company several days, using all manner of arts towin their friendship and get their confidence.  At last, when this wasaccomplished to their satisfaction, the real business began.  A few Thugswere privately detached and sent forward in the dark to select a goodkilling-place and dig the graves.  When the rest reached the spot a haltwas called, for a rest or a smoke.  The travelers were invited to sit.By signs, the chief appointed certain Thugs to sit down in front of thetravelers as if to wait upon them, others to sit down beside them andengage them in conversation, and certain expert stranglers to standbehind the travelers and be ready when the signal was given.  The signalwas usually some commonplace remark, like "Bring the tobacco."  Sometimesa considerable wait ensued after all the actors were in their places--thechief was biding his time, in order to make everything sure.  Meantime,the talk droned on, dim figures moved about in the dull light, peace andtranquility reigned, the travelers resigned themselves to the pleasantreposefulness and comfort of the situation, unconscious of thedeath-angels standing motionless at their backs.  The time was ripe, now,and the signal came: "Bring the tobacco."  There was a mute swiftmovement, all in the same instant the men at each victim's sides seizedhis hands, the man in front seized his feet, and pulled, the man at hisback whipped the cloth around his neck and gave it a twist the head sunkforward, the tragedy was over.  The bodies were stripped and covered upin the graves, the spoil packed for transportation, then the Thugs gavepious thanks to Bhowanee, and departed on further holy service.
The Report shows that the travelers moved in exceedingly small groups--twos, threes, fours, as a rule; a party with a dozen in it was rare.  TheThugs themselves seem to have been the only people who moved in force.They went about in gangs of 10, 15, 25, 40, 60, 100, 150, 200, 250, andone gang of 310 is mentioned.  Considering their numbers, their catch wasnot extraordinary--particularly when you consider that they were not inthe least fastidious, but took anybody they could get, whether rich orpoor, and sometimes even killed children.  Now and then they killedwomen, but it was considered sinful to do it, and unlucky.  The "season"was six or eight months long.  One season the half dozen Bundelkand andGwalior gangs aggregated 712 men, and they murdered 210 people.  Oneseason the Malwa and Kandeish gangs aggregated 702 men, and they murdered232.  One season the Kandeish and Berar gangs aggregated 963 men, andthey murdered 385 people.
Here is the tally-sheet of a gang of sixty Thugs for a whole season--gangunder two noted chiefs, "Chotee and Sheik Nungoo from Gwalior":
     "Left Poora, in Jhansee, and on arrival at Sarora murdered a     traveler.
     "On nearly reaching Bhopal, met 3 Brahmins, and murdered them.
     "Cross the Nerbudda; at a village called Hutteea, murdered a Hindoo.
     "Went through Aurungabad to Walagow; there met a Havildar of the     barber caste and 5 sepoys (native soldiers); in the evening came to     Jokur, and in the morning killed them near the place where the     treasure-bearers were killed the year before.
     "Between Jokur and Dholeea met a sepoy of the shepherd caste; killed     him in the jungle.
     "Passed through Dholeea and lodged in a village; two miles beyond,     on the road to Indore, met a Byragee (beggar-holy mendicant);     murdered him at the Thapa.
     "In the morning, beyond the Thapa, fell in with 3 Marwarie     travelers; murdered them.
     "Near a village on the banks of the Taptee met 4 travelers and     killed them.
     "Between Choupra and Dhoreea met a Marwarie; murdered him.
     "At Dhoreea met 3 Marwaries; took them two miles and murdered them.
     "Two miles further on, overtaken by three treasure-bearers; took     them two miles and murdered them in the jungle.
     "Came on to Khurgore Bateesa in Indore, divided spoil, and     dispersed.
     "A total of 27 men murdered on one expedition."
Chotee (to save his neck) was informer, and furnished these facts.Several things are noticeable about his resume.  1. Business brevity;2, absence of emotion; 3, smallness of the parties encountered by the 60;4, variety in character and quality of the game captured; 5, Hindoo andMohammedan chiefs in business together for Bhowanee; 6, the sacred casteof the Brahmins not respected by either; 7, nor yet the character of thatmendicant, that Byragee.
A beggar is a holy creature, and some of the gangs spared him on thataccount, no matter how slack business might be; but other gangsslaughtered not only him, but even that sacredest of sacred creatures,the fakeer--that repulsive skin-and-bone thing that goes around naked andmats his bushy hair with dust and dirt, and so beflours his lean bodywith ashes that he looks like a specter.  Sometimes a fakeer trusted ashade too far in the protection of his sacredness.  In the middle of atally-sheet of Feringhea's, who had been out with forty Thugs, I find acase of the kind.  After the killing of thirty-nine men and one woman,the fakeer appears on the scene:
     "Approaching Doregow, met 3 pundits; also a fakeer, mounted on a     pony; he was plastered over with sugar to collect flies, and was     covered with them.  Drove off the fakeer, and killed the other     three.
     "Leaving Doregow, the fakeer joined again, and went on in company to     Raojana; met 6 Khutries on their way from Bombay to Nagpore.  Drove     off the fakeer with stones, and killed the 6 men in camp, and buried     them in the grove.
     "Next day the fakeer joined again; made him leave at Mana.  Beyond     there, fell in with two Kahars and a sepoy, and came on towards the     place selected for the murder.  When near it, the fakeer came again.     Losing all patience with him, gave Mithoo, one of the gang, 5 rupees     ($2.50) to murder him, and take the sin upon himself.  All four were     strangled, including the fakeer.  Surprised to find among the     fakeer's effects 30 pounds of coral, 350 strings of small pearls, 15     strings of large pearls, and a gilt necklace."
It it curious, the little effect that time has upon a really interestingcircumstance.  This one, so old, so long ago gone down into oblivion,reads with the same freshness and charm that attach to the news in themorning paper; one's spirits go up, then down, then up again, followingthe chances which the fakeer is running; now you hope, now you despair,now you hope again; and at last everything comes out right, and you feela great wave of personal satisfaction go weltering through you, andwithout thinking, you put out your hand to pat Mithoo on the back, when--puff! the whole thing has vanished away, there is nothing there; Mithooand all the crowd have been dust and ashes and forgotten, oh, so many,many, many lagging years!  And then comes a sense of injury: you don'tknow whether Mithoo got the swag, along with the sin, or had to divide upthe swag and keep all the sin himself.  There is no literary art about agovernment report.  It stops a story right in the most interesting place.
These reports of Thug expeditions run along interminably in onemonotonous tune: "Met a sepoy--killed him; met 5 pundits--killed them;met 4 Rajpoots and a woman--killed them"--and so on, till the statisticsget to be pretty dry.  But this small trip of Feringhea's Forty had somelittle variety about it.  Once they came across a man hiding in a grave--a thief; he had stolen 1,100 rupees from Dhunroj Seith of Parowtee.They strangled him and took the money.  They had no patience with thieves.They killed two treasure-bearers, and got 4,000 rupees.  They came acrosstwo bullocks "laden with copper pice," and killed the four drivers andtook the money.  There must have been half a ton of it.  I think it takesa double handful of pice to make an anna, and 16 annas to make a rupee;and even in those days the rupee was worth only half a dollar.  Comingback over their tracks from Baroda, they had another picturesque strokeof luck:  "'The Lohars of Oodeypore' put a traveler in their charge forsafety."  Dear, dear, across this abyssmal gulf of time we still seeFeringhea's lips uncover his teeth, and through the dim haze we catch theincandescent glimmer of his smile.  He accepted that trust, good man; andso we know what went with the traveler.
Even Rajahs had no terrors for Feringhea; he came across anelephant-driver belonging to the Rajah of Oodeypore and promptlystrangled him.
"A total of 100 men and 5 women murdered on this expedition."
Among the reports of expeditions we find mention of victims of almostevery quality and estate.
Also a prince's cook; and even the water-carrier of that sublime lord oflords and king of kings, the Governor-General of India!  How broad theywere in their tastes!  They also murdered actors--poor wanderingbarnstormers.  There are two instances recorded; the first one by a gangof Thugs under a chief who soils a great name borne by a better man--Kipling's deathless "Gungadin":
     "After murdering 4 sepoys, going on toward Indore, met 4 strolling     players, and persuaded them to come with us, on the pretense that we     would see their performance at the next stage.  Murdered them at a     temple near Bhopal."
Second instance:
     "At Deohuttee, joined by comedians.  Murdered them eastward of that     place."
But this gang was a particularly bad crew.  On that expedition theymurdered a fakeer and twelve beggars.  And yet Bhowanee protected them;for once when they were strangling a man in a wood when a crowd was goingby close at hand and the noose slipped and the man screamed, Bhowaneemade a camel burst out at the same moment with a roar that drowned thescream; and before the man could repeat it the breath was choked out ofhis body.
The cow is so sacred in India that to kill her keeper is an awfulsacrilege, and even the Thugs recognized this; yet now and then the lustfor blood was too strong, and so they did kill a few cow-keepers.  In oneof these instances the witness who killed the cowherd said, "In Thuggeethis is strictly forbidden, and is an act from which no good can come.  Iwas ill of a fever for ten days afterward.  I do believe that evil willfollow the murder of a man with a cow.  If there be no cow it does notsignify."  Another Thug said he held the cowherd's feet while thiswitness did the strangling.  He felt no concern, "because the bad fortuneof such a deed is upon the strangler and not upon the assistants; even ifthere should be a hundred of them."
There were thousands of Thugs roving over India constantly, during manygenerations.  They made Thug gee a hereditary vocation and taught it totheir sons and to their son's sons.  Boys were in full membership asearly as 16 years of age; veterans were still at work at 70.  What wasthe fascination, what was the impulse?  Apparently, it was partly piety,largely gain, and there is reason to suspect that the sport afforded wasthe chiefest fascination of all.  Meadows Taylor makes a Thug in one ofhis books claim that the pleasure of killing men was the white man'sbeast-hunting instinct enlarged, refined, ennobled.  I will quote thepassage:
