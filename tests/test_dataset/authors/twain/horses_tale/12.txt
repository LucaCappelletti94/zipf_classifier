"Sage-Brush, you have been listening?"
"Yes."
"Isn't it strange?"
"Well, no, Mongrel, I don't know that it is."
"Why don't you?"
"I've seen a good many human beings in my time.  They are createdas they are; they cannot help it.  They are only brutal becausethat is their make; brutes would be brutal if it was THEIR make."
"To me, Sage-Brush, man is most strange and unaccountable.  Whyshould he treat dumb animals that way when they are not doing anyharm?"
"Man is not always like that, Mongrel; he is kind enough when he isnot excited by religion."
"Is the bull-fight a religious service?"
"I think so.  I have heard so.  It is held on Sunday."
(A REFLECTIVE PAUSE, LASTING SOME MOMENTS.)  Then:
"When we die, Sage-Brush, do we go to heaven and dwell with man?"
"My father thought not.  He believed we do not have to go thereunless we deserve it."
