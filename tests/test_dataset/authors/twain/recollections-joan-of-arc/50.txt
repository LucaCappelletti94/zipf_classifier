BOOK III TRIAL AND MARTYRDOM
1 The Maid in Chains
I CANNOT bear to dwell at great length upon the shameful history of thesummer and winter following the capture. For a while I was not muchtroubled, for I was expecting every day to hear that Joan had been put toransom, and that the King--no, not the King, but grateful France--hadcome eagerly forward to pay it. By the laws of war she could not bedenied the privilege of ransom. She was not a rebel; she was alegitimately constituted soldier, head of the armies of France by herKing's appointment, and guilty of no crime known to military law;therefore she could not be detained upon any pretext, if ransom wereproffered.
But day after day dragged by and no ransom was offered! It seemsincredible, but it is true. Was that reptile Tremouille busy at theKing's ear? All we know is, that the King was silent, and made no offerand no effort in behalf of this poor girl who had done so much for him.
But, unhappily, there was alacrity enough in another quarter. The news ofthe capture reached Paris the day after it happened, and the glad Englishand Burgundians deafened the world all the day and all the night with theclamor of their joy-bells and the thankful thunder of their artillery,and the next day the Vicar-General of the Inquisition sent a message tothe Duke of Burgundy requiring the delivery of the prisoner into thehands of the Church to be tried as an idolater.
The English had seen their opportunity, and it was the English power thatwas really acting, not the Church. The Church was being used as a blind,a disguise; and for a forcible reason: the Church was not only able totake the life of Joan of Arc, but to blight her influence and thevalor-breeding inspiration of her name, whereas the English power couldbut kill her body; that would not diminish or destroy the influence ofher name; it would magnify it and make it permanent. Joan of Arc was theonly power in France that the English did not despise, the only power inFrance that they considered formidable. If the Church could be brought totake her life, or to proclaim her an idolater, a heretic, a witch, sentfrom Satan, not from heaven, it was believed that the English supremacycould be at once reinstated.
The Duke of Burgundy listened--but waited. He could not doubt that theFrench King or the French people would come forward presently and pay ahigher price than the English. He kept Joan a close prisoner in a strongfortress, and continued to wait, week after week. He was a French prince,and was at heart ashamed to sell her to the English. Yet with all hiswaiting no offer came to him from the French side.
One day Joan played a cunning truck on her jailer, and not only slippedout of her prison, but locked him up in it. But as she fled away she wasseen by a sentinel, and was caught and brought back.
Then she was sent to Beaurevoir, a stronger castle. This was early inAugust, and she had been in captivity more than two months now. Here shewas shut up in the top of a tower which was sixty feet high. She ate herheart there for another long stretch--about three months and a half. Andshe was aware, all these weary five months of captivity, that theEnglish, under cover of the Church, were dickering for her as one woulddicker for a horse or a slave, and that France was silent, the Kingsilent, all her friends the same. Yes, it was pitiful.
And yet when she heard at last that Compiegne was being closely besiegedand likely to be captured, and that the enemy had declared that noinhabitant of it should escape massacre, not even children of seven yearsof age, she was in a fever at once to fly to our rescue. So she tore herbedclothes to strips and tied them together and descended this frail ropein the night, and it broke, and she fell and was badly bruised, andremained three days insensible, meantime neither eating nor drinking.
And now came relief to us, led by the Count of Vend"me, and Compiegne wassaved and the siege raised. This was a disaster to the Duke of Burgundy.He had to save money now. It was a good time for a new bid to be made forJoan of Arc. The English at once sent a French bishop--that foreverinfamous Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais. He was partly promised theArchbishopric of Rouen, which was vacant, if he should succeed. Heclaimed the right to preside over Joan's ecclesiastical trial because thebattle-ground where she was taken was within his diocese. By the militaryusage of the time the ransom of a royal prince was 10,000 livres of gold,which is 61,125 francs--a fixed sum, you see. It must be accepted whenoffered; it could not be refused.
Cauchon brought the offer of this very sum from the English--a royalprince's ransom for the poor little peasant-girl of Domremy. It shows ina striking way the English idea of her formidable importance. It wasaccepted. For that sum Joan of Arc, the Savior of France, was sold; soldto her enemies; to the enemies of her country; enemies who had lashed andthrashed and thumped and trounced France for a century and made holidaysport of it; enemies who had forgotten, years and years ago, what aFrenchman's face was like, so used were they to seeing nothing but hisback; enemies whom she had whipped, whom she had cowed, whom she hadtaught to respect French valor, new-born in her nation by the breath ofher spirit; enemies who hungered for her life as being the only puissanceable to stand between English triumph and French degradation. Sold to aFrench priest by a French prince, with the French King and the Frenchnation standing thankless by and saying nothing.
And she--what did she say? Nothing. Not a reproach passed her lips. Shewas too great for that--she was Joan of Arc; and when that is said, allis said.
As a soldier, her record was spotless. She could not be called to accountfor anything under that head. A subterfuge must be found, and, as we haveseen, was found. She must be tried by priests for crimes againstreligion. If none could be discovered, some must be invented. Let themiscreant Cauchon alone to contrive those.
Rouen was chosen as the scene of the trial. It was in the heart of theEnglish power; its population had been under English dominion so manygenerations that they were hardly French now, save in language. The placewas strongly garrisoned. Joan was taken there near the end of December,1430, and flung into a dungeon. Yes, and clothed in chains, that freespirit!
Still France made no move. How do I account for this? I think there isonly one way. You will remember that whenever Joan was not at the front,the French held back and ventured nothing; that whenever she led, theyswept everything before them, so long as they could see her white armoror her banner; that every time she fell wounded or was reportedkilled--as at Compiegne--they broke in panic and fled like sheep. I arguefrom this that they had undergone no real transformation as yet; that atbottom they were still under the spell of a timorousness born ofgenerations of unsuccess, and a lack of confidence in each other and intheir leaders born of old and bitter experience in the way of treacheriesof all sorts--for their kings had been treacherous to their great vassalsand to their generals, and these in turn were treacherous to the head ofthe state and to each other. The soldiery found that they could dependutterly on Joan, and upon her alone. With her gone, everything was gone.She was the sun that melted the frozen torrents and set them boiling;with that sun removed, they froze again, and the army and all Francebecame what they had been before, mere dead corpses--that and nothingmore; incapable of thought, hope, ambition, or motion.
