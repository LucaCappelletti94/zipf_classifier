Marion City, on the Mississippi River, in the State ofMissouri--a village; time, 1845. La Bourboule-les-Bains, France--a village; time, the end of June, 1894. I was in the onevillage in that early time; I am in the other now. These timesand places are sufficiently wide apart, yet today I have thestrange sense of being thrust back into that Missourian villageand of reliving certain stirring days that I lived there so longago.Last Saturday night the life of the President of the FrenchRepublic was taken by an Italian assassin. Last night a mobsurrounded our hotel, shouting, howling, singing the"Marseillaise," and pelting our windows with sticks and stones;for we have Italian waiters, and the mob demanded that they beturned out of the house instantly--to be drubbed, and then drivenout of the village. Everybody in the hotel remained up until farinto the night, and experienced the several kinds of terror whichone reads about in books which tell of nigh attacks by Italiansand by French mobs: the growing roar of the oncoming crowd; thearrival, with rain of stones and a crash of glass; the withdrawalto rearrange plans--followed by a silence ominous, threatening,and harder to bear than even the active siege and the noise. Thelandlord and the two village policemen stood their ground, and atlast the mob was persuaded to go away and leave our Italians inpeace. Today four of the ringleaders have been sentenced toheavy punishment of a public sort--and are become local heroes,by consequence.That is the very mistake which was at first made in theMissourian village half a century ago. The mistake was repeatedand repeated--just as France is doing in these later months.In our village we had our Ravochals, our Henrys, ourVaillants; and in a humble way our Cesario--I hope I have spelledthis name wrong. Fifty years ago we passed through, in allessentials, what France has been passing through during the pasttwo or three years, in the matter of periodical frights, horrors,and shudderings.In several details the parallels are quaintly exact. Inthat day, for a man to speak out openly and proclaim himself anenemy of negro slavery was simply to proclaim himself a madman.For he was blaspheming against the holiest thing known to aMissourian, and could NOT be in his right mind. For a man toproclaim himself an anarchist in France, three years ago, was toproclaim himself a madman--he could not be in his right mind.Now the original first blasphemer against any institutionprofoundly venerated by a community is quite sure to be inearnest; his followers and imitators may be humbugs and self-seekers, but he himself is sincere--his heart is in his protest.Robert Hardy was our first ABOLITIONIST--awful name! He wasa journeyman cooper, and worked in the big cooper-shop belongingto the great pork-packing establishment which was Marion City'schief pride and sole source of prosperity. He was a New-Englander, a stranger. And, being a stranger, he was of courseregarded as an inferior person--for that has been human naturefrom Adam down--and of course, also, he was made to feelunwelcome, for this is the ancient law with man and the otheranimals. Hardy was thirty years old, and a bachelor; pale, givento reverie and reading. He was reserved, and seemed to preferthe isolation which had fallen to his lot. He was treated tomany side remarks by his fellows, but as he did not resent themit was decided that he was a coward.All of a sudden he proclaimed himself an abolitionist--straight out and publicly! He said that negro slavery was acrime, an infamy. For a moment the town was paralyzed withastonishment; then it broke into a fury of rage and swarmedtoward the cooper-shop to lynch Hardy. But the Methodistminister made a powerful speech to them and stayed their hands.He proved to them that Hardy was insane and not responsible forhis words; that no man COULD be sane and utter such words.So Hardy was saved. Being insane, he was allowed to go ontalking. He was found to be good entertainment. Several nightsrunning he made abolition speeches in the open air, and all thetown flocked to hear and laugh. He implored them to believe himsane and sincere, and have pity on the poor slaves, and takemeasurements for the restoration of their stolen rights, or in nolong time blood would flow--blood, blood, rivers of blood!It was great fun. But all of a sudden the aspect of thingschanged. A slave came flying from Palmyra, the county-seat, afew miles back, and was about to escape in a canoe to Illinoisand freedom in the dull twilight of the approaching dawn, whenthe town constable seized him. Hardy happened along and tried torescue the negro; there was a struggle, and the constable did notcome out of it alive. Hardly crossed the river with the negro,and then came back to give himself up. All this took time, forthe Mississippi is not a French brook, like the Seine, the Loire,and those other rivulets, but is a real river nearly a mile wide.The town was on hand in force by now, but the Methodist preacherand the sheriff had already made arrangements in the interest oforder; so Hardy was surrounded by a strong guard and safelyconveyed to the village calaboose in spite of all the effort ofthe mob to get hold of him. The reader will have begun toperceive that this Methodist minister was a prompt man; a promptman, with active hands and a good headpiece. Williams was hisname--Damon Williams; Damon Williams in public, Damnation Williamsin private, because he was so powerful on that theme and so frequent.The excitement was prodigious. The constable was the firstman who had ever been killed in the town. The event was by longodds the most imposing in the town's history. It lifted thehumble village into sudden importance; its name was ineverybody's mouth for twenty miles around. And so was the nameof Robert Hardy--Robert Hardy, the stranger, the despised. In aday he was become the person of most consequence in the region,the only person talked about. As to those other coopers, theyfound their position curiously changed--they were importantpeople, or unimportant, now, in proportion as to how large or howsmall had been their intercourse with the new celebrity. The twoor three who had really been on a sort of familiar footing withhim found themselves objects of admiring interest with the publicand of envy with their shopmates.The village weekly journal had lately gone into new hands.The new man was an enterprising fellow, and he made the most ofthe tragedy. He issued an extra. Then he put up posterspromising to devote his whole paper to matters connected with thegreat event--there would be a full and intensely interestingbiography of the murderer, and even a portrait of him. He was asgood as his word. He carved the portrait himself, on the back ofa wooden type--and a terror it was to look at. It made a greatcommotion, for this was the first time the village paper had evercontained a picture. The village was very proud. The output ofthe paper was ten times as great as it had ever been before, yetevery copy was sold.When the trial came on, people came from all the farmsaround, and from Hannibal, and Quincy, and even from Keokuk; andthe court-house could hold only a fraction of the crowd thatapplied for admission. The trial was published in the villagepaper, with fresh and still more trying pictures of the accused.Hardy was convicted, and hanged--a mistake. People camefrom miles around to see the hanging; they brought cakes andcider, also the women and children, and made a picnic of thematter. It was the largest crowd the village had ever seen. Therope that hanged Hardy was eagerly bought up, in inch samples,for everybody wanted a memento of the memorable event.Martyrdom gilded with notoriety has its fascinations.Within one week afterward four young lightweights in the villageproclaimed themselves abolitionists! In life Hardy had not beenable to make a convert; everybody laughed at him; but nobodycould laugh at his legacy. The four swaggered around with theirslouch-hats pulled down over their faces, and hinted darkly atawful possibilities. The people were troubled and afraid, andshowed it. And they were stunned, too; they could not understandit. "Abolitionist" had always been a term of shame and horror;yet here were four young men who were not only not ashamed tobear that name, but were grimly proud of it. Respectable youngmen they were, too--of good families, and brought up in thechurch. Ed Smith, the printer's apprentice, nineteen, had beenthe head Sunday-school boy, and had once recited three thousandBible verses without making a break. Dick Savage, twenty, thebaker's apprentice; Will Joyce, twenty-two, journeymanblacksmith; and Henry Taylor, twenty-four, tobacco-stemmer--werethe other three. They were all of a sentimental cast; they wereall romance-readers; they all wrote poetry, such as it was; theywere all vain and foolish; but they had never before beensuspected of having anything bad in them.They withdrew from society, and grew more and moremysterious and dreadful. They presently achieved the distinctionof being denounced by names from the pulpit--which made animmense stir! This was grandeur, this was fame. They wereenvied by all the other young fellows now. This was natural.Their company grew--grew alarmingly. They took a name. It was asecret name, and was divulged to no outsider; publicly they weresimply the abolitionists. They had pass-words, grips, and signs;they had secret meetings; their initiations were conducted withgloomy pomps and ceremonies, at midnight.They always spoke of Hardy as "the Martyr," and every littlewhile they moved through the principal street in procession--atmidnight, black-robed, masked, to the measured tap of the solemndrum--on pilgrimage to the Martyr's grave, where they wentthrough with some majestic fooleries and swore vengeance upon hismurderers. They gave previous notice of the pilgrimage by smallposters, and warned everybody to keep indoors and darken allhouses along the route, and leave the road empty. These warningswere obeyed, for there was a skull and crossbones at the top ofthe poster.When this kind of thing had been going on about eight weeks,a quite natural thing happened. A few men of character and gritwoke up out of the nightmare of fear which had been stupefyingtheir faculties, and began to discharge scorn and scoffings atthemselves and the community for enduring this child's-play; andat the same time they proposed to end it straightway. Everybodyfelt an uplift; life was breathed into their dead spirits; theircourage rose and they began to feel like men again. This was ona Saturday. All day the new feeling grew and strengthened; itgrew with a rush; it brought inspiration and cheer with it.Midnight saw a united community, full of zeal and pluck, and witha clearly defined and welcome piece of work in front of it. Thebest organizer and strongest and bitterest talker on that greatSaturday was the Presbyterian clergyman who had denounced theoriginal four from his pulpit--Rev. Hiram Fletcher--and hepromised to use his pulpit in the public interest again now. Onthe morrow he had revelations to make, he said--secrets of thedreadful society.But the revelations were never made. At half past two inthe morning the dead silence of the village was broken by acrashing explosion, and the town patrol saw the preacher's housespring in a wreck of whirling fragments into the sky. Thepreacher was killed, together with a negro woman, his only slaveand servant.The town was paralyzed again, and with reason. To struggleagainst a visible enemy is a thing worth while, and there is aplenty of men who stand always ready to undertake it; but tostruggle against an invisible one--an invisible one who sneaks inand does his awful work in the dark and leaves no trace--that isanother matter. That is a thing to make the bravest tremble andhold back.The cowed populace were afraid to go to the funeral. Theman who was to have had a packed church to hear him expose anddenounce the common enemy had but a handful to see him buried.The coroner's jury had brought in a verdict of "death by thevisitation of God," for no witness came forward; if any existedthey prudently kept out of the way. Nobody seemed sorry. Nobodywanted to see the terrible secret society provoked into thecommission of further outrages. Everybody wanted the tragedyhushed up, ignored, forgotten, if possible.And so there was a bitter surprise and an unwelcome one whenWill Joyce, the blacksmith's journeyman, came out and proclaimedhimself the assassin! Plainly he was not minded to be robbed ofhis glory. He made his proclamation, and stuck to it. Stuck toit, and insisted upon a trial. Here was an ominous thing; herewas a new and peculiarly formidable terror, for a motive wasrevealed here which society could not hope to deal withsuccessfully--VANITY, thirst for notoriety. If men were going tokill for notoriety's sake, and to win the glory of newspaperrenown, a big trial, and a showy execution, what possibleinvention of man could discourage or deter them? The town was ina sort of panic; it did not know what to do.However, the grand jury had to take hold of the matter--ithad no choice. It brought in a true bill, and presently the casewent to the county court. The trial was a fine sensation. Theprisoner was the principal witness for the prosecution. He gavea full account of the assassination; he furnished even theminutest particulars: how he deposited his keg of powder andlaid his train--from the house to such-and-such a spot; howGeorge Ronalds and Henry Hart came along just then, smoking, andhe borrowed Hart's cigar and fired the train with it, shouting,"Down with all slave-tyrants!" and how Hart and Ronalds made noeffort to capture him, but ran away, and had never come forwardto testify yet.But they had to testify now, and they did--and pitiful itwas to see how reluctant they were, and how scared. The crowdedhouse listened to Joyce's fearful tale with a profound andbreathless interest, and in a deep hush which was not broken tillhe broke it himself, in concluding, with a roaring repetition of his"Death to all slave-tyrants!"--which came so unexpectedly and sostartlingly that it made everyone present catch his breath and gasp.The trial was put in the paper, with biography and large portrait,with other slanderous and insane pictures, and the edition soldbeyond imagination.The execution of Joyce was a fine and picturesque thing. Itdrew a vast crowd. Good places in trees and seats on rail fencessold for half a dollar apiece; lemonade and gingerbread-standshad great prosperity. Joyce recited a furious and fantastic anddenunciatory speech on the scaffold which had imposing passagesof school-boy eloquence in it, and gave him a reputation on thespot as an orator, and his name, later, in the society's records,of the "Martyr Orator." He went to his death breathing slaughter andcharging his society to "avenge his murder." If he knew anything ofhuman nature he knew that to plenty of young fellows present in thatgreat crowd he was a grand hero--and enviably situated.He was hanged. It was a mistake. Within a month from hisdeath the society which he had honored had twenty new members,some of them earnest, determined men. They did not courtdistinction in the same way, but they celebrated his martyrdom.The crime which had been obscure and despised had become loftyand glorified.Such things were happening all over the country. Wild-brained martyrdom was succeeded by uprising and organization.Then, in natural order, followed riot, insurrection, and thewrack and restitutions of war. It was bound to come, and itwould naturally come in that way. It has been the manner ofreform since the beginning of the world.
