Tinsel Trappings of Nobility
IT WAS vexatious to see what a to-do the whole town, and next the wholecountry, made over the news. Joan of Arc ennobled by the King! Peoplewent dizzy with wonder and delight over it. You cannot imagine how shewas gaped at, stared at, envied. Why, one would have supposed that somegreat and fortunate thing had happened to her. But we did not think anygreat things of it. To our minds no mere human hand could add a glory toJoan of Arc. To us she was the sun soaring in the heavens, and her newnobility a candle atop of it; to us it was swallowed up and lost in herown light. And she was as indifferent to it and as unconscious of it asthe other sun would have been.
But it was different with her brothers. They were proud and happy intheir new dignity, which was quite natural. And Joan was glad it had beenconferred, when she saw how pleased they were. It was a clever thought inthe King to outflank her scruples by marching on them under shelter ofher love for her family and her kin.
Jean and Pierre sported their coats-of-arms right away; and their societywas courted by everybody, the nobles and commons alike. TheStandard-Bearer said, with some touch of bitterness, that he could seethat they just felt good to be alive, they were so soaked with thecomfort of their glory; and didn't like to sleep at all, because whenthey were asleep they didn't know they were noble, and so sleep was aclean loss of time. And then he said:
"They can't take precedence of me in military functions and stateceremonies, but when it comes to civil ones and society affairs I judgethey'll cuddle coolly in behind you and the knights, and Noel and I willhave to walk behind them--hey?"
"Yes," I said, "I think you are right."
"I was just afraid of it--just afraid of it," said the Standard-Bearer,with a sigh. "Afraid of it? I'm talking like a fool; of course I knew it.Yes, I was talking like a fool."
Noel Rainguesson said, musingly:
"Yes, I noticed something natural about the tone of it."
We others laughed.
"Oh, you did, did you? You think you are very clever, don't you? I'lltake and wring your neck for you one of these days, Noel Rainguesson."
The Sieur de Metz said:
"Paladin, your fears haven't reached the top notch. They are away belowthe grand possibilities. Didn't it occur to you that in civil and societyfunctions they will take precedence of all the rest of the personalstaff--every one of us?"
"Oh, come!"
"You'll find it's so. Look at their escutcheon. Its chiefest feature isthe lilies of France. It's royal, man, royal--do you understand the sizeof that? The lilies are there by authority of the King--do you understandthe size of that? Though not in detail and in entirety, they donevertheless substantially quarter the arms of France in their coat.Imagine it! consider it! measure the magnitude of it! We walk in front ofthose boys? Bless you, we've done that for the last time. In my opinionthere isn't a lay lord in this whole region that can walk in front ofthem, except the Duke d'Alencon, prince of the blood."
You could have knocked the Paladin down with a feather. He seemed toactually turn pale. He worked his lips a moment without getting anythingout; then it came:
"I didn't know that, nor the half of it; how could I? I've been an idiot.I see it now--I've been an idiot. I met them this morning, and sung outhello to them just as I would to anybody. I didn't mean to beill-mannered, but I didn't know the half of this that you've beentelling. I've been an ass. Yes, that is all there is to it--I've been anass."
Noel Rainguesson said, in a kind of weary way:
"Yes, that is likely enough; but I don't see why you should seemsurprised at it."
"You don't, don't you? Well, why don't you?"
"Because I don't see any novelty about it. With some people it is acondition which is present all the time. Now you take a condition whichis present all the time, and the results of that condition will beuniform; this uniformity of result will in time become monotonous;monotonousness, by the law of its being, is fatiguing. If you hadmanifested fatigue upon noticing that you had been an ass, that wouldhave been logical, that would have been rational; whereas it seems to methat to manifest surprise was to be again an ass, because the conditionof intellect that can enable a person to be surprised and stirred byinert monotonousness is a--"
"Now that is enough, Noel Rainguesson; stop where you are, before you getyourself into trouble. And don't bother me any more for some days or aweek an it please you, for I cannot abide your clack."
"Come, I like that! I didn't want to talk. I tried to get out of talking.If you didn't want to hear my clack, what did you keep intruding yourconversation on me for?"
"I? I never dreamed of such a thing."
"Well, you did it, anyway. And I have a right to feel hurt, and I do feelhurt, to have you treat me so. It seems to me that when a person goads,and crowds, and in a manner forces another person to talk, it is neithervery fair nor very good-mannered to call what he says clack."
"Oh, snuffle--do! and break your heart, you poor thing. Somebody fetchthis sick doll a sugar-rag. Look you, Sir Jean de Metz, do you feelabsolutely certain about that thing?"
"What thing?"
"Why, that Jean and Pierre are going to take precedence of all the laynoblesse hereabouts except the Duke d'Alencon?"
"I think there is not a doubt of it."
The Standard-Bearer was deep in thoughts and dreams a few moments, thenthe silk-and-velvet expanse of his vast breast rose and fell with a sigh,and he said:
"Dear, dear, what a lift it is! It just shows what luck can do. Well, Idon't care. I shouldn't care to be a painted accident--I shouldn't valueit. I am prouder to have climbed up to where I am just by sheer naturalmerit than I would be to ride the very sun in the zenith and have toreflect that I was nothing but a poor little accident, and got shot upthere out of somebody else's catapult. To me, merit is everything--infact, the only thing. All else is dross."
Just then the bugles blew the assembly, and that cut our talk short.
