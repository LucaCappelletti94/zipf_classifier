By trying we can easily learn to endure adversity. Another man's,I mean. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
You soon find your long-ago dreams of India rising in a sort of vague andluscious moonlight above the horizon-rim of your opaque consciousness,and softly lighting up a thousand forgotten details which were parts of avision that had once been vivid to you when you were a boy, and steepedyour spirit in tales of the East. The barbaric gorgeousnesses, forinstance; and the princely titles, the sumptuous titles, the soundingtitles,--how good they taste in the mouth! The Nizam of Hyderabad; theMaharajah of Travancore; the Nabob of Jubbelpore; the Begum of Bhopal;the Nawab of Mysore; the Rance of Gulnare; the Ahkoond of Swat's; the Raoof Rohilkund; the Gaikwar of Baroda. Indeed, it is a country that runsrichly to name. The great god Vishnu has 108--108 special ones--108peculiarly holy ones--names just for Sunday use only. I learned thewhole of Vishnu's 108 by heart once, but they wouldn't stay; I don'tremember any of them now but John W.
And the romances connected with, those princely native houses--to thisday they are always turning up, just as in the old, old times. They weresweating out a romance in an English court in Bombay a while before wewere there. In this case a native prince, 16 1/2 years old, who has beenenjoying his titles and dignities and estates unmolested for fourteenyears, is suddenly haled into court on the charge that he is rightfullyno prince at all, but a pauper peasant; that the real prince died whentwo and one-half years old; that the death was concealed, and a peasantchild smuggled into the royal cradle, and that this present incumbent wasthat smuggled substitute. This is the very material that so manyoriental tales have been made of.
The case of that great prince, the Gaikwar of Baroda, is a reversal ofthe theme. When that throne fell vacant, no heir could be found for sometime, but at last one was found in the person of a peasant child who wasmaking mud pies in a village street, and having an innocent good time.But his pedigree was straight; he was the true prince, and he has reignedever since, with none to dispute his right.
Lately there was another hunt for an heir to another princely house, andone was found who was circumstanced about as the Gaikwar had been. Hisfathers were traced back, in humble life, along a branch of the ancestraltree to the point where it joined the stem fourteen generations ago, andhis heirship was thereby squarely established. The tracing was done bymeans of the records of one of the great Hindoo shrines, where princes onpilgrimage record their names and the date of their visit. This is tokeep the prince's religious account straight, and his spiritual personsafe; but the record has the added value of keeping the pedigreeauthentic, too.
When I think of Bombay now, at this distance of time, I seem to have akaleidoscope at my eye; and I hear the clash of the glass bits as thesplendid figures change, and fall apart, and flash into new forms, figureafter figure, and with the birth of each new form I feel my skin crinkleand my nerve-web tingle with a new thrill of wonder and delight. Theseremembered pictures float past me in a sequence of contracts; followingthe same order always, and always whirling by and disappearing with theswiftness of a dream, leaving me with the sense that the actuality wasthe experience of an hour, at most, whereas it really covered days, Ithink.
The series begins with the hiring of a "bearer"--native man-servant--aperson who should be selected with some care, because as long as he is inyour employ he will be about as near to you as your clothes.
In India your day may be said to begin with the "bearer's" knock on thebedroom door, accompanied by a formula of, words--a formula which isintended to mean that the bath is ready. It doesn't really seem to meananything at all. But that is because you are not used to "bearer"English. You will presently understand.
Where he gets his English is his own secret. There is nothing like itelsewhere in the earth; or even in paradise, perhaps, but the other placeis probably full of it. You hire him as soon as you touch Indian soil;for no matter what your sex is, you cannot do without him. He ismessenger, valet, chambermaid, table-waiter, lady's maid, courier--he iseverything. He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt; he sleepson the stone floor outside your chamber door, and gets his meals you donot know where nor when; you only know that he is not fed on thepremises, either when you are in a hotel or when you are a guest in aprivate house. His wages are large--from an Indian point of view--and hefeeds and clothes himself out of them. We had three of him in two and ahalf months. The first one's rate was thirty rupees a month that is tosay, twenty-seven cents a day; the rate of the others, Rs. 40 (40 rupees)a month. A princely sum; for the native switchman on a railway and thenative servant in a private family get only Rs. 7 per month, and thefarm-hand only 4. The two former feed and clothe themselves and theirfamilies on their $1.90 per month; but I cannot believe that the farmhandhas to feed himself on his $1.08. I think the farm probably feeds him,and that the whole of his wages, except a trifle for the priest, go tothe support of his family. That is, to the feeding of his family; forthey live in a mud hut, hand-made, and, doubtless, rent-free, and theywear no clothes; at least, nothing more than a rag. And not much of arag at that, in the case of the males. However, these are handsome timesfor the farm-hand; he was not always the child of luxury that he is now.The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, in a recent officialutterance wherein he was rebuking a native deputation for complaining ofhard times, reminded them that they could easily remember when afarm-hand's wages were only half a rupee (former value) a month--thatis to say, less than a cent a day; nearly $2.90 a year. If such awage-earner had a good deal of a family--and they all have that, for Godis very good to these poor natives in some ways--he would save a profitof fifteen cents, clean and clear, out of his year's toil; I mean afrugal, thrifty person would, not one given to display and ostentation.And if he owed $13.50 and took good care of his health, he could pay itoff in ninety years. Then he could hold up his head, and look hiscreditors in the face again.
Think of these facts and what they mean. India does not consist ofcities. There are no cities in India--to speak of. Its stupendouspopulation consists of farm-laborers. India is one vast farm--one almostinterminable stretch of fields with mud fences between. . . Think of theabove facts; and consider what an incredible aggregate of poverty theyplace before you.
The first Bearer that applied, waited below and sent up hisrecommendations. That was the first morning in Bombay. We read themover; carefully, cautiously, thoughtfully. There was not a fault to findwith them--except one; they were all from Americans. Is that a slur?If it is, it is a deserved one. In my experience, an American'srecommendation of a servant is not usually valuable. We are toogood-natured a race; we hate to say the unpleasant thing; we shrink fromspeaking the unkind truth about a poor fellow whose bread depends uponour verdict; so we speak of his good points only, thus not scrupling totell a lie--a silent lie--for in not mentioning his bad ones we as goodas say he hasn't any. The only difference that I know of between asilent lie and a spoken one is, that the silent lie is a less respectableone than the other. And it can deceive, whereas the other can't--as arule. We not only tell the silent lie as to a servant's faults, but wesin in another way: we overpraise his merits; for when it comes towriting recommendations of servants we are a nation of gushers. And wehave not the Frenchman's excuse. In France you must give the departingservant a good recommendation; and you must conceal his faults; you haveno choice. If you mention his faults for the protection of the nextcandidate for his services, he can sue you for damages; and the courtwill award them, too; and, moreover, the judge will give you a sharpdressing-down from the bench for trying to destroy a poor man'scharacter, and rob him of his bread. I do not state this on my ownauthority, I got it from a French physician of fame and repute--a man whowas born in Paris, and had practiced there all his life. And he saidthat he spoke not merely from common knowledge, but from exasperatingpersonal experience.
As I was saying, the Bearer's recommendations were all from Americantourists; and St. Peter would have admitted him to the fields of theblest on them--I mean if he is as unfamiliar with our people and our waysas I suppose he is. According to these recommendations, Manuel X. wassupreme in all the arts connected with his complex trade; and thesemanifold arts were mentioned--and praised-in detail. His English wasspoken of in terms of warm admiration--admiration verging upon rapture.I took pleased note of that, and hoped that some of it might be true.
We had to have some one right away; so the family went down stairs andtook him a week on trial; then sent him up to me and departed on theiraffairs. I was shut up in my quarters with a bronchial cough, and gladto have something fresh to look at, something new to play with. Manuelfilled the bill; Manuel was very welcome. He was toward fifty years old,tall, slender, with a slight stoop--an artificial stoop, a deferentialstoop, a stoop rigidified by long habit--with face of European mould;short hair intensely black; gentle black eyes, timid black eyes, indeed;complexion very dark, nearly black in fact; face smooth-shaven. He wasbareheaded and barefooted, and was never otherwise while his week with uslasted; his clothing was European, cheap, flimsy, and showed much wear.
He stood before me and inclined his head (and body) in the patheticIndian way, touching his forehead with the finger--ends of his righthand, in salute. I said:
"Manuel, you are evidently Indian, but you seem to have a Spanish namewhen you put it all together. How is that?"
A perplexed look gathered in his face; it was plain that he had notunderstood--but he didn't let on. He spoke back placidly.
"Name, Manuel. Yes, master."
"I know; but how did you get the name?"
"Oh, yes, I suppose. Think happen so. Father same name, not mother."
I saw that I must simplify my language and spread my words apart, if Iwould be understood by this English scholar.
"Well--then--how--did--your--father--get--his name?"
"Oh, he,"--brightening a little--"he Christian--Portygee; live in Goa; Iborn Goa; mother not Portygee, mother native-high-caste Brahmin--CoolinBrahmin; highest caste; no other so high caste. I high-caste Brahmin,too. Christian, too, same like father; high-caste Christian Brahmin,master--Salvation Army."
All this haltingly, and with difficulty. Then he had an inspiration, andbegan to pour out a flood of words that I could make nothing of; so Isaid:
"There--don't do that. I can't understand Hindostani."
"Not Hindostani, master--English. Always I speaking English sometimeswhen I talking every day all the time at you."
"Very well, stick to that; that is intelligible. It is not up to myhopes, it is not up to the promise of the recommendations, still it isEnglish, and I understand it. Don't elaborate it; I don't likeelaborations when they are crippled by uncertainty of touch."
"Master?"
"Oh, never mind; it was only a random thought; I didn't expect you tounderstand it. How did you get your English; is it an acquirement, orjust a gift of God?"
After some hesitation--piously:
"Yes, he very good. Christian god very good, Hindoo god very good, too.Two million Hindoo god, one Christian god--make two million and one. Allmine; two million and one god. I got a plenty. Sometime I pray all timeat those, keep it up, go all time every day; give something at shrine,all good for me, make me better man; good for me, good for my family, damgood."
Then he had another inspiration, and went rambling off into ferventconfusions and incoherencies, and I had to stop him again. I thought wehad talked enough, so I told him to go to the bathroom and clean it upand remove the slops--this to get rid of him. He went away, seeming tounderstand, and got out some of my clothes and began to brush them. Irepeated my desire several times, simplifying and re-simplifying it, andat last he got the idea. Then he went away and put a coolie at the work,and explained that he would lose caste if he did it himself; it would bepollution, by the law of his caste, and it would cost him a deal of fussand trouble to purify himself and accomplish his rehabilitation. He saidthat that kind of work was strictly forbidden to persons of caste, and asstrictly restricted to the very bottom layer of Hindoo society--thedespised 'Sudra' (the toiler, the laborer). He was right; and apparentlythe poor Sudra has been content with his strange lot, his insultingdistinction, for ages and ages--clear back to the beginning of things, soto speak. Buckle says that his name--laborer--is a term of contempt;that it is ordained by the Institutes of Menu (900 B.C.) that if a Sudrasit on a level with his superior he shall be exiled or branded--[Withoutgoing into particulars I will remark that as a rule they wear no clothingthat would conceal the brand.--M. T.] . . . if he speakcontemptuously of his superior or insult him he shall suffer death; if helisten to the reading of the sacred books he shall have burning oilpoured in his ears; if he memorize passages from them he shall be killed;if he marry his daughter to a Brahmin the husband shall go to hell fordefiling himself by contact with a woman so infinitely his inferior; andthat it is forbidden to a Sudra to acquire wealth. "The bulk of thepopulation of India," says Bucklet--[Population to-day, 300,000,000.]--"is the Sudras--the workers, the farmers, the creators of wealth."
Manuel was a failure, poor old fellow. His age was against him. He wasdesperately slow and phenomenally forgetful. When he went three blockson an errand he would be gone two hours, and then forget what it was hewent for. When he packed a trunk it took him forever, and the trunk'scontents were an unimaginable chaos when he got done. He couldn't waitsatisfactorily at table--a prime defect, for if you haven't your ownservant in an Indian hotel you are likely to have a slow time of it andgo away hungry. We couldn't understand his English; he couldn'tunderstand ours; and when we found that he couldn't understand his own,it seemed time for us to part. I had to discharge him; there was no helpfor it. But I did it as kindly as I could, and as gently. We must part,said I, but I hoped we should meet again in a better world. It was nottrue, but it was only a little thing to say, and saved his feelings andcost me nothing.
But now that he was gone, and was off my mind and heart, my spirits beganto rise at once, and I was soon feeling brisk and ready to go out andhave adventures. Then his newly-hired successor flitted in, touched hisforehead, and began to fly around here, there, and everywhere, on hisvelvet feet, and in five minutes he had everything in the room"ship-shape and Bristol fashion," as the sailors say, and was standing atthe salute, waiting for orders. Dear me, what a rustler he was after theslumbrous way of Manuel, poor old slug! All my heart, all my affection,all my admiration, went out spontaneously to this frisky little forkedblack thing, this compact and compressed incarnation of energy and forceand promptness and celerity and confidence, this smart, smily, engaging,shiney-eyed little devil, feruled on his upper end by a gleamingfire-coal of a fez with a red-hot tassel dangling from it. I said,with deep satisfaction--
"You'll suit. What is your name?"
He reeled it mellowly off.
"Let me see if I can make a selection out of it--for business uses, Imean; we will keep the rest for Sundays. Give it to me in installments."
He did it. But there did not seem to be any short ones, exceptMousawhich suggested mouse. It was out of character; it was too soft,too quiet, too conservative; it didn't fit his splendid style. Iconsidered, and said--
"Mousa is short enough, but I don't quite like it. It seems colorless--inharmonious--inadequate; and I am sensitive to such things. How do youthink Satan would do?"
"Yes, master. Satan do wair good."
It was his way of saying "very good."
There was a rap at the door. Satan covered the ground with a singleskip; there was a word or two of Hindostani, then he disappeared. Threeminutes later he was before me again, militarily erect, and waiting forme to speak first.
"What is it, Satan?"
"God want to see you."
"Who?"
"God. I show him up, master?"
"Why, this is so unusual, that--that--well, you see indeed I am sounprepared--I don't quite know what I do mean. Dear me, can't youexplain? Don't you see that this is a most ex----"
"Here his card, master."
Wasn't it curious--and amazing, and tremendous, and all that? Such apersonage going around calling on such as I, and sending up his card,like a mortal--sending it up by Satan. It was a bewildering collision ofthe impossibles. But this was the land of the Arabian Nights, this wasIndia! and what is it that cannot happen in India?
We had the interview. Satan was right--the Visitor was indeed a God inthe conviction of his multitudinous followers, and was worshiped by themin sincerity and humble adoration. They are troubled by no doubts as tohis divine origin and office. They believe in him, they pray to him,they make offerings to him, they beg of him remission of sins; to themhis person, together with everything connected with it, is sacred; fromhis barber they buy the parings of his nails and set them in gold, andwear them as precious amulets.
I tried to seem tranquilly conversational and at rest, but I was not.Would you have been? I was in a suppressed frenzy of excitement andcuriosity and glad wonder. I could not keep my eyes off him. I waslooking upon a god, an actual god, a recognized and accepted god; andevery detail of his person and his dress had a consuming interest for me.And the thought went floating through my head, "He is worshiped--think ofit--he is not a recipient of the pale homage called compliment, wherewiththe highest human clay must make shift to be satisfied, but of aninfinitely richer spiritual food: adoration, worship!--men and women laytheir cares and their griefs and their broken hearts at his feet; and hegives them his peace; and they go away healed."
And just then the Awful Visitor said, in the simplest way--"There is afeature of the philosophy of Huck Finn which"--and went luminously onwith the construction of a compact and nicely-discriminated literaryverdict.
It is a land of surprises--India! I had had my ambitions--I had hoped,and almost expected, to be read by kings and presidents and emperors--butI had never looked so high as That. It would be false modesty to pretendthat I was not inordinately pleased. I was. I was much more pleasedthan I should have been with a compliment from a man.
He remained half an hour, and I found him a most courteous and charminggentleman. The godship has been in his family a good while, but I do notknow how long. He is a Mohammedan deity; by earthly rank he is a prince;not an Indian but a Persian prince. He is a direct descendant of theProphet's line. He is comely; also young--for a god; not forty, perhapsnot above thirty-five years old. He wears his immense honors withtranquil brace, and with a dignity proper to his awful calling. Hespeaks English with the ease and purity of a person born to it. I thinkI am not overstating this. He was the only god I had ever seen, and Iwas very favorably impressed. When he rose to say good-bye, the doorswung open and I caught the flash of a red fez, and heard these words,reverently said--
"Satan see God out?"
"Yes." And these mis-mated Beings passed from view Satan in the lead andThe Other following after.
