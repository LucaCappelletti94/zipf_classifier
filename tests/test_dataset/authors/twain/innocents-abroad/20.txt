We left Milan by rail. The Cathedral six or seven miles behind us; vast,dreamy, bluish, snow-clad mountains twenty miles in front of us,--thesewere the accented points in the scenery. The more immediate sceneryconsisted of fields and farm-houses outside the car and a monster-headeddwarf and a moustached woman inside it. These latter were notshow-people. Alas, deformity and female beards are too common in Italyto attract attention.
We passed through a range of wild, picturesque hills, steep, wooded,cone-shaped, with rugged crags projecting here and there, and withdwellings and ruinous castles perched away up toward the drifting clouds.We lunched at the curious old town of Como, at the foot of the lake, andthen took the small steamer and had an afternoon's pleasure excursion tothis place,--Bellaggio.
When we walked ashore, a party of policemen (people whose cocked hats andshowy uniforms would shame the finest uniform in the military service ofthe United States,) put us into a little stone cell and locked us in. Wehad the whole passenger list for company, but their room would have beenpreferable, for there was no light, there were no windows, noventilation. It was close and hot. We were much crowded. It was theBlack Hole of Calcutta on a small scale. Presently a smoke rose aboutour feet--a smoke that smelled of all the dead things of earth, of allthe putrefaction and corruption imaginable.
We were there five minutes, and when we got out it was hard to tell whichof us carried the vilest fragrance.
These miserable outcasts called that "fumigating" us, and the term was atame one indeed. They fumigated us to guard themselves against thecholera, though we hailed from no infected port. We had left the cholerafar behind us all the time. However, they must keep epidemics awaysomehow or other, and fumigation is cheaper than soap. They must eitherwash themselves or fumigate other people. Some of the lower classes hadrather die than wash, but the fumigation of strangers causes them nopangs. They need no fumigation themselves. Their habits make itunnecessary. They carry their preventive with them; they sweat andfumigate all the day long. I trust I am a humble and a consistentChristian. I try to do what is right. I know it is my duty to "pray forthem that despitefully use me;" and therefore, hard as it is, I shallstill try to pray for these fumigating, maccaroni-stuffingorgan-grinders.
Our hotel sits at the water's edge--at least its front garden does--andwe walk among the shrubbery and smoke at twilight; we look afar off atSwitzerland and the Alps, and feel an indolent willingness to look nocloser; we go down the steps and swim in the lake; we take a shapelylittle boat and sail abroad among the reflections of the stars; lie onthe thwarts and listen to the distant laughter, the singing, the softmelody of flutes and guitars that comes floating across the water frompleasuring gondolas; we close the evening with exasperating billiards onone of those same old execrable tables. A midnight luncheon in our amplebed-chamber; a final smoke in its contracted veranda facing the water,the gardens, and the mountains; a summing up of the day's events. Thento bed, with drowsy brains harassed with a mad panorama that mixes uppictures of France, of Italy, of the ship, of the ocean, of home, ingrotesque and bewildering disorder. Then a melting away of familiarfaces, of cities, and of tossing waves, into a great calm offorgetfulness and peace.
After which, the nightmare.
Breakfast in the morning, and then the lake.
I did not like it yesterday. I thought Lake Tahoe was much finer.I have to confess now, however, that my judgment erred somewhat, thoughnot extravagantly. I always had an idea that Como was a vast basin ofwater, like Tahoe, shut in by great mountains. Well, the border of hugemountains is here, but the lake itself is not a basin. It is as crookedas any brook, and only from one-quarter to two-thirds as wide as theMississippi. There is not a yard of low ground on either side of it--nothing but endless chains of mountains that spring abruptly from thewater's edge and tower to altitudes varying from a thousand to twothousand feet. Their craggy sides are clothed with vegetation, and whitespecks of houses peep out from the luxuriant foliage everywhere; they areeven perched upon jutting and picturesque pinnacles a thousand feet aboveyour head.
Again, for miles along the shores, handsome country seats, surrounded bygardens and groves, sit fairly in the water, sometimes in nooks carved byNature out of the vine-hung precipices, and with no ingress or egresssave by boats. Some have great broad stone staircases leading down tothe water, with heavy stone balustrades ornamented with statuary andfancifully adorned with creeping vines and bright-colored flowers--forall the world like a drop curtain in a theatre, and lacking nothing butlong-waisted, high-heeled women and plumed gallants in silken tightscoming down to go serenading in the splendid gondola in waiting.
A great feature of Como's attractiveness is the multitude of prettyhouses and gardens that cluster upon its shores and on its mountainsides. They look so snug and so homelike, and at eventide when everything seems to slumber, and the music of the vesper bells comes stealingover the water, one almost believes that nowhere else than on the lake ofComo can there be found such a paradise of tranquil repose.
From my window here in Bellaggio, I have a view of the other side of thelake now, which is as beautiful as a picture. A scarred and wrinkledprecipice rises to a height of eighteen hundred feet; on a tiny benchhalf way up its vast wall, sits a little snowflake of a church, no biggerthan a martin-box, apparently; skirting the base of the cliff are ahundred orange groves and gardens, flecked with glimpses of the whitedwellings that are buried in them; in front, three or four gondolas lieidle upon the water--and in the burnished mirror of the lake, mountain,chapel, houses, groves and boats are counterfeited so brightly and soclearly that one scarce knows where the reality leaves off and thereflection begins!
The surroundings of this picture are fine. A mile away, a grove-plumedpromontory juts far into the lake and glasses its palace in the bluedepths; in midstream a boat is cutting the shining surface and leaving along track behind, like a ray of light; the mountains beyond are veiledin a dreamy purple haze; far in the opposite direction a tumbled mass ofdomes and verdant slopes and valleys bars the lake, and here indeed doesdistance lend enchantment to the view--for on this broad canvas, sun andclouds and the richest of atmospheres have blended a thousand tintstogether, and over its surface the filmy lights and shadows drift, hourafter hour, and glorify it with a beauty that seems reflected out ofHeaven itself. Beyond all question, this is the most voluptuous scene wehave yet looked upon.
Last night the scenery was striking and picturesque. On the other sidecrags and trees and snowy houses were reflected in the lake with awonderful distinctness, and streams of light from many a distant windowshot far abroad over the still waters. On this side, near at hand, greatmansions, white with moonlight, glared out from the midst of masses offoliage that lay black and shapeless in the shadows that fell from thecliff above--and down in the margin of the lake every feature of theweird vision was faithfully repeated.
Today we have idled through a wonder of a garden attached to a ducalestate--but enough of description is enough, I judge.
I suspect that this was the same place the gardener's son deceived theLady of Lyons with, but I do not know. You may have heard of the passagesomewhere:
 "A deep vale, Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world, Near a clear lake margined by fruits of gold And whispering myrtles: Glassing softest skies, cloudless, Save with rare and roseate shadows; A palace, lifting to eternal heaven its marbled walls, From out a glossy bower of coolest foliage musical with birds."
That is all very well, except the "clear" part of the lake. It certainlyis clearer than a great many lakes, but how dull its waters are comparedwith the wonderful transparence of Lake Tahoe! I speak of the northshore of Tahoe, where one can count the scales on a trout at a depth of ahundred and eighty feet. I have tried to get this statement off at parhere, but with no success; so I have been obliged to negotiate it atfifty percent discount. At this rate I find some takers; perhaps thereader will receive it on the same terms--ninety feet instead of onehundred and eighty. But let it be remembered that those are forcedterms--Sheriff's sale prices. As far as I am privately concerned, Iabate not a jot of the original assertion that in those strangelymagnifying waters one may count the scales on a trout (a trout of thelarge kind,) at a depth of a hundred and eighty feet--may see everypebble on the bottom--might even count a paper of dray-pins. People talkof the transparent waters of the Mexican Bay of Acapulco, but in my ownexperience I know they cannot compare with those I am speaking of. Ihave fished for trout, in Tahoe, and at a measured depth of eighty-fourfeet I have seen them put their noses to the bait and I could see theirgills open and shut. I could hardly have seen the trout themselves atthat distance in the open air.
As I go back in spirit and recall that noble sea, reposing among thesnow-peaks six thousand feet above the ocean, the conviction comes strongupon me again that Como would only seem a bedizened little courtier inthat august presence.
Sorrow and misfortune overtake the legislature that still from year toyear permits Tahoe to retain its unmusical cognomen! Tahoe! It suggestsno crystal waters, no picturesque shores, no sublimity. Tahoe for a seain the clouds: a sea that has character and asserts it in solemn calms attimes, at times in savage storms; a sea whose royal seclusion is guardedby a cordon of sentinel peaks that lift their frosty fronts nine thousandfeet above the level world; a sea whose every aspect is impressive, whosebelongings are all beautiful, whose lonely majesty types the Deity!
Tahoe means grasshoppers. It means grasshopper soup. It is Indian, andsuggestive of Indians. They say it is Pi-ute--possibly it is Digger.I am satisfied it was named by the Diggers--those degraded savages whoroast their dead relatives, then mix the human grease and ashes of boneswith tar, and "gaum" it thick all over their heads and foreheads andears, and go caterwauling about the hills and call it mourning. Theseare the gentry that named the Lake.
People say that Tahoe means "Silver Lake"--"Limpid Water"--"FallingLeaf." Bosh. It means grasshopper soup, the favorite dish of the Diggertribe,--and of the Pi-utes as well. It isn't worth while, in thesepractical times, for people to talk about Indian poetry--there never wasany in them--except in the Fenimore Cooper Indians. But they are anextinct tribe that never existed. I know the Noble Red Man. I havecamped with the Indians; I have been on the warpath with them, taken partin the chase with them--for grasshoppers; helped them steal cattle; Ihave roamed with them, scalped them, had them for breakfast. I wouldgladly eat the whole race if I had a chance.
But I am growing unreliable. I will return to my comparison of thelakes. Como is a little deeper than Tahoe, if people here tell thetruth. They say it is eighteen hundred feet deep at this point, but itdoes not look a dead enough blue for that. Tahoe is one thousand fivehundred and twenty-five feet deep in the centre, by the state geologist'smeasurement. They say the great peak opposite this town is five thousandfeet high: but I feel sure that three thousand feet of that statement isa good honest lie. The lake is a mile wide, here, and maintains aboutthat width from this point to its northern extremity--which is distantsixteen miles: from here to its southern extremity--say fifteen miles--itis not over half a mile wide in any place, I should think. Its snow-cladmountains one hears so much about are only seen occasionally, and then inthe distance, the Alps. Tahoe is from ten to eighteen miles wide, andits mountains shut it in like a wall. Their summits are never free fromsnow the year round. One thing about it is very strange: it never haseven a skim of ice upon its surface, although lakes in the same range ofmountains, lying in a lower and warmer temperature, freeze over inwinter.
It is cheerful to meet a shipmate in these out-of-the-way places andcompare notes with him. We have found one of ours here--an old soldierof the war, who is seeking bloodless adventures and rest from hiscampaigns in these sunny lands.--[Colonel J.
