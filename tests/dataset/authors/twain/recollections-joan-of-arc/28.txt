Joan Makes Cowards Brave Victors
THE NEXT day Joan wanted to go against the enemy again, but it was thefeast of the Ascension, and the holy council of bandit generals were toopious to be willing to profane it with bloodshed. But privately theyprofaned it with plottings, a sort of industry just in their line. Theydecided to do the only thing proper to do now in the new circumstances ofthe case--feign an attack on the most important bastille on the Orleansside, and then, if the English weakened the far more important fortresseson the other side of the river to come to its help, cross in force andcapture those works. This would give them the bridge and freecommunication with the Sologne, which was French territory. They decidedto keep this latter part of the program secret from Joan.
Joan intruded and took them by surprise. She asked them what they wereabout and what they had resolved upon. They said they had resolved toattack the most important of the English bastilles on the Orleans sidenext morning--and there the spokesman stopped. Joan said:
"Well, go on."
"There is nothing more. That is all."
"Am I to believe this? That is to say, am I to believe that you have lostyour wits?" She turned to Dunois, and said, "Bastard, you have sense,answer me this: if this attack is made and the bastille taken, how muchbetter off would we be than we are now?"
The Bastard hesitated, and then began some rambling talk not quitegermane to the question. Joan interrupted him and said:
"That will not do, good Bastard, you have answered. Since the Bastard isnot able to mention any advantage to be gained by taking that bastilleand stopping there, it is not likely that any of you could better thematter. You waste much time here in inventing plans that lead to nothing,and making delays that are a damage. Are you concealing something fromme? Bastard, this council has a general plan, I take it; without goinginto details, what is it?"
"It is the same it was in the beginning, seven months ago--to getprovisions for a long siege, then sit down and tire the English out."
"In the name of God! As if seven months was not enough, you want toprovide for a year of it. Now ye shall drop these pusillanimousdreams--the English shall go in three days!"
Several exclaimed:
"Ah, General, General, be prudent!"
"Be prudent and starve? Do ye call that war? I tell you this, if you donot already know it: The new circumstances have changed the face ofmatters. The true point of attack has shifted; it is on the other side ofthe river now. One must take the fortifications that command the bridge.The English know that if we are not fools and cowards we will try to dothat. They are grateful for your piety in wasting this day. They willreinforce the bridge forts from this side to-night, knowing what ought tohappen to-morrow. You have but lost a day and made our task harder, forwe will cross and take the bridge forts. Bastard, tell me the truth--doesnot this council know that there is no other course for us than the one Iam speaking of?"
Dunois conceded that the council did know it to be the most desirable,but considered it impracticable; and he excused the council as well as hecould by saying that inasmuch as nothing was really and rationally to behoped for but a long continuance of the siege and wearying out of theEnglish, they were naturally a little afraid of Joan's impetuous notions.He said:
"You see, we are sure that the waiting game is the best, whereas youwould carry everything by storm."
"That I would!--and moreover that I will! You have my orders--here andnow. We will move upon the forts of the south bank to-morrow at dawn."
"And carry them by storm?"
"Yes, carry them by storm!"
La Hire came clanking in, and heard the last remark. He cried out:
"By my baton, that is the music I love to hear! Yes, that is the righttime and the beautiful words, my General--we will carry them by storm!"
He saluted in his large way and came up and shook Joan by the hand.
Some member of the council was heard to say:
"It follows, then, that we must begin with the bastille St. John, andthat will give the English time to--"
Joan turned and said:
"Give yourselves no uneasiness about the bastille St. John. The Englishwill know enough to retire from it and fall back on the bridge bastilleswhen they see us coming." She added, with a touch of sarcasm, "Even awar-council would know enough to do that itself."
Then she took her leave. La Hire made this general remark to the council:
"She is a child, and that is all ye seem to see. Keep to thatsuperstition if you must, but you perceive that this child understandsthis complex game of war as well as any of you; and if you want myopinion without the trouble of asking for it, here you have it withoutruffles or embroidery--by God, I think she can teach the best of you howto play it!"
Joan had spoken truly; the sagacious English saw that the policy of theFrench had undergone a revolution; that the policy of paltering anddawdling was ended; that in place of taking blows, blows were ready to bestruck now; therefore they made ready for the new state of things bytransferring heavy reinforcements to the bastilles of the south bank fromthose of the north.
The city learned the great news that once more in French history, afterall these humiliating years, France was going to take the offensive; thatFrance, so used to retreating, was going to advance; that France, so longaccustomed to skulking, was going to face about and strike. The joy ofthe people passed all bounds. The city walls were black with them to seethe army march out in the morning in that strange new position--itsfront, not its tail, toward an English camp. You shall imagine foryourselves what the excitement was like and how it expressed itself, whenJoan rode out at the head of the host with her banner floating above her.
We crossed the five in strong force, and a tedious long job it was, forthe boats were small and not numerous. Our landing on the island of St.Aignan was not disputed. We threw a bridge of a few boats across thenarrow channel thence to the south shore and took up our march in goodorder and unmolested; for although there was a fortress there--St.John--the English vacated and destroyed it and fell back on the bridgeforts below as soon as our first boats were seen to leave the Orleansshore; which was what Joan had said would happen, when she was disputingwith the council.
We moved down the shore and Joan planted her standard before the bastilleof the Augustins, the first of the formidable works that protected theend of the bridge. The trumpets sounded the assault, and two chargesfollowed in handsome style; but we were too weak, as yet, for our mainbody was still lagging behind. Before we could gather for a third assaultthe garrison of St. Prive were seen coming up to reinforce the bigbastille. They came on a run, and the Augustins sallied out, and bothforces came against us with a rush, and sent our small army flying in apanic, and followed us, slashing and slaying, and shouting jeers andinsults at us.
Joan was doing her best to rally the men, but their wits were gone, theirhearts were dominated for the moment by the old-time dread of theEnglish. Joan's temper flamed up, and she halted and commanded thetrumpets to sound the advance. Then she wheeled about and cried out:
"If there is but a dozen of you that are not cowards, it isenough--follow me!"
Away she went, and after her a few dozen who had heard her words and beeninspired by them. The pursuing force was astonished to see her sweepingdown upon them with this handful of men, and it was their turn now toexperience a grisly fright--surely this is a witch, this is a child ofSatan! That was their thought--and without stopping to analyze the matterthey turned and fled in a panic.
Our flying squadrons heard the bugle and turned to look; and when theysaw the Maid's banner speeding in the other direction and the enemyscrambling ahead of it in disorder, their courage returned and they camescouring after us.
La Hire heard it and hurried his force forward and caught up with us justas we were planting our banner again before the ramparts of theAugustins. We were strong enough now. We had a long and tough piece ofwork before us, but we carried it through before night, Joan keeping ushard at it, and she and La Hire saying we were able to take that bigbastille, and must. The English fought like--well, they fought like theEnglish; when that is said, there is no more to say. We made assaultafter assault, through the smoke and flame and the deafeningcannon-blasts, and at last as the sun was sinking we carried the placewith a rush, and planted our standard on its walls.
The Augustins was ours. The Tourelles must be ours, too, if we would freethe bridge and raise the siege. We had achieved one great undertaking,Joan was determined to accomplish the other. We must lie on our armswhere we were, hold fast to what we had got, and be ready for business inthe morning. So Joan was not minded to let the men be demoralized bypillage and riot and carousings; she had the Augustins burned, with allits stores in it, excepting the artillery and ammunition.
Everybody was tired out with this long day's hard work, and of coursethis was the case with Joan; still, she wanted to stay with the armybefore the Tourelles, to be ready for the assault in the morning. Thechiefs argued with her, and at last persuaded her to go home and preparefor the great work by taking proper rest, and also by having a leech lookto a wound which she had received in her foot. So we crossed with themand went home.
Just as usual, we found the town in a fury of joy, all the bellsclanging, everybody shouting, and several people drunk. We never went outor came in without furnishing good and sufficient reasons for one ofthese pleasant tempests, and so the tempest was always on hand. There hadbeen a blank absence of reasons for this sort of upheavals for the pastseven months, therefore the people too to the upheavals with all the morerelish on that account.
