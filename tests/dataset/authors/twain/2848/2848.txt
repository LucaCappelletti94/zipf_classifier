[From the Buffalo Express, September 11, 1889.] 
     Marshal Neil's last words were: "L'armee fran-caise!" (The French     army.)--Exchange.

What a sad thing it is to see a man close a grand career with aplagiarism in his mouth. Napoleon's last words were: "Tete d'armee."(Head of the army.) Neither of those remarks amounts to anything as"last words," and reflect little credit upon the utterers.
A distinguished man should be as particular about his last words as he isabout his last breath. He should write them out on a slip of paper andtake the judgment of his friends on them. He should never leave such athing to the last hour of his life, and trust to an intellectual spiritat the last moment to enable him to say something smart with his latestgasp and launch into eternity with grandeur. No--a man is apt to be toomuch fagged and exhausted, both in body and mind, at such a time, to bereliable; and maybe the very thing he wants to say, he cannot think of tosave him; and besides there are his weeping friends bothering around;and worse than all as likely as not he may have to deliver his last gaspbefore he is expecting to. A man cannot always expect to think of anatty thing to say under such circumstances, and so it is pure egotisticostentation to put it off. There is hardly a case on record where a mancame to his last moment unprepared and said a good thing hardly a casewhere a man trusted to that last moment and did not make a solemn botchof it and go out of the world feeling absurd.
Now there was Daniel Webster. Nobody could tell him anything. He wasnot afraid. He could do something neat when the time came. And how didit turn out? Why, his will had to be fixed over; and then all therelations came; and first one thing and then another interfered, till atlast he only had a chance to say, "I still live," and up he went.
Of course he didn't still live, because he died--and so he might as wellhave kept his last words to himself as to have gone and made such afailure of it as that. A week before that fifteen minutes of calmreflection would have enabled that man to contrive some last words thatwould have been a credit to himself and a comfort to his family forgenerations to come.
And there was John Quincy Adams. Relying on his splendid abilities andhis coolness in emergencies, he trusted to a happy hit at the last momentto carry him through, and what was the result? Death smote him in theHouse of Representatives, and he observed, casually, "This is the last ofearth." The last of earth! Why "the last of earth" when there was somuch more left? If he had said it was the last rose of summer or thelast run of shad, it would have had as much point in it. What he meantto say was, "Adam was the first and Adams is the last of earth," but heput it off a trifle too long, and so he had to go with that unmeaningobservation on his lips.
And there we have Napoleon's "Tete d'armee." That don't mean anything.Taken by itself, "Head of the army," is no more important than "Head ofthe police." And yet that was a man who could have said a good thing ifhe had barred out the doctor and studied over it a while. Marshal Neil,with half a century at his disposal, could not dash off anything betterin his last moments than a poor plagiarism of another man's words, whichwere not worth plagiarizing in the first place. "The French army."Perfectly irrelevant--perfectly flat utterly pointless. But if he hadclosed one eye significantly, and said, "The subscriber has made itlively for the French army," and then thrown a little of the comic intohis last gasp, it would have been a thing to remember with satisfactionall the rest of his life. I do wish our great men would quit sayingthese flat things just at the moment they die. Let us have theirnext-to-the-last words for a while, and see if we cannot patch up fromthem something that will be more satisfactory.
The public does not wish to be outraged in this way all the time.
But when we come to call to mind the last words of parties who took thetrouble to make the proper preparation for the occasion, we immediatelynotice a happy difference in the result.
There was Chesterfield. Lord Chesterfield had laboured all his life tobuild up the most shining reputation for affability and elegance ofspeech and manners the world has ever seen. And could you suppose hefailed to appreciate the efficiency of characteristic "last words," inthe matter of seizing the successfully driven nail of such a reputationand clinching on the other side for ever? Not he. He prepared himself.He kept his eye on the clock and his finger on his pulse. He awaited hischance. And at last, when he knew his time was come, he pretended tothink a new visitor had entered, and so, with the rattle in his throatemphasised for dramatic effect, he said to the servant, "Shin around,John, and get the gentleman a chair." And so he died, amid thunders ofapplause.
Next we have Benjamin Franklin. Franklin, the author of Poor Richard'squaint sayings; Franklin the immortal axiom-builder, who used to sit upat nights reducing the rankest old threadbare platitudes to crisp andsnappy maxims that had a nice, varnished, original look in theirregimentals; who said, "Virtue is its own reward;" who said,"Procrastination is the thief of time;" who said, "Time and tide wait forno man" and "Necessity is the mother of invention;" good old Franklin,the Josh Billings of the eighteenth century--though, sooth to say, thelatter transcends him in proverbial originality as much as he falls shortof him in correctness of orthography. What sort of tactics did Franklinpursue? He pondered over his last words for as much as two weeks, andthen when the time came, he said, "None but the brave deserve the fair,"and died happy. He could not have said a sweeter thing if he had livedtill he was an idiot.
Byron made a poor business of it, and could not think of anything to say,at the last moment but, "Augusta--sister--Lady Byron--tell HarrietBeecher Stowe"--etc., etc.,--but Shakespeare was ready and said, "Englandexpects every man to do his duty!" and went off with splendid eclat.
And there are other instances of sagacious preparation for a felicitousclosing remark. For instance:
Joan of Arc said, "Tramp, tramp, tramp the boys are marching."
Alexander the Great said, "Another of those Santa Cruz punches, if youplease."
The Empress Josephine said, "Not for Jo-" and could get no further.
Cleopatra said, "The Old Guard dies, but never surrenders."
Sir Walter Raleigh said, "Executioner, can I take your whetstone amoment, please?" though what for is not clear.
John Smith said, "Alas, I am the last of my race."
Queen Elizabeth said, "Oh, I would give my kingdom for one moment more--I have forgotten my last words."
And Red Jacket, the noblest Indian brave that ever wielded a tomahawk indefence of a friendless and persecuted race, expired with these touchingwords upon his lips, "Wawkawampanoosucwinnebayowallazvsagamoresa-skatchewan." There was not a dry eye in the wigwam.
Let not this lesson be lost upon our public men. Let them take a healthymoment for preparation, and contrive some last words that shall be neatand to the point. Let Louis Napoleon say,
"I am content to follow my uncle--still, I do not wish to improve uponhis last word. Put me down for 'Tete d'armee.'"
And Garret Davis, "Let me recite the unabridged dictionary."
And H. G., "I desire, now, to say a few words on political economy."
And Mr. Bergh, "Only take part of me at a time, if the load will befatiguing to the hearse horses."
And Andrew Johnson, "I have been an alderman, Member of Congress,Governor, Senator, Pres--adieu, you know the rest."
And Seward., "Alas!-ka."
And Grant, "O."
All of which is respectfully submitted, with the most honorableintentions. M. T.
