"Be done, boys! Who's there?"
I says:
"It's me."
"Who's me?"
"George Jackson, sir."
"What do you want?"
"I don't want nothing, sir. I only want to goalong by, but the dogs won't let me."
"What are you prowling around here this time ofnight for -- hey?"
"I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard offof the steamboat."
"Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, some-body. What did you say your name was?"
"George Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy."
"Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn'tbe afraid -- nobody'll hurt you. But don't try tobudge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Boband Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. GeorgeJackson, is there anybody with you?"
"No, sir, nobody."
I heard the people stirring around in the house now,and see a light. The man sung out:
"Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool -- ain'tyou got any sense? Put it on the floor behind thefront door. Bob, if you and Tom are ready, takeyour places."
"All ready."
"Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherd-sons?"
"No, sir; I never heard of them."
"Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, allready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind,don't you hurry -- come mighty slow. If there's any-body with you, let him keep back -- if he shows him-self he'll be shot. Come along now. Come slow;push the door open yourself -- just enough to squeezein, d' you hear?"
I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. Itook one slow step at a time and there warn't a sound,only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs wereas still as the humans, but they followed a little behindme. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heardthem unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I putmy hand on the door and pushed it a little and a littlemore till somebody said, "There, that's enough -- putyour head in." I done it, but I judged they wouldtake it off.
The candle was on the floor, and there they all was,looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter ofa minute: Three big men with guns pointed at me,which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray andabout sixty, the other two thirty or more -- all of themfine and handsome -- and the sweetest old gray-headedlady, and back of her two young women which Icouldn't see right well. The old gentleman says:
"There; I reckon it's all right. Come in."
As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked thedoor and barred it and bolted it, and told the youngmen to come in with their guns, and they all went in abig parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, andgot together in a corner that was out of the range ofthe front windows -- there warn't none on the side.They held the candle, and took a good look at me,and all said, "Why, HE ain't a Shepherdson -- no,there ain't any Shepherdson about him." Then theold man said he hoped I wouldn't mind being searchedfor arms, because he didn't mean no harm by it -- itwas only to make sure. So he didn't pry into mypockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and saidit was all right. He told me to make myself easy andat home, and tell all about myself; but the old ladysays:
"Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet ashe can be; and don't you reckon it may be he'shungry?"
"True for you, Rachel -- I forgot."
So the old lady says:
"Betsy" (this was a nigger woman), you fly aroundand get him something to eat as quick as you can, poorthing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck andtell him -- oh, here he is himself. Buck, take thislittle stranger and get the wet clothes off from him anddress him up in some of yours that's dry."
Buck looked about as old as me -- thirteen or four-teen or along there, though he was a little bigger thanme. He hadn't on anything but a shirt, and he wasvery frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and diggingone fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun alongwith the other one. He says:
"Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?"
They said, no, 'twas a false alarm.
"Well," he says, "if they'd a ben some, I reckonI'd a got one."
They all laughed, and Bob says:
"Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you'vebeen so slow in coming."
"Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't rightI'm always kept down; I don't get no show."
"Never mind, Buck, my boy," says the old man,"you'll have show enough, all in good time, don'tyou fret about that. Go 'long with you now, and doas your mother told you."
When we got up-stairs to his room he got me acoarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his, and Iput them on. While I was at it he asked me what myname was, but before I could tell him he started to tellme about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catchedin the woods day before yesterday, and he asked mewhere Moses was when the candle went out. I said Ididn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way.
"Well, guess," he says.
"How'm I going to guess," says I, "when I neverheard tell of it before?"
"But you can guess, can't you? It's just as easy."
"WHICH candle?" I says.
"Why, any candle," he says.
"I don't know where he was," says I; "wherewas he?"
"Why, he was in the DARK! That's where he was!"
"Well, if you knowed where he was, what did youask me for?"
"Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say,how long are you going to stay here? You got tostay always. We can just have booming times -- theydon't have no school now. Do you own a dog?I've got a dog -- and he'll go in the river and bringout chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb upSundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet Idon't, but ma she makes me. Confound these olebritches! I reckon I'd better put 'em on, but I'druther not, it's so warm. Are you all ready? Allright. Come along, old hoss."
Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and butter-milk -- that is what they had for me down there, andthere ain't nothing better that ever I've come acrossyet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cobpipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, andthe two young women. They all smoked and talked,and I eat and talked. The young women had quiltsaround them, and their hair down their backs. Theyall asked me questions, and I told them how pap andme and all the family was living on a little farm downat the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Annrun off and got married and never was heard of nomore, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heardof no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then therewarn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he wasjust trimmed down to nothing, on account of histroubles; so when he died I took what there was left,because the farm didn't belong to us, and started upthe river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and thatwas how I come to be here. So they said I couldhave a home there as long as I wanted it. Then itwas most daylight and everybody went to bed, and Iwent to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in themorning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was.So I laid there about an hour trying to think, andwhen Buck waked up I says:
"Can you spell, Buck?"
"Yes," he says.
"I bet you can't spell my name," says I.
"I bet you what you dare I can," says he.
"All right," says I, "go ahead."
"G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n -- there now," he says.
"Well," says I, "you done it, but I didn't thinkyou could. It ain't no slouch of a name to spell --right off without studying."
I set it down, private, because somebody might wantME to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy withit and rattle it off like I was used to it.
It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nicehouse, too. I hadn't seen no house out in the countrybefore that was so nice and had so much style. Itdidn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor awooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knobto turn, the same as houses in town. There warn't nobed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps ofparlors in towns has beds in them. There was a bigfireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and thebricks was kept clean and red by pouring water onthem and scrubbing them with another brick; some-times they wash them over with red water-paint thatthey call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town.They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantel-piece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottomhalf of the glass front, and a round place in the middleof it for the sun, and you could see the pendulumswinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clocktick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers hadbeen along and scoured her up and got her in goodshape, she would start in and strike a hundred andfifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn't tookany money for her.
Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each sideof the clock, made out of something like chalk, andpainted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a catmade of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other;and when you pressed down on them they squeaked,but didn't open their mouths nor look different norinterested. They squeaked through underneath. Therewas a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread outbehind those things. On the table in the middle ofthe room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket thatbad apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piledup in it, which was much redder and yellower andprettier than real ones is, but they warn't real becauseyou could see where pieces had got chipped off andshowed the white chalk, or whatever it was, under-neath.
This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth,with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and apainted border all around. It come all the way fromPhiladelphia, they said. There was some books, too,piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One wasPilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his family, itdidn't say why. I read considerable in it now andthen. The statements was interesting, but tough.Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautifulstuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry. An-other was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another wasDr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all aboutwhat to do if a body was sick or dead. There was ahymn book, and a lot of other books. And there wasnice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too --not bagged down in the middle and busted, like anold basket.
They had pictures hung on the walls -- mainlyWashingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and High-land Marys, and one called "Signing the Declaration."There was some that they called crayons, which one ofthe daughters which was dead made her own self whenshe was only fifteen years old. They was differentfrom any pictures I ever see before -- blacker, mostly,than is common. One was a woman in a slim blackdress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges likea cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a largeblack scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and whiteslim ankles crossed about with black tape, and verywee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaningpensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under aweeping willow, and her other hand hanging down herside holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, andunderneath the picture it said "Shall I Never See TheeMore Alas." Another one was a young lady with herhair all combed up straight to the top of her head, andknotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, andshe was crying into a handkerchief and had a deadbird laying on its back in her other hand with its heelsup, and underneath the picture it said "I Shall NeverHear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas." There was onewhere a young lady was at a window looking up at themoon, and tears running down her cheeks; and shehad an open letter in one hand with black sealing waxshowing on one edge of it, and she was mashing alocket with a chain to it against her mouth, and under-neath the picture it said "And Art Thou Gone YesThou Art Gone Alas." These was all nice pictures, Ireckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them,because if ever I was down a little they always give methe fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, becauseshe had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do,and a body could see by what she had done what theyhad lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition shewas having a better time in the graveyard. She wasat work on what they said was her greatest picturewhen she took sick, and every day and every night itwas her prayer to be allowed to live till she got itdone, but she never got the chance. It was a pictureof a young woman in a long white gown, standing onthe rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hairall down her back, and looking up to the moon, withthe tears running down her face, and she had two armsfolded across her breast, and two arms stretched out infront, and two more reaching up towards the moon --and the idea was to see which pair would look best,and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I wassaying, she died before she got her mind made up,and now they kept this picture over the head of thebed in her room, and every time her birthday comethey hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid witha little curtain. The young woman in the picture had akind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many armsit made her look too spidery, seemed to me.
This young girl kept a scrap-book when she wasalive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents andcases of patient suffering in it out of the PresbyterianObserver, and write poetry after them out of her ownhead. It was very good poetry. This is what shewrote about a boy by the name of Stephen DowlingBots that fell down a well and was drownded:
  ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D
  And did young Stephen sicken,    And did young Stephen die?  And did the sad hearts thicken,    And did the mourners cry?
  No; such was not the fate of    Young Stephen Dowling Bots;  Though sad hearts round him thickened,    'Twas not from sickness' shots.
  No whooping-cough did rack his frame,    Nor measles drear with spots;  Not these impaired the sacred name    Of Stephen Dowling Bots.
  Despised love struck not with woe    That head of curly knots,  Nor stomach troubles laid him low,    Young Stephen Dowling Bots.
  O no. Then list with tearful eye,    Whilst I his fate do tell.  His soul did from this cold world fly    By falling down a well.
  They got him out and emptied him;    Alas it was too late;  His spirit was gone for to sport aloft    In the realms of the good and great.
If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry likethat before she was fourteen, there ain't no tellingwhat she could a done by and by. Buck said shecould rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't everhave to stop to think. He said she would slap down aline, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with itwould just scratch it out and slap down another one,and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could writeabout anything you choose to give her to write aboutjust so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or awoman died, or a child died, she would be on handwith her "tribute" before he was cold. She calledthem tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctorfirst, then Emmeline, then the undertaker -- the under-taker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, andthen she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person'sname, which was Whistler. She warn't ever the sameafter that; she never complained, but she kinder pinedaway and did not live long. Poor thing, many's thetime I made myself go up to the little room that usedto be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book andread in it when her pictures had been aggravating meand I had soured on her a little. I liked all thatfamily, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let any-thing come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetryabout all the dead people when she was alive, and itdidn't seem right that there warn't nobody to makesome about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweatout a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to makeit go somehow. They kept Emmeline's room trimand nice, and all the things fixed in it just the wayshe liked to have them when she was alive, and nobodyever slept there. The old lady took care of the roomherself, though there was plenty of niggers, and shesewed there a good deal and read her Bible theremostly.
Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there wasbeautiful curtains on the windows: white, with picturespainted on them of castles with vines all down thewalls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was alittle old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon,and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the youngladies sing "The Last Link is Broken" and play "TheBattle of Prague" on it. The walls of all the roomswas plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, andthe whole house was whitewashed on the outside.
It was a double house, and the big open place be-twixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes thetable was set there in the middle of the day, and it wasa cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn't be better.And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of ittoo!
