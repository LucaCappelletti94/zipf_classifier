The Autocrat of Russia possesses more power than any other man in theearth; but he cannot stop a sneeze. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
WAUGANIUI, December 3. A pleasant trip, yesterday, per Ballarat Fly.Four hours. I do not know the distance, but it must have been well alongtoward fifty miles. The Fly could have spun it out to eight hours andnot discommoded me; for where there is comfort, and no need for hurry,speed is of no value--at least to me; and nothing that goes on wheels canbe more comfortable, more satisfactory, than the New Zealand trains.Outside of America there are no cars that are so rationally devised.When you add the constant presence of charming scenery and the nearlyconstant absence of dust--well, if one is not content then, he ought toget out and walk. That would change his spirit, perhaps? I think so.At the end of an hour you would find him waiting humbly beside the track,and glad to be taken aboard again.
Much horseback riding, in and around this town; many comely girls in cooland pretty summer gowns; much Salvation Army; lots of Maoris; the facesand bodies of some of the old ones very tastefully frescoed. MaoriCouncil House over the river-large, strong, carpeted from end to end withmatting, and decorated with elaborate wood carvings, artisticallyexecuted. The Maoris were very polite.
I was assured by a member of the House of Representatives that the nativerace is not decreasing, but actually increasing slightly. It is anotherevidence that they are a superior breed of savages. I do not call tomind any savage race that built such good houses, or such strong andingenious and scientific fortresses, or gave so much attention toagriculture, or had military arts and devices which so nearly approachedthe white man's. These, taken together with their high abilities inboat-building, and their tastes and capacities in the ornamental artsmodify their savagery to a semi-civilization--or at least to,a quarter-civilization.
It is a compliment to them that the British did not exterminate them, asthey did the Australians and the Tasmanians, but were content withsubduing them, and showed no desire to go further. And it is anothercompliment to them that the British did not take the whole of theirchoicest lands, but left them a considerable part, and then went furtherand protected them from the rapacities of landsharks--a protection whichthe New Zealand Government still extends to them. And it is stillanother compliment to the Maoris that the Government allows nativerepresentation--in both the legislature and the cabinet, and gives bothsexes the vote. And in doing these things the Government alsocompliments itself; it has not been the custom of the world forconquerors to act in this large spirit toward the conquered.
The highest class white men Who lived among the Maoris in the earliesttime had a high opinion of them and a strong affection for them. Amongthe whites of this sort was the author of "Old New Zealand;" and Dr.Campbell of Auckland was another. Dr. Campbell was a close friend ofseveral chiefs, and has many pleasant things to say of their fidelity,their magnanimity, and their generosity. Also of their quaint notionsabout the white man's queer civilization, and their equally quaintcomments upon it. One of them thought the missionary had got everythingwrong end first and upside down. "Why, he wants us to stop worshipingand supplicating the evil gods, and go to worshiping and supplicating theGood One! There is no sense in that. A good god is not going to do usany harm."
The Maoris had the tabu; and had it on a Polynesian scale ofcomprehensiveness and elaboration. Some of its features could have beenimportations from India and Judea. Neither the Maori nor the Hindoo ofcommon degree could cook by a fire that a person of higher caste hadused, nor could the high Maori or high Hindoo employ fire that had serveda man of low grade; if a low-grade Maori or Hindoo drank from a vesselbelonging to a high-grade man, the vessel was defiled, and had to bedestroyed. There were other resemblances between Maori tabu and Hindoocaste-custom.
Yesterday a lunatic burst into my quarters and warned me that the Jesuitswere going to "cook" (poison) me in my food, or kill me on the stage atnight. He said a mysterious sign was visible upon my posters and meantmy death. He said he saved Rev. Mr. Haweis's life by warning him thatthere were three men on his platform who would kill him if he took hiseyes off them for a moment during his lecture. The same men were in myaudience last night, but they saw that he was there. "Will they be thereagain to-night?" He hesitated; then said no, he thought they wouldrather take a rest and chance the poison. This lunatic has no delicacy.But he was not uninteresting. He told me a lot of things. He said hehad "saved so many lecturers in twenty years, that they put him in theasylum." I think he has less refinement than any lunatic I have met.
December 8. A couple of curious war-monuments here at Wanganui. One isin honor of white men "who fell in defence of law and order againstfanaticism and barbarism." Fanaticism. We Americans are English inblood, English in speech, English in religion, English in the essentialsof our governmental system, English in the essentials of ourcivilization; and so, let us hope, for the honor of the blend, for thehonor of the blood, for the honor of the race, that that word got therethrough lack of heedfulness, and will not be suffered to remain. If youcarve it at Thermopylae, or where Winkelried died, or upon Bunker Hillmonument, and read it again "who fell in defence of law and order againstfanaticism" you will perceive what the word means, and how mischosen itis. Patriotism is Patriotism. Calling it Fanaticism cannot degrade it;nothing can degrade it. Even though it be a political mistake, and athousand times a political mistake, that does not affect it; it ishonorable always honorable, always noble--and privileged to hold its headup and look the nations in the face. It is right to praise these bravewhite men who fell in the Maori war--they deserve it; but the presence ofthat word detracts from the dignity of their cause and their deeds, andmakes them appear to have spilt their blood in a conflict with ignoblemen, men not worthy of that costly sacrifice. But the men were worthy.It was no shame to fight them. They fought for their homes, they foughtfor their country; they bravely fought and bravely fell; and it wouldtake nothing from the honor of the brave Englishmen who lie under themonument, but add to it, to say that they died in defense of English lawsand English homes against men worthy of the sacrifice--the Maoripatriots.
The other monument cannot be rectified. Except with dynamite. It is amistake all through, and a strangely thoughtless one. It is a monumenterected by white men to Maoris who fell fighting with the whites andagainst their own people, in the Maori war. "Sacred to the memory of thebrave men who fell on the 14th of May, 1864," etc. On one side are thenames of about twenty Maoris. It is not a fancy of mine; the monumentexists. I saw it. It is an object-lesson to the rising generation. Itinvites to treachery, disloyalty, unpatriotism. Its lesson, in frankterms is, "Desert your flag, slay your people, burn their homes, shameyour nationality--we honor such."
December 9. Wellington. Ten hours from Wanganui by the Fly.December 12. It is a fine city and nobly situated. A busy place, andfull of life and movement. Have spent the three days partly in walkingabout, partly in enjoying social privileges, and largely in idling aroundthe magnificent garden at Hutt, a little distance away, around the shore.I suppose we shall not see such another one soon.
We are packing to-night for the return-voyage to Australia. Our stay inNew Zealand has been too brief; still, we are not unthankful for theglimpse which we have had of it.
The sturdy Maoris made the settlement of the country by the whites ratherdifficult. Not at first--but later. At first they welcomed the whites,and were eager to trade with them--particularly for muskets; for theirpastime was internecine war, and they greatly preferred the white man'sweapons to their own. War was their pastime--I use the word advisedly.They often met and slaughtered each other just for a lark, and when therewas no quarrel. The author of "Old New Zealand" mentions a case where avictorious army could have followed up its advantage and exterminated theopposing army, but declined to do it; explaining naively that "if we didthat, there couldn't be any more fighting." In another battle one armysent word that it was out of ammunition, and would be obliged to stopunless the opposing army would send some. It was sent, and the fightwent on.
In the early days things went well enough. The natives sold land withoutclearly understanding the terms of exchange, and the whites bought itwithout being much disturbed about the native's confusion of mind. Butby and by the Maori began to comprehend that he was being wronged; thenthere was trouble, for he was not the man to swallow a wrong and go asideand cry about it. He had the Tasmanian's spirit and endurance, and anotable share of military science besides; and so he rose against theoppressor, did this gallant "fanatic," and started a war that was notbrought to a definite end until more than a generation had sped.
