Prosperity is the best protector of principle. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
EVENING--11th. Sailed in the Rosetta. This is a poor old ship, andought to be insured and sunk. As in the 'Oceana', just so here:everybody dresses for dinner; they make it a sort of pious duty. Thesefine and formal costumes are a rather conspicuous contrast to the povertyand shabbiness of the surroundings . . . . If you want a slice of alime at four o'clock tea, you must sign an order on the bar. Limes cost14 cents a barrel.
January 18th. We have been running up the Arabian Sea, latterly.Closing up on Bombay now, and due to arrive this evening.
January 20th. Bombay! A bewitching place, a bewildering place, anenchanting place--the Arabian Nights come again? It is a vast city;contains about a million inhabitants. Natives, they are, with a slightsprinkling of white people--not enough to have the slightest modifyingeffect upon the massed dark complexion of the public. It is winter here,yet the weather is the divine weather of June, and the foliage is thefresh and heavenly foliage of June. There is a rank of noble great shadetrees across the way from the hotel, and under them sit groups ofpicturesque natives of both sexes; and the juggler in his turban is therewith his snakes and his magic; and all day long the cabs and themultitudinous varieties of costumes flock by. It does not seem as if onecould ever get tired of watching this moving show, this shining andshifting spectacle . . . . In the great bazar the pack and jam ofnatives was marvelous, the sea of rich-colored turbans and draperies aninspiring sight, and the quaint and showy Indian architecture was justthe right setting for it. Toward sunset another show; this is the drivearound the sea-shore to Malabar Point, where Lord Sandhurst, the Governorof the Bombay Presidency, lives. Parsee palaces all along the first partof the drive; and past them all the world is driving; the privatecarriages of wealthy Englishmen and natives of rank are manned by adriver and three footmen in stunning oriental liveries--two of theseturbaned statues standing up behind, as fine as monuments. Sometimeseven the public carriages have this superabundant crew, slightlymodified--one to drive, one to sit by and see it done, and one to standup behind and yell--yell when there is anybody in the way, and forpractice when there isn't. It all helps to keep up the liveliness andaugment the general sense of swiftness and energy and confusion andpow-wow.
In the region of Scandal Point--felicitous name--where there are handyrocks to sit on and a noble view of the sea on the one hand, and on theother the passing and reprising whirl and tumult of gay carriages, aregreat groups of comfortably-off Parsee women--perfect flower-beds ofbrilliant color, a fascinating spectacle. Tramp, tramp, tramping alongthe road, in singles, couples, groups, and gangs, you have theworking-man and the working-woman--but not clothed like ours. Usuallythe man is a nobly-built great athlete, with not a rag on but hisloin-handkerchief; his color a deep dark brown, his skin satin, hisrounded muscles knobbing it as if it had eggs under it. Usually thewoman is a slender and shapely creature, as erect as a lightning-rod, andshe has but one thing on--a bright-colored piece of stuff which is woundabout her head and her body down nearly half-way to her knees, and whichclings like her own skin. Her legs and feet are bare, and so are herarms, except for her fanciful bunches of loose silver rings on her anklesand on her arms. She has jewelry bunched on the side of her nose also,and showy clusterings on her toes. When she undresses for bed she takesoff her jewelry, I suppose. If she took off anything more she wouldcatch cold. As a rule she has a large shiney brass water jar of gracefulshape on her head, and one of her naked arms curves up and the hand holdsit there. She is so straight, so erect, and she steps with such style,and such easy grace and dignity; and her curved arm and her brazen jarare such a help to the picture indeed, our working-women cannot beginwith her as a road-decoration.
It is all color, bewitching color, enchanting color--everywhere allaround--all the way around the curving great opaline bay clear toGovernment House, where the turbaned big native 'chuprassies' standgrouped in state at the door in their robes of fiery red, and do mostproperly and stunningly finish up the splendid show and make ittheatrically complete. I wish I were a 'chuprassy'.
This is indeed India! the land of dreams and romance, of fabulous wealthand fabulous poverty, of splendor and rags, of palaces and hovels, offamine and pestilence, of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps, of tigersand elephants, the cobra and the jungle, the country of a hundred nationsand a hundred tongues, of a thousand religions and two million gods,cradle of the human race, birthplace of human speech, mother of history,grandmother of legend, great-grandmother of tradition, whose yesterdaysbear date with the mouldering antiquities of the rest of the nations--theone sole country under the sun that is endowed with an imperishableinterest for alien prince and alien peasant, for lettered and ignorant,wise and fool, rich and poor, bond and free, the one land that all mendesire to see, and having seen once, by even a glimpse, would not givethat glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the globe combined.Even now, after the lapse of a year, the delirium of those days in Bombayhas not left me, and I hope never will. It was all new, no detail of ithackneyed. And India did not wait for morning, it began at the hotel--straight away. The lobbies and halls were full of turbaned, and fez'dand embroidered, cap'd, and barefooted, and cotton-clad dark natives,some of them rushing about, others at rest squatting, or sitting on theground; some of them chattering with energy, others still and dreamy; inthe dining-room every man's own private native servant standing behindhis chair, and dressed for a part in the Arabian Nights.
Our rooms were high up, on the front. A white man--he was a burly German--went up with us, and brought three natives along to see to arrangingthings. About fourteen others followed in procession, with thehand-baggage; each carried an article--and only one; a bag, in somecases, in other cases less. One strong native carried my overcoat,another a parasol, another a box of cigars, another a novel, and the lastman in the procession had no load but a fan. It was all done withearnestness and sincerity, there was not a smile in the procession fromthe head of it to the tail of it. Each man waited patiently, tranquilly,in no sort of hurry, till one of us found time to give him a copper, thenhe bent his head reverently, touched his forehead with his fingers, andwent his way. They seemed a soft and gentle race, and there wassomething both winning and touching about their demeanor.
There was a vast glazed door which opened upon the balcony. It neededclosing, or cleaning, or something, and a native got down on his kneesand went to work at it. He seemed to be doing it well enough, butperhaps he wasn't, for the burly German put on a look that betrayeddissatisfaction, then without explaining what was wrong, gave the nativea brisk cuff on the jaw and then told him where the defect was. Itseemed such a shame to do that before us all. The native took it withmeekness, saying nothing, and not showing in his face or manner anyresentment. I had not seen the like of this for fifty years. It carriedme back to my boyhood, and flashed upon me the forgotten fact that thiswas the usual way of explaining one's desires to a slave. I was able toremember that the method seemed right and natural to me in those days, Ibeing born to it and unaware that elsewhere there were other methods; butI was also able to remember that those unresented cuffings made me sorryfor the victim and ashamed for the punisher. My father was a refined andkindly gentleman, very grave, rather austere, of rigid probity, a sternlyjust and upright man, albeit he attended no church and never spoke ofreligious matters, and had no part nor lot in the pious joys of hisPresbyterian family, nor ever seemed to suffer from this deprivation. Helaid his hand upon me in punishment only twice in his life, and then notheavily; once for telling him a lie--which surprised me, and showed mehow unsuspicious he was, for that was not my maiden effort. He punishedme those two times only, and never any other member of the family at all;yet every now and then he cuffed our harmless slave boy, Lewis, fortrifling little blunders and awkwardnesses. My father had passed his lifeamong the slaves from his cradle up, and his cuffings proceeded from thecustom of the time, not from his nature. When I was ten years old I sawa man fling a lump of iron-ore at a slaveman in anger, for merely doingsomething awkwardly--as if that were a crime. It bounded from the man'sskull, and the man fell and never spoke again. He was dead in an hour.I knew the man had a right to kill his slave if he wanted to, and yet itseemed a pitiful thing and somehow wrong, though why wrong I was not deepenough to explain if I had been asked to do it. Nobody in the villageapproved of that murder, but of course no one said much about it.
It is curious--the space-annihilating power of thought. For just onesecond, all that goes to make the me in me was in a Missourian village,on the other side of the globe, vividly seeing again these forgottenpictures of fifty years ago, and wholly unconscious of all things butjust those; and in the next second I was back in Bombay, and thatkneeling native's smitten cheek was not done tingling yet! Back toboyhood--fifty years; back to age again, another fifty; and a flightequal to the circumference of the globe-all in two seconds by the watch!
Some natives--I don't remember how many--went into my bedroom, now, andput things to rights and arranged the mosquito-bar, and I went to bed tonurse my cough. It was about nine in the evening. What a state ofthings! For three hours the yelling and shouting of natives in the hallcontinued, along with the velvety patter of their swift bare feet--what aracket it was! They were yelling orders and messages down three flights.Why, in the matter of noise it amounted to a riot, an insurrection, arevolution. And then there were other noises mixed up with these and atintervals tremendously accenting them--roofs falling in, I judged,windows smashing, persons being murdered, crows squawking, and deriding,and cursing, canaries screeching, monkeys jabbering, macaws blaspheming,and every now and then fiendish bursts of laughter and explosions ofdynamite. By midnight I had suffered all the different kinds of shocksthere are, and knew that I could never more be disturbed by them, eitherisolated or in combination. Then came peace--stillness deep and solemnand lasted till five.
Then it all broke loose again. And who re-started it? The Bird of Birdsthe Indian crow. I came to know him well, by and by, and be infatuatedwith him. I suppose he is the hardest lot that wears feathers. Yes, andthe cheerfulest, and the best satisfied with himself. He never arrivedat what he is by any careless process, or any sudden one; he is a work ofart, and "art is long"; he is the product of immemorial ages, and of deepcalculation; one can't make a bird like that in a day. He has beenreincarnated more times than Shiva; and he has kept a sample of eachincarnation, and fused it into his constitution. In the course of hisevolutionary promotions, his sublime march toward ultimate perfection, hehas been a gambler, a low comedian, a dissolute priest, a fussy woman, ablackguard, a scoffer, a liar, a thief, a spy, an informer, a tradingpolitician, a swindler, a professional hypocrite, a patriot for cash, areformer, a lecturer, a lawyer, a conspirator, a rebel, a royalist, ademocrat, a practicer and propagator of irreverence, a meddler, anintruder, a busybody, an infidel, and a wallower in sin for the mere loveof it. The strange result, the incredible result, of this patientaccumulation of all damnable traits is, that he does not know what careis, he does not know what sorrow is, he does not know what remorse is,his life is one long thundering ecstasy of happiness, and he will go tohis death untroubled, knowing that he will soon turn up again as anauthor or something, and be even more intolerably capable and comfortablethan ever he was before.
In his straddling wide forward-step, and his springy side-wise series ofhops, and his impudent air, and his cunning way of canting his head toone side upon occasion, he reminds one of the American blackbird. Butthe sharp resemblances stop there. He is much bigger than the blackbird;and he lacks the blackbird's trim and slender and beautiful build andshapely beak; and of course his sober garb of gray and rusty black is apoor and humble thing compared with the splendid lustre of theblackbird's metallic sables and shifting and flashing bronze glories.The blackbird is a perfect gentleman, in deportment and attire, and isnot noisy, I believe, except when holding religious services andpolitical conventions in a tree; but this Indian sham Quaker is just arowdy, and is always noisy when awake--always chaffing, scolding,scoffing, laughing, ripping, and cursing, and carrying on about somethingor other. I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions. Nothingescapes him; he notices everything that happens, and brings out hisopinion about it, particularly if it is a matter that is none of hisbusiness. And it is never a mild opinion, but always violent--violentand profane--the presence of ladies does not affect him. His opinionsare not the outcome of reflection, for he never thinks about anything,but heaves out the opinion that is on top in his mind, and which is oftenan opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit the case.But that is his way; his main idea is to get out an opinion, and if hestopped to think he would lose chances.
I suppose he has no enemies among men. The whites and Mohammedans neverseemed to molest him; and the Hindoos, because of their religion, nevertake the life of any creature, but spare even the snakes and tigers andfleas and rats. If I sat on one end of the balcony, the crows wouldgather on the railing at the other end and talk about me; and edgecloser, little by little, till I could almost reach them; and they wouldsit there, in the most unabashed way, and talk about my clothes, and myhair, and my complexion, and probable character and vocation andpolitics, and how I came to be in India, and what I had been doing, andhow many days I had got for it, and how I had happened to go unhangedso long, and when would it probably come off, and might there be more ofmy sort where I came from, and when would they be hanged,--and so on, andso on, until I could not longer endure the embarrassment of it; then Iwould shoo them away, and they would circle around in the air a littlewhile, laughing and deriding and mocking, and presently settle on therail and do it all over again.
They were very sociable when there was anything to eat--oppressively so.With a little encouragement they would come in and light on the table andhelp me eat my breakfast; and once when I was in the other room and theyfound themselves alone, they carried off everything they could lift; andthey were particular to choose things which they could make no use ofafter they got them. In India their number is beyond estimate, and theirnoise is in proportion. I suppose they cost the country more than thegovernment does; yet that is not a light matter. Still, they pay; theircompany pays; it would sadden the land to take their cheerful voice outof it.
