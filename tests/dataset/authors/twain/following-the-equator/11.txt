We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that isin it--and stop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hotstove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again--and that iswell; but also she will never sit down on a cold one any more. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
All English-speaking colonies are made up of lavishly hospitable people,and New South Wales and its capital are like the rest in this. TheEnglish-speaking colony of the United States of America is alwayscalled lavishly hospitable by the English traveler. As to the otherEnglish-speaking colonies throughout the world from Canada all around, Iknow by experience that the description fits them. I will not go moreparticularly into this matter, for I find that when writers try todistribute their gratitude here and there and yonder by detail they runacross difficulties and do some ungraceful stumbling.
Mr. Gane ("New South Wales and Victoria in 1885 "), tried to distributehis gratitude, and was not lucky:
 "The inhabitants of Sydney are renowned for their hospitality. The treatment which we experienced at the hands of this generous-hearted people will help more than anything else to make us recollect with pleasure our stay amongst them. In the character of hosts and hostesses they excel. The 'new chum' needs only the acquaintanceship of one of their number, and he becomes at once the happy recipient of numerous complimentary invitations and thoughtful kindnesses. Of the towns it has been our good fortune to visit, none have portrayed home so faithfully as Sydney."
Nobody could say it finer than that. If he had put in his cork then, andstayed away from Dubbo----but no; heedless man, he pulled it again.Pulled it when he was away along in his book, and his memory of what hehad said about Sydney had grown dim:
 "We cannot quit the promising town of Dubbo without testifying, in warm praise, to the kind-hearted and hospitable usages of its inhabitants. Sydney, though well deserving the character it bears of its kindly treatment of strangers, possesses a little formality and reserve. In Dubbo, on the contrary, though the same congenial manners prevail, there is a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity which gives the town a homely comfort not often met with elsewhere. In laying on one side our pen we feel contented in having been able, though so late in this work, to bestow a panegyric, however unpretentious, on a town which, though possessing no picturesque natural surroundings, nor interesting architectural productions, has yet a body of citizens whose hearts cannot but obtain for their town a reputation for benevolence and kind-heartedness."
I wonder what soured him on Sydney. It seems strange that a pleasingdegree of three or four fingers of respectful familiarity should fill aman up and give him the panegyrics so bad. For he has them, the worstway--any one can see that. A man who is perfectly at himself does notthrow cold detraction at people's architectural productions andpicturesque surroundings, and let on that what he prefers is a Dubbonesedust-storm and a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity, No, these areold, old symptoms; and when they appear we know that the man has got thepanegyrics.
Sydney has a population of 400,000. When a stranger from America stepsashore there, the first thing that strikes him is that the place is eightor nine times as large as he was expecting it to be; and the next thingthat strikes him is that it is an English city with American trimmings.Later on, in Melbourne, he will find the American trimmings still more inevidence; there, even the architecture will often suggest America; aphotograph of its stateliest business street might be passed upon him fora picture of the finest street in a large American city. I was told thatthe most of the fine residences were the city residences of squatters.The name seemed out of focus somehow. When the explanation came, itoffered a new instance of the curious changes which words, as well asanimals, undergo through change of habitat and climate. With us, whenyou speak of a squatter you are always supposed to be speaking of a poorman, but in Australia when you speak of a squatter you are supposed to bespeaking of a millionaire; in America the word indicates the possessor ofa few acres and a doubtful title, in Australia it indicates a man whoselandfront is as long as a railroad, and whose title has been perfected inone way or another; in America the word indicates a man who owns a dozenhead of live stock, in Australia a man who owns anywhere from fiftythousand up to half a million head; in America the word indicates a manwho is obscure and not important, in Australia a man who is prominent andof the first importance; in America you take off your hat to no squatter,in Australia you do; in America if your uncle is a squatter you keep itdark, in Australia you advertise it; in America if your friend is asquatter nothing comes of it, but with a squatter for your friend inAustralia you may sup with kings if there are any around.
In Australia it takes about two acres and a half of pastureland (somepeople say twice as many), to support a sheep; and when the squatter hashalf a million sheep his private domain is about as large as RhodeIsland, to speak in general terms. His annual wool crop may be worth aquarter or a half million dollars.
He will live in a palace in Melbourne or Sydney or some other of thelarge cities, and make occasional trips to his sheep-kingdom severalhundred miles away in the great plains to look after his battalions ofriders and shepherds and other hands. He has a commodious dwelling outthere, and if he approve of you he will invite you to spend a week in it,and will make you at home and comfortable, and let you see the greatindustry in all its details, and feed you and slake you and smoke youwith the best that money can buy.
On at least one of these vast estates there is a considerable town, withall the various businesses and occupations that go to make an importanttown; and the town and the land it stands upon are the property of thesquatters. I have seen that town, and it is not unlikely that there areother squatter-owned towns in Australia.
Australia supplies the world not only with fine wool, but with muttonalso. The modern invention of cold storage and its application in shipshas created this great trade. In Sydney I visited a huge establishmentwhere they kill and clean and solidly freeze a thousand sheep a day, forshipment to England.
The Australians did not seem to me to differ noticeably from Americans,either in dress, carriage, ways, pronunciation, inflections, or generalappearance. There were fleeting and subtle suggestions of their Englishorigin, but these were not pronounced enough, as a rule, to catch one'sattention. The people have easy and cordial manners from the beginning--from the moment that the introduction is completed. This is American.To put it in another way, it is English friendliness with the Englishshyness and self-consciousness left out.
Now and then--but this is rare--one hears such words as piper for paper,lydy for lady, and tyble for table fall from lips whence one would notexpect such pronunciations to come. There is a superstition prevalent inSydney that this pronunciation is an Australianism, but people who havebeen "home"--as the native reverently and lovingly calls England--knowbetter. It is "costermonger." All over Australasia this pronunciationis nearly as common among servants as it is in London among theuneducated and the partially educated of all sorts and conditions ofpeople. That mislaid 'y' is rather striking when a person gets enough ofit into a short sentence to enable it to show up. In the hotel in Sydneythe chambermaid said, one morning:
"The tyble is set, and here is the piper; and if the lydy is ready I'lltell the wyter to bring up the breakfast."
I have made passing mention, a moment ago, of the native Australasian'scustom of speaking of England as "home." It was always pretty to hearit, and often it was said in an unconsciously caressing way that made ittouching; in a way which transmuted a sentiment into an embodiment, andmade one seem to see Australasia as a young girl stroking motherEngland's old gray head.
In the Australasian home the table-talk is vivacious and unembarrassed;it is without stiffness or restraint. This does not remind one ofEngland so much as it does of America. But Australasia is strictlydemocratic, and reserves and restraints are things that are bred bydifferences of rank.
English and colonial audiences are phenomenally alert and responsive.Where masses of people are gathered together in England, caste issubmerged, and with it the English reserve; equality exists for themoment, and every individual is free; so free from any consciousness offetters, indeed, that the Englishman's habit of watching himself andguarding himself against any injudicious exposure of his feelings isforgotten, and falls into abeyance--and to such a degree indeed, that hewill bravely applaud all by himself if he wants to--an exhibition ofdaring which is unusual elsewhere in the world.
But it is hard to move a new English acquaintance when he is by himself,or when the company present is small and new to him. He is on his guardthen, and his natural reserve is to the fore. This has given him thefalse reputation of being without humor and without the appreciation ofhumor.
Americans are not Englishmen, and American humor is not English humor;but both the American and his humor had their origin in England, and havemerely undergone changes brought about by changed conditions and a newenvironment. About the best humorous speeches I have yet heard were acouple that were made in Australia at club suppers--one of them by anEnglishman, the other by an Australian.
