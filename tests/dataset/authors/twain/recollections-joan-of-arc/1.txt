BOOK I IN DOMREMY
Chapter 1 When Wolves Ran Free in Paris
I, THE SIEUR LOUIS DE CONTE, was born in Neufchateau, on the 6th ofJanuary, 1410; that is to say, exactly two years before Joan of Arc wasborn in Domremy. My family had fled to those distant regions from theneighborhood of Paris in the first years of the century. In politicsthey were Armagnacs--patriots; they were for our own French King, crazyand impotent as he was. The Burgundian party, who were for the English,had stripped them, and done it well. They took everything but myfather's small nobility, and when he reached Neufchateau he reached itin poverty and with a broken spirit. But the political atmosphere therewas the sort he liked, and that was something. He came to a region ofcomparative quiet; he left behind him a region peopled with furies,madmen, devils, where slaughter was a daily pastime and no man's lifesafe for a moment. In Paris, mobs roared through the streets nightly,sacking, burning, killing, unmolested, uninterrupted. The sun rose uponwrecked and smoking buildings, and upon mutilated corpses lying here,there, and yonder about the streets, just as they fell, and strippednaked by thieves, the unholy gleaners after the mob. None had thecourage to gather these dead for burial; they were left there to rot andcreate plagues.
And plagues they did create. Epidemics swept away the people like flies,and the burials were conducted secretly and by night, for publicfunerals were not allowed, lest the revelation of the magnitude of theplague's work unman the people and plunge them into despair. Then came,finally, the bitterest winter which had visited France in five hundredyears. Famine, pestilence, slaughter, ice, snow--Paris had all these atonce. The dead lay in heaps about the streets, and wolves entered thecity in daylight and devoured them.
Ah, France had fallen low--so low! For more than three quarters of acentury the English fangs had been bedded in her flesh, and so cowed hadher armies become by ceaseless rout and defeat that it was said andaccepted that the mere sight of an English army was sufficient to put aFrench one to flight.
When I was five years old the prodigious disaster of Agincourt fell uponFrance; and although the English King went home to enjoy his glory, heleft the country prostrate and a prey to roving bands of Free Companionsin the service of the Burgundian party, and one of these bands cameraiding through Neufchateau one night, and by the light of our burningroof-thatch I saw all that were dear to me in this world (save an elderbrother, your ancestor, left behind with the court) butchered while theybegged for mercy, and heard the butchers laugh at their prayers andmimic their pleadings. I was overlooked, and escaped without hurt. Whenthe savages were gone I crept out and cried the night away watching theburning houses; and I was all alone, except for the company of the deadand the wounded, for the rest had taken flight and hidden themselves.
I was sent to Domremy, to the priest, whose housekeeper became a lovingmother to me. The priest, in the course of time, taught me to read andwrite, and he and I were the only persons in the village who possessedthis learning.
At the time that the house of this good priest, Guillaume Fronte, becamemy home, I was six years old. We lived close by the village church, andthe small garden of Joan's parents was behind the church. As to thatfamily there were Jacques d'Arc the father, his wife Isabel Romee; threesons--Jacques, ten years old, Pierre, eight, and Jean, seven; Joan,four, and her baby sister Catherine, about a year old. I had thesechildren for playmates from the beginning. I had some other playmatesbesides--particularly four boys: Pierre Morel, Etienne Roze, NoelRainguesson, and Edmond Aubrey, whose father was maire at that time;also two girls, about Joan's age, who by and by became her favorites;one was named Haumetter, the other was called Little Mengette. Thesegirls were common peasant children, like Joan herself. When they grewup, both married common laborers. Their estate was lowly enough, yousee; yet a time came, many years after, when no passing stranger,howsoever great he might be, failed to go and pay his reverence to thoseto humble old women who had been honored in their youth by thefriendship of Joan of Arc.
These were all good children, just of the ordinary peasant type; notbright, of course--you would not expect that--but good-hearted andcompanionable, obedient to their parents and the priest; and as theygrew up they became properly stocked with narrowness and prejudices gotat second hand from their elders, and adopted without reserve; andwithout examination also--which goes without saying. Their religion wasinherited, their politics the same. John Huss and his sort might findfault with the Church, in Domremy it disturbed nobody's faith; and whenthe split came, when I was fourteen, and we had three Popes at once,nobody in Domremy was worried about how to choose among them--the Popeof Rome was the right one, a Pope outside of Rome was no Pope at all.Every human creature in the village was an Armagnac--a patriot--and ifwe children hotly hated nothing else in the world, we did certainly hatethe English and Burgundian name and polity in that way.
