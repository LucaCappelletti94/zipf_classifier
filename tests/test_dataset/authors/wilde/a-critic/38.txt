(THIRD SERIES)

(Pall Mall Gazette, June 27, 1889.)


Mr. Swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very perfect and
very poisonous poetry. Then he became revolutionary and pantheistic, and
cried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and on
earth. Then he invented Marie Stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden
of Bothwell. Then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems about
children of a somewhat over-subtle character. He is now extremely
patriotic, and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affection
for the Tory party. He has always been a great poet. But he has his
limitations, the chief of which is, curiously enough, the entire lack of
any sense of limit. His song is nearly always too loud for his subject.
His magnificent rhetoric, nowhere more magnificent than in the volume
that now lies before us, conceals rather than reveals. It has been said
of him, and with truth, that he is a master of language, but with still
greater truth it may be said that Language is his master. Words seem to
dominate him. Alliteration tyrannizes over him. Mere sound often
becomes his lord. He is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomes
unreal.
Let us turn to the poem on the Armada:

    The wings of the south-west wind are widened; the breath of his
    fervent lips,
    More keen than a sword's edge, fiercer than fire, falls full on the
    plunging ships.
    The pilot is he of the northward flight, their stay and their
    steersman he;
    A helmsman clothed with the tempest, and girdled with strength to
    constrain the sea.
    And the host of them trembles and quails, caught fast in his hand as
    a bird in the toils:
    For the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than man's,
    whom he slays and spoils.
    And vainly, with heart divided in sunder, and labour of wavering
    will,
    The lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star
    shine still.


Somehow we seem to have heard all this before. Does it come from the
fact that of all the poets who ever lived Mr. Swinburne is the one who is
the most limited in imagery? It must be admitted that he is so. He has
wearied us with his monotony. 'Fire' and the 'Sea' are the two words
ever on his lips. We must confess also that this shrill
singing--marvellous as it is--leaves us out of breath. Here is a passage
from a poem called A Word with the Wind:

    Be the sunshine bared or veiled, the sky superb or shrouded,
       Still the waters, lax and languid, chafed and foiled,
    Keen and thwarted, pale and patient, clothed with fire or clouded,
       Vex their heart in vain, or sleep like serpents coiled.
    Thee they look for, blind and baffled, wan with wrath and weary,
       Blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird:
    Winds that seamews breast subdue the sea, and bid the dreary
       Waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred.
    Let the clarion sound from westward, let the south bear token
       How the glories of thy godhead sound and shine:
    Bid the land rejoice to see the land-wind's broad wings broken,
       Bid the sea take comfort, bid the world be thine.

Verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength and
vigour of its metrical scheme. Its purely technical excellence is
extraordinary. But is it more than an oratorical tour de force? Does
it really convey much? Does it charm? Could we return to it again and
again with renewed pleasure? We think not. It seems to us empty.
Of course, we must not look to these poems for any revelation of human
life. To be at one with the elements seems to be Mr. Swinburne's aim.
He seeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave. The roar of the fire
is ever in his ears. He puts his clarion to the lips of Spring and bids
her blow, and the Earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret.
He is the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender of
his own personality, and he has succeeded. We hear the song, but we
never know the singer. We never even get near to him. Out of the
thunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing. We have often
had man's interpretation of Nature; now we have Nature's interpretation
of man, and she has curiously little to say. Force and Freedom form her
vague message. She deafens us with her clangours.
But Mr. Swinburne is not always riding the whirlwind and calling out of
the depths of the sea. Romantic ballads in Border dialect have not lost
their fascination for him, and this last volume contains some very
splendid examples of this curious artificial kind of poetry. The amount
of pleasure one gets out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament.
To say 'mither' instead of 'mother' seems to many the acme of romance.
There are others who are not quite so ready to believe in the pathos of
provincialism. There is, however, no doubt of Mr. Swinburne's mastery
over the form, whether the form be quite legitimate or not. The Weary
Wedding has the concentration and colour of a great drama, and the
quaintness of its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque.
The ballad of The Witch-Mother, a mediaeval Medea who slays her
children because her lord is faithless, is worth reading on account of
its horrible simplicity. The Bride's Tragedy, with its strange refrain
of

    In, in, out and in,
    Blaws the wind and whirls the whin:
The Jacobite's Exile--
    O lordly flow the Loire and Seine,
       And loud the dark Durance:
    But bonnier shine the braes of Tyne
       Than a' the fields of France;
    And the waves of Till that speak sae still
       Gleam goodlier where they glance:


The Tyneside Widow and A Reiver's Neck-verse are all poems of fine
imaginative power, and some of them are terrible in their fierce
intensity of passion. There is no danger of English poetry narrowing
itself to a form so limited as the romantic ballad in dialect. It is of
too vital a growth for that. So we may welcome Mr. Swinburne's masterly
experiments with the hope that things which are inimitable will not be
imitated. The collection is completed by a few poems on children, some
sonnets, a threnody on John William Inchbold, and a lovely lyric entitled
The Interpreters.
    In human thought have all things habitation;
             Our days
    Laugh, lower, and lighten past, and find no station
             That stays.
    But thought and faith are mightier things than time
             Can wrong,
    Made splendid once by speech, or made sublime
             By song.
    Remembrance, though the tide of change that rolls
             Wax hoary,
    Gives earth and heaven, for song's sake and the soul's,
             Their glory.


Certainly, 'for song's sake' we should love Mr. Swinburne's work, cannot,
indeed, help loving it, so marvellous a music-maker is he. But what of
the soul? For the soul we must go elsewhere.
