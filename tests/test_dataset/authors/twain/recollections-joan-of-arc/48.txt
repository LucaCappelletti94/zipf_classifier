Treachery Conquers Joan
COURIER after courier was despatched to the King, and he promised tocome, but didn't. The Duke d'Alencon went to him and got his promiseagain, which he broke again. Nine days were lost thus; then he came,arriving at St. Denis September 7th.
Meantime the enemy had begun to take heart: the spiritless conduct of theKing could have no other result. Preparations had now been made to defendthe city. Joan's chances had been diminished, but she and her generalsconsidered them plenty good enough yet. Joan ordered the attack for eighto'clock next morning, and at that hour it began.
Joan placed her artillery and began to pound a strong work whichprotected the gate St. HonorÂ‚. When it was sufficiently crippled theassault was sounded at noon, and it was carried by storm. Then we movedforward to storm the gate itself, and hurled ourselves against it againand again, Joan in the lead with her standard at her side, the smokeenveloping us in choking clouds, and the missiles flying over us andthrough us as thick as hail.
In the midst of our last assault, which would have carried the gate sureand given us Paris and in effect France, Joan was struck down by acrossbow bolt, and our men fell back instantly and almost in a panic--forwhat were they without her? She was the army, herself.
Although disabled, she refused to retire, and begged that a new assaultbe made, saying it must win; and adding, with the battle-light rising inher eyes, "I will take Paris now or die!" She had to be carried away byforce, and this was done by Gaucourt and the Duke d'Alencon.
But her spirits were at the very top notch, now. She was brimming withenthusiasm. She said she would be carried before the gate in the morning,and in half an hour Paris would be ours without any question. She couldhave kept her word. About this there was no doubt. But she forgot onefactor--the King, shadow of that substance named La Tremouille. The Kingforbade the attempt!
You see, a new Embassy had just come from the Duke of Burgundy, andanother sham private trade of some sort was on foot.
You would know, without my telling you, that Joan's heart was nearlybroken. Because of the pain of her wound and the pain at her heart sheslept little that night. Several times the watchers heard muffled sobsfrom the dark room where she lay at St. Denis, and many times thegrieving words, "It could have been taken!--it could have been taken!"which were the only ones she said.
She dragged herself out of bed a day later with a new hope. D'Alencon hadthrown a bridge across the Seine near St. Denis. Might she not cross bythat and assault Paris at another point? But the King got wind of it andbroke the bridge down! And more--he declared the campaign ended! And morestill--he had made a new truce and a long one, in which he had agreed toleave Paris unthreatened and unmolested, and go back to the Loire whencehe had come!
Joan of Arc, who had never been defeated by the enemy, was defeated byher own King. She had said once that all she feared for her cause wastreachery. It had struck its first blow now. She hung up her white armorin the royal basilica of St. Denis, and went and asked the King torelieve her of her functions and let her go home. As usual, she was wise.Grand combinations, far-reaching great military moves were at an end,now; for the future, when the truce should end, the war would be merely awar of random and idle skirmishes, apparently; work suitable forsubalterns, and not requiring the supervision of a sublime militarygenius. But the King would not let her go. The truce did not embrace allFrance; there were French strongholds to be watched and preserved; hewould need her. Really, you see, Tremouille wanted to keep her where hecould balk and hinder her.
Now came her Voices again. They said, "Remain at St. Denis." There was noexplanation. They did not say why. That was the voice of God; it tookprecedence of the command of the King; Joan resolved to stay. But thatfilled La Tremouille with dread. She was too tremendous a force to beleft to herself; she would surely defeat all his plans. He beguiled theKing to use compulsion. Joan had to submit--because she was wounded andhelpless. In the Great Trial she said she was carried away against herwill; and that if she had not been wounded it could not have beenaccomplished. Ah, she had a spirit, that slender girl! a spirit to braveall earthly powers and defy them. We shall never know why the Voicesordered her to stay. We only know this; that if she could have obeyed,the history of France would not be as it now stands written in the books.Yes, well we know that.
On the 13th of September the army, sad and spiritless, turned its facetoward the Loire, and marched--without music! Yes, one noted that detail.It was a funeral march; that is what it was. A long, dreary funeralmarch, with never a shout or a cheer; friends looking on in tears, allthe way, enemies laughing. We reached Gien at last--that place whence wehad set out on our splendid march toward Rheims less than three monthsbefore, with flags flying, bands playing, the victory-flush of Patayglowing in our faces, and the massed multitudes shouting and praising andgiving us godspeed. There was a dull rain falling now, the day was dark,the heavens mourned, the spectators were few, we had no welcome but thewelcome of silence, and pity, and tears.
Then the King disbanded that noble army of heroes; it furled its flags,it stored its arms: the disgrace of France was complete. La Tremouillewore the victor's crown; Joan of Arc, the unconquerable, was conquered.
