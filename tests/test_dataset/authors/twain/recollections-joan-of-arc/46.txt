The King Cries "Forward!"
IN MY double quality of page and secretary I followed Joan to thecouncil. She entered that presence with the bearing of a grieved goddess.What was become of the volatile child that so lately was enchanted with aribbon and suffocated with laughter over the distress of a foolishpeasant who had stormed a funeral on the back of a bee-stung bull? Onemay not guess. Simply it was gone, and had left no sign. She movedstraight to the council-table, and stood. Her glance swept from face toface there, and where it fell, these lit it as with a torch, those itscorched as with a brand. She knew where to strike. She indicated thegenerals with a nod, and said:
"My business is not with you. You have not craved a council of war." Thenshe turned toward the King's privy council, and continued: "No; it iswith you. A council of war! It is amazing. There is but one thing to do,and only one, and lo, ye call a council of war! Councils of war have novalue but to decide between two or several doubtful courses. But acouncil of war when there is only one course? Conceive of a man in a boatand his family in the water, and he goes out among his friends to askwhat he would better do? A council of war, name of God! To determinewhat?"
She stopped, and turned till her eyes rested upon the face of LaTremouille; and so she stood, silent, measuring him, the excitement inall faces burning steadily higher and higher, and all pulses beatingfaster and faster; then she said, with deliberation:
"Every sane man--whose loyalty is to his King and not a show and apretense--knows that there is but one rational thing before us--the marchupon Paris!"
Down came the fist of La Hire with an approving crash upon the table. LaTremouille turned white with anger, but he pulled himself firmly togetherand held his peace. The King's lazy blood was stirred and his eye kindledfinely, for the spirit of war was away down in him somewhere, and afrank, bold speech always found it and made it tingle gladsomely. Joanwaited to see if the chief minister might wish to defend his position;but he was experienced and wise, and not a man to waste his forces wherethe current was against him. He would wait; the King's private ear wouldbe at his disposal by and by.
That pious fox the Chancellor of France took the word now. He washed hissoft hands together, smiling persuasively, and said to Joan:
"Would it be courteous, your Excellency, to move abruptly from herewithout waiting for an answer from the Duke of Burgundy? You may not knowthat we are negotiating with his Highness, and that there is likely to bea fortnight's truce between us; and on his part a pledge to deliver Parisinto our hands without the cost of a blow or the fatigue of a marchthither."
Joan turned to him and said, gravely:
"This is not a confessional, my lord. You were not obliged to expose thatshame here."
The Chancellor's face reddened, and he retorted:
"Shame? What is there shameful about it?"
Joan answered in level, passionless tones:
"One may describe it without hunting far for words. I knew of this poorcomedy, my lord, although it was not intended that I should know. It isto the credit of the devisers of it that they tried to conceal it--thiscomedy whose text and impulse are describable in two words."
The Chancellor spoke up with a fine irony in his manner:
"Indeed? And will your Excellency be good enough to utter them?"
"Cowardice and treachery!"
The fists of all the generals came down this time, and again the King'seye sparkled with pleasure. The Chancellor sprang to his feet andappealed to his Majesty:
"Sire, I claim your protection."
But the King waved him to his seat again, saying:
"Peace. She had a right to be consulted before that thing was undertaken,since it concerned war as well as politics. It is but just that she beheard upon it now."
The Chancellor sat down trembling with indignation, and remarked to Joan:
"Out of charity I will consider that you did not know who devised thismeasure which you condemn in so candid language."
"Save your charity for another occasion, my lord," said Joan, as calmlyas before. "Whenever anything is done to injure the interests and degradethe honor of France, all but the dead know how to name the twoconspirators-in-chief--"
"Sir, sire! this insinuation--"
"It is not an insinuation, my lord," said Joan, placidly, "it is acharge. I bring it against the King's chief minister and his Chancellor."
Both men were on their feet now, insisting that the King modify Joan'sfrankness; but he was not minded to do it. His ordinary councils werestale water--his spirit was drinking wine, now, and the taste of it wasgood. He said:
"Sit--and be patient. What is fair for one must in fairness be allowedthe other. Consider--and be just. When have you two spared her? What darkcharges and harsh names have you withheld when you spoke of her?" Then headded, with a veiled twinkle in his eyes, "If these are offenses I see noparticular difference between them, except that she says her hard thingsto your faces, whereas you say yours behind her back."
He was pleased with that neat shot and the way it shriveled those twopeople up, and made La Hire laugh out loud and the other generals softlyquake and chuckle. Joan tranquilly resumed:
"From the first, we have been hindered by this policy of shilly-shally;this fashion of counseling and counseling and counseling where nocounseling is needed, but only fighting. We took Orleans on the 8th ofMay, and could have cleared the region round about in three days andsaved the slaughter of Patay. We could have been in Rheims six weeks ago,and in Paris now; and would see the last Englishman pass out of France inhalf a year. But we struck no blow after Orleans, but went off into thecountry--what for? Ostensibly to hold councils; really to give Bedfordtime to send reinforcements to Talbot--which he did; and Patay had to befought. After Patay, more counseling, more waste of precious time. Oh, myKing, I would that you would be persuaded!" She began to warm up, now."Once more we have our opportunity. If we rise and strike, all is well.Bid me march upon Paris. In twenty days it shall be yours, and in sixmonths all France! Here is half a year's work before us; if this chancebe wasted, I give you twenty years to do it in. Speak the word, O gentleKing--speak but the one--"
"I cry you mercy!" interrupted the Chancellor, who saw a dangerousenthusiasm rising in the King's face. "March upon Paris? Does yourExcellency forget that the way bristles with English strongholds?"
"That for your English strongholds!" and Joan snapped her fingersscornfully. "Whence have we marched in these last days? From Gien. Andwhither? To Rheims. What bristled between? English strongholds. What arethey now? French ones--and they never cost a blow!" Here applause brokeout from the group of generals, and Joan had to pause a moment to let itsubside. "Yes, English strongholds bristled before us; now French onesbristle behind us. What is the argument? A child can read it. Thestrongholds between us and Paris are garrisoned by no new breed ofEnglish, but by the same breed as those others--with the same fears, thesame questionings, the same weaknesses, the same disposition to see theheavy hand of God descending upon them. We have but to march!--on theinstant--and they are ours, Paris is ours, France is ours! Give the word,O my King, command your servant to--"
"Stay!" cried the Chancellor. "It would be madness to put our affrontupon his Highness the Duke of Burgundy. By the treaty which we have everyhope to make with him--"
"Oh, the treaty which we hope to make with him! He has scorned you foryears, and defied you. Is it your subtle persuasions that have softenedhis manners and beguiled him to listen to proposals? No; it wasblows!--the blows which we gave him! That is the only teaching that thatsturdy rebel can understand. What does he care for wind? The treaty whichwe hope to make with him--alack! He deliver Paris! There is no pauper inthe land that is less able to do it. He deliver Paris! Ah, but that wouldmake great Bedford smile! Oh, the pitiful pretext! the blind can see thatthis thin pour-parler with its fifteen-day truce has no purpose but togive Bedford time to hurry forward his forces against us. Moretreachery--always treachery! We call a council of war--with nothing tocouncil about; but Bedford calls no council to teach him what our courseis. He knows what he would do in our place. He would hang his traitorsand march upon Paris! O gentle King, rouse! The way is open, Parisbeckons, France implores, Speak and we--"
"Sire, it is madness, sheer madness! Your Excellency, we cannot, we mustnot go back from what we have done; we have proposed to treat, we musttreat with the Duke of Burgundy."
"And we will!" said Joan.
"Ah? How?"
"At the point of the lance!"
The house rose, to a man--all that had French hearts--and let go a crackof applause--and kept it up; and in the midst of it one heard La Hiregrowl out: "At the point of the lance! By God, that is music!" The Kingwas up, too, and drew his sword, and took it by the blade and strode toJoan and delivered the hilt of it into her hand, saying:
"There, the King surrenders. Carry it to Paris."
And so the applause burst out again, and the historical council of warthat has bred so many legends was over.
