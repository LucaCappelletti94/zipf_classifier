The Paladin Groans and Boasts
WE WERE twenty-five strong, and well equipped. We rode in double file,Joan and her brothers in the center of the column, with Jean de Metz atthe head of it and the Sieur Bertrand at its extreme rear. In two orthree hours we should be in the enemy's country, and then none wouldventure to desert. By and by we began to hear groans and sobs andexecrations from different points along the line, and upon inquiry foundthat six of our men were peasants who had never ridden a horse before,and were finding it very difficult to stay in their saddles, and moreoverwere now beginning to suffer considerable bodily torture. They had beenseized by the governor at the last moment and pressed into the service tomake up the tale, and he had placed a veteran alongside of each withorders to help him stick to the saddle, and kill him if he tried todesert.
These poor devils had kept quiet as long as they could, but theirphysical miseries were become so sharp by this time that they wereobliged to give them vent. But we were within the enemy's country now, sothere was no help for them, they must continue the march, though Joansaid that if they chose to take the risk they might depart. Theypreferred to stay with us. We modified our pace now, and movedcautiously, and the new men were warned to keep their sorrows tothemselves and not get the command into danger with their curses andlamentations.
Toward dawn we rode deep into a forest, and soon all but the sentrieswere sound asleep in spite of the cold ground and the frosty air.
I woke at noon out of such a solid and stupefying sleep that at first mywits were all astray, and I did not know where I was nor what had beenhappening. Then my senses cleared, and I remembered. As I lay therethinking over the strange events of the past month or two the thoughtcame into my mind, greatly surprising me, that one of Joan's prophecieshad failed; for where were Noel and the Paladin, who were to join us atthe eleventh hour? By this time, you see, I had gotten used to expectingeverything Joan said to come true. So, being disturbed and troubled bythese thoughts, I opened my eyes. Well, there stood the Paladin leaningagainst a tree and looking down on me! How often that happens; you thinkof a person, or speak of a person, and there he stands before you, andyou not dreaming he is near. It looks as if his being near is really thething that makes you think of him, and not just an accident, as peopleimagine. Well, be that as it may, there was the Paladin, anyway, lookingdown in my face and waiting for me to wake. I was ever so glad to seehim, and jumped up and shook him by the hand, and led him a little wayfrom the camp--he limping like a cripple--and told him to sit down, andsaid:
"Now, where have you dropped down from? And how did you happen to lightin this place? And what do the soldier-clothes mean? Tell me all aboutit."
He answered:
"I marched with you last night."
"No!" (To myself I said, "The prophecy has not all failed--half of it hascome true.") "Yes, I did. I hurried up from Domremy to join, and waswithin a half a minute of being too late. In fact, I was too late, but Ibegged so hard that the governor was touched by my brave devotion to mycountry's cause--those are the words he used--and so he yielded, andallowed me to come."
I thought to myself, this is a lie, he is one of those six the governorrecruited by force at the last moment; I know it, for Joan's prophecysaid he would join at the eleventh hour, but not by his own desire. ThenI said aloud:
"I am glad you came; it is a noble cause, and one should not sit at homein times like these."
"Sit at home! I could no more do it than the thunderstone could stay hidin the clouds when the storm calls it."
"That is the right talk. It sounds like you."
That pleased him.
"I'm glad you know me. Some don't. But they will, presently. They willknow me well enough before I get done with this war."
"That is what I think. I believe that wherever danger confronts you youwill make yourself conspicuous."
He was charmed with this speech, and it swelled him up like a bladder. Hesaid:
"If I know myself--and I think I do--my performances in this campaignwill give you occasion more than once to remember those words."
"I were a fool to doubt it. That I know."
"I shall not be at my best, being but a common soldier; still, thecountry will hear of me. If I were where I belong; if I were in the placeof La Hire, or Saintrailles, or the Bastard of Orleans--well, I saynothing. I am not of the talking kind, like Noel Rainguesson and hissort, I thank God. But it will be something, I take it--a novelty in thisworld, I should say--to raise the fame of a private soldier above theirs,and extinguish the glory of their names with its shadow."
"Why, look here, my friend," I said, "do you know that you have hit out amost remarkable idea there? Do you realize the gigantic proportions ofit? For look you; to be a general of vast renown, what is that?Nothing--history is clogged and confused with them; one cannot keep theirnames in his memory, there are so many. But a common soldier of supremerenown--why, he would stand alone! He would the be one moon in afirmament of mustard-seed stars; his name would outlast the human race!My friend, who gave you that idea?"
He was ready to burst with happiness, but he suppressed betrayal of it aswell as he could. He simply waved the compliment aside with his hand andsaid, with complacency:
"It is nothing. I have them often--ideas like that--and even greaterones. I do not consider this one much."
"You astonish me; you do, indeed. So it is really your own?"
"Quite. And there is plenty more where it came from"--tapping his headwith his finger, and taking occasion at the same time to cant his morionover his right ear, which gave him a very self-satisfied air--"I do notneed to borrow my ideas, like Noel Rainguesson."
"Speaking of Noel, when did you see him last?"
"Half an hour ago. He is sleeping yonder like a corpse. Rode with us lastnight."
I felt a great upleap in my heart, and said to myself, now I am at restand glad; I will never doubt her prophecies again. Then I said aloud:
"It gives me joy. It makes me proud of our village. There is not keepingour lion-hearts at home in these great times, I see that."
"Lion-heart! Who--that baby? Why, he begged like a dog to be let off.Cried, and said he wanted to go to his mother. Him a lion-heart!--thattumble-bug!"
"Dear me, why I supposed he volunteered, of course. Didn't he?"
"Oh, yes, he volunteered the way people do to the headsman. Why, when hefound I was coming up from Domremy to volunteer, he asked me to let himcome along in my protection, and see the crowds and the excitement. Well,we arrived and saw the torches filing out at the Castle, and ran there,and the governor had him seized, along with four more, and he begged tobe let off, and I begged for his place, and at last the governor allowedme to join, but wouldn't let Noel off, because he was disgusted with him,he was such a cry-baby. Yes, and much good he'll do the King's service;he'll eat for six and run for sixteen. I hate a pygmy with half a heartand nine stomachs!"
"Why, this is very surprising news to me, and I am sorry and disappointedto hear it. I thought he was a very manly fellow."
The Paladin gave me an outraged look, and said:
"I don't see how you can talk like that, I'm sure I don't. I don't seehow you could have got such a notion. I don't dislike him, and I'm notsaying these things out of prejudice, for I don't allow myself to haveprejudices against people. I like him, and have always comraded with himfrom the cradle, but he must allow me to speak my mind about his faults,and I am willing he shall speak his about mine, if I have any. And, trueenough, maybe I have; but I reckon they'll bear inspection--I have thatidea, anyway. A manly fellow! You should have heard him whine and wailand swear, last night, because the saddle hurt him. Why didn't the saddlehurt me? Pooh--I was as much at home in it as if I had been born there.And yet it was the first time I was ever on a horse. All those oldsoldiers admired my riding; they said they had never seen anything likeit. But him--why, they had to hold him on, all the time."
An odor as of breakfast came stealing through the wood; the Paladinunconsciously inflated his nostrils in lustful response, and got up andlimped painfully away, saying he must go and look to his horse.
At bottom he was all right and a good-hearted giant, without any harm inhim, for it is no harm to bark, if one stops there and does not bite, andit is no harm to be an ass, if one is content to bray and not kick. Ifthis vast structure of brawn and muscle and vanity and foolishness seemedto have a libelous tongue, what of it? There was no malice behind it; andbesides, the defect was not of his own creation; it was the work of NoelRainguesson, who had nurtured it, fostered it, built it up and perfectedit, for the entertainment he got out of it. His careless light heart hadto have somebody to nag and chaff and make fun of, the Paladin had onlyneeded development in order to meet its requirements, consequently thedevelopment was taken in hand and diligently attended to and lookedafter, gnat-and-bull fashion, for years, to the neglect and damage of farmore important concerns. The result was an unqualified success. Noelprized the society of the Paladin above everybody else's; the Paladinpreferred anybody's to Noel's. The big fellow was often seen with thelittle fellow, but it was for the same reason that the bull is often seenwith the gnat.
With the first opportunity, I had a talk with Noel. I welcomed him to ourexpedition, and said:
"It was fine and brave of you to volunteer, Noel."
His eye twinkled, and he answered:
"Yes, it was rather fine, I think. Still, the credit doesn't all belongto me; I had help."
"Who helped you?"
"The governor."
"How?"
"Well, I'll tell you the whole thing. I came up from Domremy to see thecrowds and the general show, for I hadn't ever had any experience of suchthings, of course, and this was a great opportunity; but I hadn't anymind to volunteer. I overtook the Paladin on the road and let him have mycompany the rest of the way, although he did not want it and said so; andwhile we were gawking and blinking in the glare of the governor's torchesthey seized us and four more and added us to the escort, and that isreally how I came to volunteer. But, after all, I wasn't sorry,remembering how dull life would have been in the village without thePaladin."
"How did he feel about it? Was he satisfied?"
"I think he was glad."
"Why?"
"Because he said he wasn't. He was taken by surprise, you see, and it isnot likely that he could tell the truth without preparation. Not that hewould have prepared, if he had had the chance, for I do not think hewould. I am not charging him with that. In the same space of time that hecould prepare to speak the truth, he could also prepare to lie; besides,his judgment would be cool then, and would warn him against fooling withnew methods in an emergency. No, I am sure he was glad, because he saidhe wasn't."
"Do you think he was very glad?"
"Yes, I know he was. He begged like a slave, and bawled for his mother.He said his health was delicate, and he didn't know how to ride a horse,and he knew he couldn't outlive the first march. But really he wasn'tlooking as delicate as he was feeling. There was a cask of wine there, aproper lift for four men. The governor's temper got afire, and hedelivered an oath at him that knocked up the dust where it struck theground, and told him to shoulder that cask or he would carve him tocutlets and send him home in a basket. The Paladin did it, and thatsecured his promotion to a privacy in the escort without any furtherdebate."
"Yes, you seem to make it quite plain that he was glad to join--that is,if your premises are right that you start from. How did he stand themarch last night?"
"About as I did. If he made the more noise, it was the privilege of hisbulk. We stayed in our saddles because we had help. We are equally lameto-day, and if he likes to sit down, let him; I prefer to stand."
