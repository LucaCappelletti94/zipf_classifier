Do not undervalue the headache. While it is at its sharpest it seems abad investment; but when relief begins, the unexpired remainder is worth$4 a minute. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
A comfortable railway journey of seventeen and a half hours brought us tothe capital of India, which is likewise the capital of Bengal--Calcutta.Like Bombay, it has a population of nearly a million natives and a smallgathering of white people. It is a huge city and fine, and is called theCity of Palaces. It is rich in historical memories; rich in Britishachievement--military, political, commercial; rich in the results of themiracles done by that brace of mighty magicians, Clive and Hastings. Andhas a cloud kissing monument to one Ochterlony.
It is a fluted candlestick 250 feet high. This lingam is the only largemonument in Calcutta, I believe. It is a fine ornament, and will keepOchterlony in mind.
Wherever you are, in Calcutta, and for miles around, you can see it; andalways when you see it you think of Ochterlony. And so there is not anhour in the day that you do not think of Ochterlony and wonder who hewas. It is good that Clive cannot come back, for he would think it wasfor Plassey; and then that great spirit would be wounded when therevelation came that it was not. Clive would find out that it was forOchterlony; and he would think Ochterlony was a battle. And he wouldthink it was a great one, too, and he would say, "With three thousand Iwhipped sixty thousand and founded the Empire--and there is no monument;this other soldier must have whipped a billion with a dozen and saved theworld."
But he would be mistaken. Ochterlony was a man, not a battle. And hedid good and honorable service, too; as good and honorable service as hasbeen done in India by seventy-five or a hundred other Englishmen ofcourage, rectitude, and distinguished capacity. For India has been afertile breeding-ground of such men, and remains so; great men, both inwar and in the civil service, and as modest as great. But they have nomonuments, and were not expecting any. Ochterlony could not have beenexpecting one, and it is not at all likely that he desired one--certainlynot until Clive and Hastings should be supplied. Every day Clive andHastings lean on the battlements of heaven and look down and wonder whichof the two the monument is for; and they fret and worry because theycannot find out, and so the peace of heaven is spoiled for them and lost.But not for Ochterlony. Ochterlony is not troubled. He doesn't suspectthat it is his monument. Heaven is sweet and peaceful to him. There isa sort of unfairness about it all.
Indeed, if monuments were always given in India for high achievements,duty straitly performed, and smirchless records, the landscape would bemonotonous with them. The handful of English in India govern the Indianmyriads with apparent ease, and without noticeable friction, throughtact, training, and distinguished administrative ability, reinforced byjust and liberal laws--and by keeping their word to the native wheneverthey give it.
England is far from India and knows little about the eminent servicesperformed by her servants there, for it is the newspaper correspondentwho makes fame, and he is not sent to India but to the continent, toreport the doings of the princelets and the dukelets, and where they arevisiting and whom they are marrying. Often a British official spendsthirty or forty years in India, climbing from grade to grade by serviceswhich would make him celebrated anywhere else, and finishes as avice-sovereign, governing a great realm and millions of subjects; then hegoes home to England substantially unknown and unheard of, and settlesdown in some modest corner, and is as one extinguished. Ten years laterthere is a twenty-line obituary in the London papers, and the reader isparalyzed by the splendors of a career which he is not sure that he hadever heard of before. But meanwhile he has learned all about thecontinental princelets and dukelets.
The average man is profoundly ignorant of countries that lie remote fromhis own. When they are mentioned in his presence one or two facts andmaybe a couple of names rise like torches in his mind, lighting up aninch or two of it and leaving the rest all dark. The mention of Egyptsuggests some Biblical facts and the Pyramids-nothing more. The mentionof South Africa suggests Kimberly and the diamonds and there an end.Formerly the mention, to a Hindoo, of America suggested a name--GeorgeWashington--with that his familiarity with our country was exhausted.Latterly his familiarity with it has doubled in bulk; so that whenAmerica is mentioned now, two torches flare up in the dark caverns of hismind and he says, "Ah, the country of the great man Washington; and ofthe Holy City--Chicago." For he knows about the Congress of Religion, andthis has enabled him to get an erroneous impression of Chicago.
When India is mentioned to the citizen of a far country it suggestsClive, Hastings, the Mutiny, Kipling, and a number of other great events;and the mention of Calcutta infallibly brings up the Black Hole. And so,when that citizen finds himself in the capital of India he goes first ofall to see the Black Hole of Calcutta--and is disappointed.
The Black Hole was not preserved; it is gone, long, long ago. It isstrange. Just as it stood, it was itself a monument; a ready-made one.It was finished, it was complete, its materials were strong and lasting,it needed no furbishing up, no repairs; it merely needed to be let alone.It was the first brick, the Foundation Stone, upon which was reared amighty Empire--the Indian Empire of Great Britain. It was the ghastlyepisode of the Black Hole that maddened the British and brought Clive,that young military marvel, raging up from Madras; it was the seed fromwhich sprung Plassey; and it was that extraordinary battle, whose likehad not been seen in the earth since Agincourt, that laid deep and strongthe foundations of England's colossal Indian sovereignty.
And yet within the time of men who still live, the Black Hole was torndown and thrown away as carelessly as if its bricks were common clay, notingots of historic gold. There is no accounting for human beings.
The supposed site of the Black Hole is marked by an engraved plate. Isaw that; and better that than nothing. The Black Hole was a prison--acell is nearer the right word--eighteen feet square, the dimensions of anordinary bedchamber; and into this place the victorious Nabob of Bengalpacked 146 of his English prisoners. There was hardly standing room forthem; scarcely a breath of air was to be got; the time was night, theweather sweltering hot. Before the dawn came, the captives were all deadbut twenty-three. Mr. Holwell's long account of the awful episode wasfamiliar to the world a hundred years ago, but one seldom sees in printeven an extract from it in our day. Among the striking things in it isthis. Mr. Holwell, perishing with thirst, kept himself alive by suckingthe perspiration from his sleeves. It gives one a vivid idea of thesituation. He presently found that while he was busy drawing life fromone of his sleeves a young English gentleman was stealing supplies fromthe other one. Holwell was an unselfish man, a man of the most generousimpulses; he lived and died famous for these fine and rare qualities; yetwhen he found out what was happening to that unwatched sleeve, he tookthe precaution to suck that one dry first. The miseries of the BlackHole were able to change even a nature like his. But that younggentleman was one of the twenty-three survivors, and he said it was thestolen perspiration that saved his life. From the middle of Mr.Holwell's narrative I will make a brief excerpt:
 "Then a general prayer to Heaven, to hasten the approach of the flames to the right and left of us, and put a period to our misery. But these failing, they whose strength and spirits were quite exhausted laid themselves down and expired quietly upon their fellows: others who had yet some strength and vigor left made a last effort at the windows, and several succeeded by leaping and scrambling over the backs and heads of those in the first rank, and got hold of the bars, from which there was no removing them. Many to the right and left sunk with the violent pressure, and were soon suffocated; for now a steam arose from the living and the dead, which affected us in all its circumstances as if we were forcibly held with our heads over a bowl full of strong volatile spirit of hartshorn, until suffocated; nor could the effluvia of the one be distinguished from the other, and frequently, when I was forced by the load upon my head and shoulders to hold my face down, I was obliged, near as I was to the window, instantly to raise it again to avoid suffocation. I need not, my dear friend, ask your commiseration, when I tell you, that in this plight, from half an hour past eleven till near two in the morning, I sustained the weight of a heavy man, with his knees in my back, and the pressure of his whole body on my head. A Dutch surgeon who had taken his seat upon my left shoulder, and a Topaz (a black Christian soldier) bearing on my right; all which nothing could have enabled me to support but the props and pressure equally sustaining me all around. The two latter I frequently dislodged by shifting my hold on the bars and driving my knuckles into their ribs; but my friend above stuck fast, held immovable by two bars.
 "I exerted anew my strength and fortitude; but the repeated trials and efforts I made to dislodge the insufferable incumbrances upon me at last quite exhausted me; and towards two o'clock, finding I must quit the window or sink where I was, I resolved on the former, having bore, truly for the sake of others, infinitely more for life than the best of it is worth. In the rank close behind me was an officer of one of the ships, whose name was Cary, and who had behaved with much bravery during the siege (his wife, a fine woman, though country born, would not quit him, but accompanied him into the prison, and was one who survived). This poor wretch had been long raving for water and air; I told him I was determined to give up life, and recommended his gaining my station. On my quitting it he made a fruitless attempt to get my place; but the Dutch surgeon, who sat on my shoulder, supplanted him. Poor Cary expressed his thankfulness, and said he would give up life too; but it was with the utmost labor we forced our way from the window (several in the inner ranks appearing to me dead standing, unable to fall by the throng and equal pressure around). He laid himself down to die; and his death, I believe, was very sudden; for he was a short, full, sanguine man. His strength was great; and, I imagine, had he not retired with me, I should never have been able to force my way. I was at this time sensible of no pain, and little uneasiness; I can give you no better idea of my situation than by repeating my simile of the bowl of spirit of hartshorn. I found a stupor coming on apace, and laid myself down by that gallant old man, the Rev. Mr. Jervas Bellamy, who laid dead with his son, the lieutenant, hand in hand, near the southernmost wall of the prison. When I had lain there some little time, I still had reflection enough to suffer some uneasiness in the thought that I should be trampled upon, when dead, as I myself had done to others. With some difficulty I raised myself, and gained the platform a second time, where I presently lost all sensation; the last trace of sensibility that I have been able to recollect after my laying down, was my sash being uneasy about my waist, which I untied, and threw from me. Of what passed in this interval, to the time of my resurrection from this hole of horrors, I can give you no account."
There was plenty to see in Calcutta, but there was not plenty of time forit. I saw the fort that Clive built; and the place where Warren Hastingsand the author of the Junius Letters fought their duel; and the greatbotanical gardens; and the fashionable afternoon turnout in the Maidan;and a grand review of the garrison in a great plain at sunrise; and amilitary tournament in which great bodies of native soldiery exhibitedthe perfection of their drill at all arms, a spectacular and beautifulshow occupying several nights and closing with the mimic storming of anative fort which was as good as the reality for thrilling and accuratedetail, and better than the reality for security and comfort; we had apleasure excursion on the 'Hoogly' by courtesy of friends, and devotedthe rest of the time to social life and the Indian museum. One shouldspend a month in the museum, an enchanted palace of Indian antiquities.Indeed, a person might spend half a year among the beautiful andwonderful things without exhausting their interest.
It was winter. We were of Kipling's "hosts of tourists who travel up anddown India in the cold weather showing how things ought to be managed."It is a common expression there, "the cold weather," and the people thinkthere is such a thing. It is because they have lived there half alifetime, and their perceptions have become blunted. When a person isaccustomed to 138 in the shade, his ideas about cold weather are notvaluable. I had read, in the histories, that the June marches madebetween Lucknow and Cawnpore by the British forces in the time of theMutiny were made weather--138 in the shade and had taken it forhistorical embroidery. I had read it again in Serjeant-MajorForbes-Mitchell's account of his military experiences in the Mutiny--at least I thought I had--and in Calcutta I asked him if it was true,and he said it was. An officer of high rank who had been in the thick ofthe Mutiny said the same. As long as those men were talking about whatthey knew, they were trustworthy, and I believed them; but when they saidit was now "cold weather," I saw that they had traveled outside of theirsphere of knowledge and were floundering. I believe that in India "coldweather" is merely a conventional phrase and has come into use throughthe necessity of having some way to distinguish between weather whichwill melt a brass door-knob and weather which will only make it mushy.It was observable that brass ones were in use while I was in Calcutta,showing that it was not yet time to change to porcelain; I was told thechange to porcelain was not usually made until May. But this coldweather was too warm for us; so we started to Darjeeling, in theHimalayas--a twenty-four hour journey.
