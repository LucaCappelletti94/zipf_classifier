"Thorndike, isn't that Plug you're riding an assert of the scrapyou and Buffalo Bill had with the late Blake Haskins and his pal afew months back?"
"Yes, this is Mongrel - and not a half-bad horse, either."
"I've noticed he keeps up his lick first-rate.  Say - isn't it agaudy morning?"
"Right you are!"
"Thorndike, it's Andalusian! and when that's said, all's said."
"Andalusian AND Oregonian, Antonio!  Put it that way, and you havemy vote.  Being a native up there, I know.  You being Andalusian-born - "
"Can speak with authority for that patch of paradise?  Well, I can.Like the Don! like Sancho!  This is the correct Andalusian dawn now- crisp, fresh, dewy, fragrant, pungent - "
"'What though the spicy breezesBlow soft o'er Ceylon's isle - '
- GIT up, you old cow! stumbling like that when we've just beenpraising you! out on a scout and can't live up to the honor anybetter than that?  Antonio, how long have you been out here in thePlains and the Rockies?"
"More than thirteen years."
"It's a long time.  Don't you ever get homesick?"
"Not till now."
"Why NOW? - after such a long cure."
"These preparations of the retiring commandant's have started itup."
"Of course.  It's natural."
"It keeps me thinking about Spain.  I know the region where theSeventh's child's aunt lives; I know all the lovely country formiles around; I'll bet I've seen her aunt's villa many a time; I'llbet I've been in it in those pleasant old times when I was aSpanish gentleman."
"They say the child is wild to see Spain."
"It's so; I know it from what I hear."
"Haven't you talked with her about it?"
"No.  I've avoided it.  I should soon be as wild as she is.  Thatwould not be comfortable."
"I wish I was going, Antonio.  There's two things I'd give a lot tosee.  One's a railroad."
"She'll see one when she strikes Missouri."
"The other's a bull-fight."
"I've seen lots of them; I wish I could see another."
"I don't know anything about it, except in a mixed-up, foggy way,Antonio, but I know enough to know it's grand sport."
"The grandest in the world!  There's no other sport that beginswith it.  I'll tell you what I've seen, then you can judge.  It wasmy first, and it's as vivid to me now as it was when I saw it.  Itwas a Sunday afternoon, and beautiful weather, and my uncle, thepriest, took me as a reward for being a good boy and because of myown accord and without anybody asking me I had bankrupted mysavings-box and given the money to a mission that was civilizingthe Chinese and sweetening their lives and softening their heartswith the gentle teachings of our religion, and I wish you couldhave seen what we saw that day, Thorndike.
"The amphitheatre was packed, from the bull-ring to the highest row- twelve thousand people in one circling mass, one slanting, solidmass - royalties, nobles, clergy, ladies, gentlemen, stateofficials, generals, admirals, soldiers, sailors, lawyers, thieves,merchants, brokers, cooks, housemaids, scullery-maids, doubtfulwomen, dudes, gamblers, beggars, loafers, tramps, American ladies,gentlemen, preachers, English ladies, gentlemen, preachers, Germanditto, French ditto, and so on and so on, all the worldrepresented:  Spaniards to admire and praise, foreigners to enjoyand go home and find fault - there they were, one solid, sloping,circling sweep of rippling and flashing color under the downpour ofthe summer sun - just a garden, a gaudy, gorgeous flower-garden!Children munching oranges, six thousand fans fluttering andglimmering, everybody happy, everybody chatting gayly with theirintimates, lovely girl-faces smiling recognition and salutation toother lovely girl-faces, gray old ladies and gentlemen dealing inthe like exchanges with each other - ah, such a picture of cheerycontentment and glad anticipation! not a mean spirit, nor a sordidsoul, nor a sad heart there - ah, Thorndike, I wish I could see itagain.
"Suddenly, the martial note of a bugle cleaves the hum and murmur -clear the ring!
"They clear it.  The great gate is flung open, and the processionmarches in, splendidly costumed and glittering:  the marshals ofthe day, then the picadores on horseback, then the matadores onfoot, each surrounded by his quadrille of CHULOS.  They march tothe box of the city fathers, and formally salute.  The key isthrown, the bull-gate is unlocked.  Another bugle blast - the gateflies open, the bull plunges in, furious, trembling, blinking inthe blinding light, and stands there, a magnificent creature,centre of those multitudinous and admiring eyes, brave, ready forbattle, his attitude a challenge.  He sees his enemy:  horsemensitting motionless, with long spears in rest, upon blindfoldedbroken-down nags, lean and starved, fit only for sport andsacrifice, then the carrion-heap.
"The bull makes a rush, with murder in his eye, but a picador meetshim with a spear-thrust in the shoulder.  He flinches with thepain, and the picador skips out of danger.  A burst of applause forthe picador, hisses for the bull.  Some shout 'Cow!' at the bull,and call him offensive names.  But he is not listening to them, heis there for business; he is not minding the cloak-bearers thatcome fluttering around to confuse him; he chases this way, hechases that way, and hither and yon, scattering the nimblebanderillos in every direction like a spray, and receiving theirmaddening darts in his neck as they dodge and fly - oh, but it's alively spectacle, and brings down the house!  Ah, you should hearthe thundering roar that goes up when the game is at its wildestand brilliant things are done!
"Oh, that first bull, that day, was great!  From the moment thespirit of war rose to flood-tide in him and he got down to hiswork, he began to do wonders.  He tore his way through hispersecutors, flinging one of them clear over the parapet; he bowleda horse and his rider down, and plunged straight for the next, gothome with his horns, wounding both horse and man; on again, hereand there and this way and that; and one after another he tore thebowels out of two horses so that they gushed to the ground, andripped a third one so badly that although they rushed him to coverand shoved his bowels back and stuffed the rents with tow and rodehim against the bull again, he couldn't make the trip; he tried togallop, under the spur, but soon reeled and tottered and fell, allin a heap.  For a while, that bull-ring was the most thrilling andglorious and inspiring sight that ever was seen.  The bullabsolutely cleared it, and stood there alone! monarch of the place.The people went mad for pride in him, and joy and delight, and youcouldn't hear yourself think, for the roar and boom and crash ofapplause."
"Antonio, it carries me clear out of myself just to hear you tellit; it must have been perfectly splendid.  If I live, I'll see abull-fight yet before I die.  Did they kill him?"
"Oh yes; that is what the bull is for.  They tired him out, and gothim at last.  He kept rushing the matador, who always slippedsmartly and gracefully aside in time, waiting for a sure chance;and at last it came; the bull made a deadly plunge for him - wasavoided neatly, and as he sped by, the long sword glided silentlyinto him, between left shoulder and spine - in and in, to the hilt.He crumpled down, dying."
"Ah, Antonio, it IS the noblest sport that ever was.  I would givea year of my life to see it.  Is the bull always killed?"
"Yes.  Sometimes a bull is timid, finding himself in so strange aplace, and he stands trembling, or tries to retreat.  Theneverybody despises him for his cowardice and wants him punished andmade ridiculous; so they hough him from behind, and it is thefunniest thing in the world to see him hobbling around on hissevered legs; the whole vast house goes into hurricanes of laughterover it; I have laughed till the tears ran down my cheeks to seeit.  When he has furnished all the sport he can, he is not anylonger useful, and is killed."
"Well, it is perfectly grand, Antonio, perfectly beautiful.Burning a nigger don't begin."
