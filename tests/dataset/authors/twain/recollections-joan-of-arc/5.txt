Domremy Pillaged and Burned
THEY WERE peaceful and pleasant, those young and smoothly flowing days ofours; that is, that was the case as a rule, we being remote from the seatof war; but at intervals roving bands approached near enough for us tosee the flush in the sky at night which marked where they were burningsome farmstead or village, and we all knew, or at least felt, that someday they would come yet nearer, and we should have our turn. This dulldread lay upon our spirits like a physical weight. It was greatlyaugmented a couple of years after the Treaty of Troyes.
It was truly a dismal year for France. One day we had been over to haveone of our occasional pitched battles with those hated Burgundian boys ofthe village of Maxey, and had been whipped, and were arriving on our sideof the river after dark, bruised and weary, when we heard the bellringing the tocsin. We ran all the way, and when we got to the square wefound it crowded with the excited villagers, and weirdly lighted bysmoking and flaring torches.
On the steps of the church stood a stranger, a Burgundian priest, who wastelling the people new which made them weep, and rave, and rage, andcurse, by turns. He said our old mad King was dead, and that now we andFrance and the crown were the property of an English baby lying in hiscradle in London. And he urged us to give that child our allegiance, andbe its faithful servants and well-wishers; and said we should now have astrong and stable government at last, and that in a little time theEnglish armies would start on their last march, and it would be a briefone, for all that it would need to do would be to conquer what odds andends of our country yet remained under that rare and almost forgottenrag, the banner of France.
The people stormed and raged at him, and you could see dozens of themstretch their fists above the sea of torch-lighted faces and shake themat him; and it was all a wild picture, and stirring to look at; and thepriest was a first-rate part of it, too, for he stood there in the strongglare and looked down on those angry people in the blandest and mostindifferent way, so that while you wanted to burn him at the stake, youstill admired the aggravating coolness of him. And his winding-up was thecoolest thing of all. For he told them how, at the funeral of our oldKing, the French King-at-Arms had broken his staff of office over thecoffin of "Charles VI. and his dynasty," at the same time saying, in aloud voice, "Good grant long life to Henry, King of France and England,our sovereign lord!" and then he asked them to join him in a hearty Amento that! The people were white with wrath, and it tied their tongues forthe moment, and they could not speak. But Joan was standing close by, andshe looked up in his face, and said in her sober, earnest way:
"I would I might see thy head struck from thy body!"--then, after apause, and crossing herself--"if it were the will of God."
This is worth remembering, and I will tell you why: it is the only harshspeech Joan ever uttered in her life. When I shall have revealed to youthe storms she went through, and the wrongs and persecutions, then youwill see that it was wonderful that she said but one bitter thing whileshe lived.
From the day that that dreary news came we had one scare after another,the marauders coming almost to our doors every now and then; so that welived in ever-increasing apprehension, and yet were somehow mercifullyspared from actual attack. But at last our turn did really come. This wasin the spring of '28. The Burgundians swarmed in with a great noise, inthe middle of a dark night, and we had to jump up and fly for our lives.We took the road to Neufchateau, and rushed along in the wildestdisorder, everybody trying to get ahead, and thus the movements of allwere impeded; but Joan had a cool head--the only cool head there--and shetook command and brought order out of that chaos. She did her workquickly and with decision and despatch, and soon turned the panic flightinto a quite steady-going march. You will grant that for so young aperson, and a girl at that, this was a good piece of work.
She was sixteen now, shapely and graceful, and of a beauty soextraordinary that I might allow myself any extravagance of language indescribing it and yet have no fear of going beyond the truth. There wasin her face a sweetness and serenity and purity that justly reflected herspiritual nature. She was deeply religious, and this is a thing whichsometimes gives a melancholy cast to a person's countenance, but it wasnot so in her case. Her religion made her inwardly content and joyous;and if she was troubled at times, and showed the pain of it in her faceand bearing, it came of distress for her country; no part of it waschargeable to her religion.
A considerable part of our village was destroyed, and when it became safefor us to venture back there we realized what other people had beensuffering in all the various quarters of France for many years--yes,decades of years. For the first time we saw wrecked and smoke-blackenedhomes, and in the lanes and alleys carcasses of dumb creatures that hadbeen slaughtered in pure wantonness--among them calves and lambs that hadbeen pets of the children; and it was pity to see the children lamentover them.
And then, the taxes, the taxes! Everybody thought of that. That burdenwould fall heavy now in the commune's crippled condition, and all facesgrew long with the thought of it. Joan said:
"Paying taxes with naught to pay them with is what the rest of France hasbeen doing these many years, but we never knew the bitterness of thatbefore. We shall know it now."
And so she went on talking about it and growing more and more troubledabout it, until one could see that it was filling all her mind.
At last we came upon a dreadful object. It was the madman--hacked andstabbed to death in his iron cage in the corner of the square. It was abloody and dreadful sight. Hardly any of us young people had ever seen aman before who had lost his life by violence; so this cadaver had anawful fascination for us; we could not take our eyes from it. I mean, ithad that sort of fascination for all of us but one. That one was Joan.She turned away in horror, and could not be persuaded to go near itagain. There--it is a striking reminder that we are but creatures of useand custom; yes, and it is a reminder, too, of how harshly and unfairlyfate deals with us sometimes. For it was so ordered that the very onesamong us who were most fascinated with mutilated and bloody death were tolive their lives in peace, while that other, who had a native and deephorror of it, must presently go forth and have it as a familiar spectacleevery day on the field of battle.
You may well believe that we had plenty of matter for talk now, since theraiding of our village seemed by long odds the greatest event that hadreally ever occurred in the world; for although these dull peasants mayhave thought they recognized the bigness of some of the previousoccurrences that had filtered from the world's history dimly into theirminds, the truth is that they hadn't. One biting little fact, visible totheir eyes of flesh and felt in their own personal vitals, became at oncemore prodigious to them than the grandest remote episode in the world'shistory which they had got at second hand and by hearsay. It amuses menow when I recall how our elders talked then. The fumed and fretted in afine fashion.
"Ah, yes," said old Jacques d'Arc, "things are come to a pretty pass,indeed! The King must be informed of this. It is time that he cease fromidleness and dreaming, and get at his proper business." He meant ouryoung disinherited King, the hunted refugee, Charles VII.
"You way well," said the maire. "He should be informed, and that at once.It is an outrage that such things would be permitted. Why, we are notsafe in our beds, and he taking his ease yonder. It shall be made known,indeed it shall--all France shall hear of it!"
To hear them talk, one would have imagined that all the previous tenthousand sackings and burnings in France had been but fables, and thisone the only fact. It is always the way; words will answer as long as itis only a person's neighbor who is in trouble, but when that person getsinto trouble himself, it is time that the King rise up and do something.
The big event filled us young people with talk, too. We let it flow in asteady stream while we tended the flocks. We were beginning to feelpretty important now, for I was eighteen and the other youths were fromone to four years older--young men, in fact. One day the Paladin wasarrogantly criticizing the patriot generals of France and said:
"Look at Dunois, Bastard of Orleans--call him a general! Just put me inhis place once--never mind what I would do, it is not for me to say, Ihave no stomach for talk, my way is to act and let others do thetalking--but just put me in his place once, that's all! And look atSaintrailles--pooh! and that blustering La Hire, now what a general thatis!"
It shocked everybody to hear these great names so flippantly handled, forto us these renowned soldiers were almost gods. In their far-off splendorthey rose upon our imaginations dim and huge, shadowy and awful, and itwas a fearful thing to hear them spoken of as if they were mere men, andtheir acts open to comment and criticism. The color rose in Joan's face,and she said:
"I know not how any can be so hardy as to use such words regarding thesesublime men, who are the very pillars of the French state, supporting itwith their strength and preserving it at daily cost of their blood. Asfor me, I could count myself honored past all deserving if I might beallowed but the privilege of looking upon them once--at a distance, Imean, for it would not become one of my degree to approach them toonear."
The Paladin was disconcerted for a moment, seeing by the faces around himthat Joan had put into words what the others felt, then he pulled hiscomplacency together and fell to fault-finding again. Joan's brother Jeansaid:
"If you don't like what our generals do, why don't you go to the greatwars yourself and better their work? You are always talking about goingto the wars, but you don't go."
"Look you," said the Paladin, "it is easy to say that. Now I will tellyou why I remain chafing here in a bloodless tranquillity which myreputation teaches you is repulsive to my nature. I do not go because Iam not a gentleman. That is the whole reason. What can one privatesoldier do in a contest like this? Nothing. He is not permitted to risefrom the ranks. If I were a gentleman would I remain here? Not onemoment. I can save France--ah, you may laugh, but I know what is in me, Iknow what is hid under this peasant cap. I can save France, and I standready to do it, but not under these present conditions. If they want me,let them send for me; otherwise, let them take the consequences; I shallnot budge but as an officer."
"Alas, poor France--France is lost!" said Pierre d'Arc.
"Since you sniff so at others, why don't you go to the wars yourself,Pierre d'Arc?"
"Oh, I haven't been sent for, either. I am no more a gentleman than you.Yet I will go; I promise to go. I promise to go as a private under yourorders--when you are sent for."
They all laughed, and the Dragon-fly said:
"So soon? Then you need to begin to get ready; you might be called for infive years--who knows? Yes, in my opinion you'll march for the wars infive years."
"He will go sooner," said Joan. She said it in a low voice and musingly,but several heard it.
"How do you know that, Joan?" said the Dragon-fly, with a surprised look.But Jean d'Arc broke in and said:
"I want to go myself, but as I am rather young yet, I also will wait, andmarch when the Paladin is sent for."
"No," said Joan, "he will go with Pierre."
She said it as one who talks to himself aloud without knowing it, andnone heard it but me. I glanced at her and saw that her knitting-needleswere idle in her hands, and that her face had a dreamy and absent look init. There were fleeting movements of her lips as if she might beoccasionally saying parts of sentences to herself. But there was nosound, for I was the nearest person to her and I heard nothing. But I setmy ears open, for those two speeches had affected me uncannily, I beingsuperstitious and easily troubled by any little thing of a strange andunusual sort.
Noel Rainguesson said:
"There is one way to let France have a chance for her salvation. We'vegot one gentleman in the commune, at any rate. Why can't the Scholarchange name and condition with the Paladin? Then he can be an officer.France will send for him then, and he will sweep these English andBurgundian armies into the sea like flies."
I was the Scholar. That was my nickname, because I could read and write.There was a chorus of approval, and the Sunflower said:
"That is the very thing--it settles every difficulty. The Sieur de Contewill easily agree to that. Yes, he will march at the back of CaptainPaladin and die early, covered with common-soldier glory."
"He will march with Jean and Pierre, and live till these wars areforgotten," Joan muttered; "and at the eleventh hour Noel and the Paladinwill join these, but not of their own desire." The voice was so low thatI was not perfectly sure that these were the words, but they seemed tobe. It makes one feel creepy to hear such things.
"Come, now," Noel continued, "it's all arranged; there's nothing to dobut organize under the Paladin's banner and go forth and rescue France.You'll all join?"
All said yes, except Jacques d'Arc, who said:
"I'll ask you to excuse me. It is pleasant to talk war, and I am with youthere, and I've always thought I should go soldiering about this time,but the look of our wrecked village and that carved-up and bloody madmanhave taught me that I am not made for such work and such sights. I couldnever be at home in that trade. Face swords and the big guns and death?It isn't in me. No, no; count me out. And besides, I'm the eldest son,and deputy prop and protector of the family. Since you are going to carryJean and Pierre to the wars, somebody must be left behind to take care ofour Joan and her sister. I shall stay at home, and grow old in peace andtranquillity."
"He will stay at home, but not grow old," murmured Joan.
The talk rattled on in the gay and careless fashion privileged to youth,and we got the Paladin to map out his campaigns and fight his battles andwin his victories and extinguish the English and put our King upon histhrone and set his crown upon his head. Then we asked him what he wasgoing to answer when the King should require him to name his reward. ThePaladin had it all arranged in his head, and brought it out promptly:
"He shall give me a dukedom, name me premier peer, and make me HereditaryLord High Constable of France."
"And marry you to a princess--you're not going to leave that out, areyou?"
The Paladin colored a trifle, and said, brusquely:
"He may keep his princesses--I can marry more to my taste."
Meaning Joan, though nobody suspected it at that time. If any had, thePaladin would have been finely ridiculed for his vanity. There was no fitmate in that village for Joan of Arc. Every one would have said that.
In turn, each person present was required to say what reward he woulddemand of the King if he could change places with the Paladin and do thewonders the Paladin was going to do. The answers were given in fun, andeach of us tried to outdo his predecessors in the extravagance of thereward he would claim; but when it came to Joan's turn, and they ralliedher out of her dreams and asked her to testify, they had to explain toher what the question was, for her thought had been absent, and she hadheard none of this latter part of our talk. She supposed they wanted aserious answer, and she gave it. She sat considering some moments, thenshe said:
"If the Dauphin, out of his grace and nobleness, should say to me, 'Nowthat I am rich and am come to my own again, choose and have,' I shouldkneel and ask him to give command that our village should nevermore betaxed."
It was so simple and out of her heart that it touched us and we did notlaugh, but fell to thinking. We did not laugh; but there came a day whenwe remembered that speech with a mournful pride, and were glad that wehad not laughed, perceiving then how honest her words had been, andseeing how faithfully she made them good when the time came, asking justthat boon of the King and refusing to take even any least thing forherself.
