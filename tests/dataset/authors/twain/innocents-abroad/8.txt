This is royal! Let those who went up through Spain make the best of it--these dominions of the Emperor of Morocco suit our little party wellenough. We have had enough of Spain at Gibraltar for the present.Tangier is the spot we have been longing for all the time. Elsewhere wehave found foreign-looking things and foreign-looking people, but alwayswith things and people intermixed that we were familiar with before, andso the novelty of the situation lost a deal of its force. We wantedsomething thoroughly and uncompromisingly foreign--foreign from top tobottom--foreign from center to circumference--foreign inside and outsideand all around--nothing anywhere about it to dilute its foreignness--nothing to remind us of any other people or any other land under the sun.And lo! In Tangier we have found it. Here is not the slightest thingthat ever we have seen save in pictures--and we always mistrusted thepictures before. We cannot anymore. The pictures used to seemexaggerations--they seemed too weird and fanciful for reality. Butbehold, they were not wild enough--they were not fanciful enough--theyhave not told half the story. Tangier is a foreign land if ever therewas one, and the true spirit of it can never be found in any book saveThe Arabian Nights. Here are no white men visible, yet swarms ofhumanity are all about us. Here is a packed and jammed city enclosed ina massive stone wall which is more than a thousand years old. All thehouses nearly are one-and two-story, made of thick walls of stone,plastered outside, square as a dry-goods box, flat as a floor on top, nocornices, whitewashed all over--a crowded city of snowy tombs! And thedoors are arched with the peculiar arch we see in Moorish pictures; thefloors are laid in varicolored diamond flags; in tesselated, many-coloredporcelain squares wrought in the furnaces of Fez; in red tiles and broadbricks that time cannot wear; there is no furniture in the rooms (ofJewish dwellings) save divans--what there is in Moorish ones no man mayknow; within their sacred walls no Christian dog can enter. And thestreets are oriental--some of them three feet wide, some six, but onlytwo that are over a dozen; a man can blockade the most of them byextending his body across them. Isn't it an oriental picture?
There are stalwart Bedouins of the desert here, and stately Moors proudof a history that goes back to the night of time; and Jews whose fathersfled hither centuries upon centuries ago; and swarthy Riffians from themountains--born cut-throats--and original, genuine Negroes as black asMoses; and howling dervishes and a hundred breeds of Arabs--all sorts anddescriptions of people that are foreign and curious to look upon.
And their dresses are strange beyond all description. Here is a bronzedMoor in a prodigious white turban, curiously embroidered jacket, gold andcrimson sash, of many folds, wrapped round and round his waist, trousersthat only come a little below his knee and yet have twenty yards of stuffin them, ornamented scimitar, bare shins, stockingless feet, yellowslippers, and gun of preposterous length--a mere soldier!--I thought hewas the Emperor at least. And here are aged Moors with flowing whitebeards and long white robes with vast cowls; and Bedouins with long,cowled, striped cloaks; and Negroes and Riffians with heads clean-shavenexcept a kinky scalp lock back of the ear or, rather, upon the aftercorner of the skull; and all sorts of barbarians in all sorts of weirdcostumes, and all more or less ragged. And here are Moorish women whoare enveloped from head to foot in coarse white robes, and whose sex canonly be determined by the fact that they only leave one eye visible andnever look at men of their own race, or are looked at by them in public.Here are five thousand Jews in blue gabardines, sashes about theirwaists, slippers upon their feet, little skullcaps upon the backs oftheir heads, hair combed down on the forehead, and cut straight acrossthe middle of it from side to side--the selfsame fashion their Tangierancestors have worn for I don't know how many bewildering centuries.Their feet and ankles are bare. Their noses are all hooked, and hookedalike. They all resemble each other so much that one could almostbelieve they were of one family. Their women are plump and pretty, anddo smile upon a Christian in a way which is in the last degreecomforting.
What a funny old town it is! It seems like profanation to laugh and jestand bandy the frivolous chat of our day amid its hoary relics. Only thestately phraseology and the measured speech of the sons of the Prophetare suited to a venerable antiquity like this. Here is a crumbling wallthat was old when Columbus discovered America; was old when Peter theHermit roused the knightly men of the Middle Ages to arm for the firstCrusade; was old when Charlemagne and his paladins beleaguered enchantedcastles and battled with giants and genii in the fabled days of the oldentime; was old when Christ and his disciples walked the earth; stood whereit stands today when the lips of Memnon were vocal and men bought andsold in the streets of ancient Thebes!
The Phoenicians, the Carthagenians, the English, Moors, Romans, all havebattled for Tangier--all have won it and lost it. Here is a ragged,oriental-looking Negro from some desert place in interior Africa, fillinghis goatskin with water from a stained and battered fountain built by theRomans twelve hundred years ago. Yonder is a ruined arch of a bridgebuilt by Julius Caesar nineteen hundred years ago. Men who had seen theinfant Saviour in the Virgin's arms have stood upon it, maybe.
Near it are the ruins of a dockyard where Caesar repaired his ships andloaded them with grain when he invaded Britain, fifty years before theChristian era.
Here, under the quiet stars, these old streets seem thronged with thephantoms of forgotten ages. My eyes are resting upon a spot where stooda monument which was seen and described by Roman historians less than twothousand years ago, whereon was inscribed:
 "WE ARE THE CANAANITES. WE ARE THEY THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE LAND OF CANAAN BY THE JEWISH ROBBER, JOSHUA."
Joshua drove them out, and they came here. Not many leagues from here isa tribe of Jews whose ancestors fled thither after an unsuccessful revoltagainst King David, and these their descendants are still under a ban andkeep to themselves.
Tangier has been mentioned in history for three thousand years. And itwas a town, though a queer one, when Hercules, clad in his lion skin,landed here, four thousand years ago. In these streets he met Anitus,the king of the country, and brained him with his club, which was thefashion among gentlemen in those days. The people of Tangier (calledTingis then) lived in the rudest possible huts and dressed in skins andcarried clubs, and were as savage as the wild beasts they were constantlyobliged to war with. But they were a gentlemanly race and did no work.They lived on the natural products of the land. Their king's countryresidence was at the famous Garden of Hesperides, seventy miles down thecoast from here. The garden, with its golden apples (oranges), is gonenow--no vestige of it remains. Antiquarians concede that such apersonage as Hercules did exist in ancient times and agree that he was anenterprising and energetic man, but decline to believe him a good,bona-fide god, because that would be unconstitutional.
Down here at Cape Spartel is the celebrated cave of Hercules, where thathero took refuge when he was vanquished and driven out of the Tangiercountry. It is full of inscriptions in the dead languages, which factmakes me think Hercules could not have traveled much, else he would nothave kept a journal.
Five days' journey from here--say two hundred miles--are the ruins of anancient city, of whose history there is neither record nor tradition.And yet its arches, its columns, and its statues proclaim it to have beenbuilt by an enlightened race.
The general size of a store in Tangier is about that of an ordinaryshower bath in a civilized land. The Muhammadan merchant, tinman,shoemaker, or vendor of trifles sits cross-legged on the floor andreaches after any article you may want to buy. You can rent a wholeblock of these pigeonholes for fifty dollars a month. The market peoplecrowd the marketplace with their baskets of figs, dates, melons,apricots, etc., and among them file trains of laden asses, not muchlarger, if any, than a Newfoundland dog. The scene is lively, ispicturesque, and smells like a police court. The Jewish money-changershave their dens close at hand, and all day long are counting bronze coinsand transferring them from one bushel basket to another. They don't coinmuch money nowadays, I think. I saw none but what was dated four or fivehundred years back, and was badly worn and battered. These coins are notvery valuable. Jack went out to get a napoleon changed, so as to havemoney suited to the general cheapness of things, and came back and saidhe had "swamped the bank, had bought eleven quarts of coin, and the headof the firm had gone on the street to negotiate for the balance of thechange." I bought nearly half a pint of their money for a shillingmyself. I am not proud on account of having so much money, though. Icare nothing for wealth.
The Moors have some small silver coins and also some silver slugs worth adollar each. The latter are exceedingly scarce--so much so that whenpoor ragged Arabs see one they beg to be allowed to kiss it.
They have also a small gold coin worth two dollars. And that reminds meof something. When Morocco is in a state of war, Arab couriers carryletters through the country and charge a liberal postage. Every now andthen they fall into the hands of marauding bands and get robbed.Therefore, warned by experience, as soon as they have collected twodollars' worth of money they exchange it for one of those little goldpieces, and when robbers come upon them, swallow it. The stratagem wasgood while it was unsuspected, but after that the marauders simply gavethe sagacious United States mail an emetic and sat down to wait.
The Emperor of Morocco is a soulless despot, and the great officers underhim are despots on a smaller scale. There is no regular system oftaxation, but when the Emperor or the Bashaw want money, they levy onsome rich man, and he has to furnish the cash or go to prison.Therefore, few men in Morocco dare to be rich. It is too dangerous aluxury. Vanity occasionally leads a man to display wealth, but sooner orlater the Emperor trumps up a charge against him--any sort of one willdo--and confiscates his property. Of course, there are many rich men inthe empire, but their money is buried, and they dress in rags andcounterfeit poverty. Every now and then the Emperor imprisons a man whois suspected of the crime of being rich, and makes things souncomfortable for him that he is forced to discover where he has hiddenhis money.
Moors and Jews sometimes place themselves under the protection of theforeign consuls, and then they can flout their riches in the Emperor'sface with impunity.
