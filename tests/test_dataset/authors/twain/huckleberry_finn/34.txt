"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not thinkof it before! I bet I know where Jim is."
"No! Where?"
"In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, lookyhere. When we was at dinner, didn't you see a niggerman go in there with some vittles?"
"Yes."
"What did you think the vittles was for?"
"For a dog."
"So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."
"Why?"
"Because part of it was watermelon."
"So it was -- I noticed it. Well, it does beat allthat I never thought about a dog not eating water-melon. It shows how a body can see and don't see atthe same time."
"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when hewent in, and he locked it again when he came out. Hefetched uncle a key about the time we got up fromtable -- same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man,lock shows prisoner; and it ain't likely there's twoprisoners on such a little plantation, and where thepeople's all so kind and good. Jim's the prisoner.All right -- I'm glad we found it out detective fashion;I wouldn't give shucks for any other way. Now youwork your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, andI will study out one, too; and we'll take the one welike the best."
What a head for just a boy to have! If I had TomSawyer's head I wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, normate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothingI can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but onlyjust to be doing something; I knowed very well wherethe right plan was going to come from. Pretty soonTom says:
"Ready?"
"Yes," I says.
"All right -- bring it out."
"My plan is this," I says. "We can easy find outif it's Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrownight, and fetch my raft over from the island. Thenthe first dark night that comes steal the key out of theold man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove offdown the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimesand running nights, the way me and Jim used to do be-fore. Wouldn't that plan work?"
"WORK? Why, cert'nly it would work, like ratsa-fighting. But it's too blame' simple; there ain'tnothing TO it. What's the good of a plan that ain't nomore trouble than that? It's as mild as goose-milk.Why, Huck, it wouldn't make no more talk than break-ing into a soap factory."
I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting noth-ing different; but I knowed mighty well that wheneverhe got HIS plan ready it wouldn't have none of themobjections to it.
And it didn't. He told me what it was, and I see ina minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, andwould make Jim just as free a man as mine would, andmaybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, andsaid we would waltz in on it. I needn't tell what itwas here, because I knowed it wouldn't stay the way, itwas. I knowed he would be changing it around everywhich way as we went along, and heaving in new bull-inesses wherever he got a chance. And that is whathe done.
Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that TomSawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to helpsteal that nigger out of slavery. That was the thingthat was too many for me. Here was a boy that wasrespectable and well brung up; and had a character tolose; and folks at home that had characters; and hewas bright and not leather-headed; and knowing andnot ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet herehe was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feel-ing, than to stoop to this business, and make himself ashame, and his family a shame, before everybody. ICOULDN'T understand it no way at all. It was outra-geous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so;and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thingright where he was and save himself. And I DID startto tell him; but he shut me up, and says:
"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about? Don'tI generly know what I'm about?"
"Yes."
"Didn't I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger?"
"Yes."
"WELL, then."
That's all he said, and that's all I said. It warn't nouse to say any more; because when he said he'd do athing, he always done it. But I couldn't make outhow he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let itgo, and never bothered no more about it. If he wasbound to have it so, I couldn't help it.
When we got home the house was all dark and still;so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper forto examine it. We went through the yard so as to seewhat the hounds would do. They knowed us, anddidn't make no more noise than country dogs is alwaysdoing when anything comes by in the night. Whenwe got to the cabin we took a look at the front and thetwo sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with --which was the north side -- we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailedacross it. I says:
"Here's the ticket. This hole's big enough for Jimto get through if we wrench off the board."
Tom says:
"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and aseasy as playing hooky. I should HOPE we can find away that's a little more complicated than THAT, HuckFinn."
"Well, then," I says, "how 'll it do to saw him out,the way I done before I was murdered that time?"
"That's more LIKE," he says. "It's real mysterious,and troublesome, and good," he says; "but I bet wecan find a way that's twice as long. There ain't nohurry; le's keep on looking around."
Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, wasa lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves, and was madeout of plank. It was as long as the hut, but narrow-- only about six foot wide. The door to it was at thesouth end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to thesoap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back theiron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it andprized out one of the staples. The chain fell down,and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, andstruck a match, and see the shed was only built againsta cabin and hadn't no connection with it; and therewarn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but someold rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks anda crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we,and shoved in the staple again, and the door was lockedas good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says;
"Now we're all right. We'll DIG him out. It 'lltake about a week!"
Then we started for the house, and I went in theback door -- you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors -- but that warn'tromantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would dohim but he must climb up the lightning-rod. But afterhe got up half way about three times, and missed fireand fell every time, and the last time most busted hisbrains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but afterhe was rested he allowed he would give her one moreturn for luck, and this time he made the trip.
In the morning we was up at break of day, and downto the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friendswith the nigger that fed Jim -- if it WAS Jim that wasbeing fed. The niggers was just getting through break-fast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger waspiling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things;and whilst the others was leaving, the key come fromthe house.
This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face,and his wool was all tied up in little bunches withthread. That was to keep witches off. He said thewitches was pestering him awful these nights, and mak-ing him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kindsof strange words and noises, and he didn't believe hewas ever witched so long before in his life. He gotso worked up, and got to running on so about histroubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going todo. So Tom says:
"What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?"
The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over hisface, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle,and he says:
"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur'us dog, too. Doesyou want to go en look at 'im?"
"Yes."
I hunched Tom, and whispers:
"You going, right here in the daybreak? THATwarn't the plan."
"No, it warn't; but it's the plan NOW."
So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like itmuch. When we got in we couldn't hardly see any-thing, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough,and could see us; and he sings out:
"Why, HUCK! En good LAN'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"
I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.I didn't know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn'ta done it, because that nigger busted in and says:
"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genl-men?"
We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked atthe nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says:
"Does WHO know us?"
"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger."
"I don't reckon he does; but what put that intoyour head?"
"What PUT it dar? Didn' he jis' dis minute singout like he knowed you?"
Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:
"Well, that's mighty curious. WHO sung out?WHEN did he sing out? WHAT did he sing out?"And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says, "DidYOU hear anybody sing out?"
Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the onething; so I says:
"No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing."
Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like henever see him before, and says:
"Did you sing out?"
"No, sah," says Jim; " I hain't said nothing, sah."
"Not a word?"
"No, sah, I hain't said a word."
"Did you ever see us before?"
"No, sah; not as I knows on."
So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wildand distressed, and says, kind of severe:
"What do you reckon's the matter with you, any-way? What made you think somebody sung out?"
"Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht Iwas dead, I do. Dey's awluz at it, sah, en dey domos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so. Please to don't tellnobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole me;'kase he say dey AIN'T no witches. I jis' wish to good-ness he was heah now -- DEN what would he say! Ijis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun' it DIS time.But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's SOT, stays sot; deywon't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, enwhen YOU fine it out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan'b'lieve you."
Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell no-body; and told him to buy some more thread to tie uphis wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says:
"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enoughto run away, I wouldn't give him up, I'd hang him."And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look atthe dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispersto Jim and says:
"Don't ever let on to know us. And if you hearany digging going on nights, it's us; we're going toset you free."
Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeezeit; then the nigger come back, and we said we'dcome again some time if the nigger wanted us to; andhe said he would, more particular if it was dark, be-cause the witches went for him mostly in the dark, andit was good to have folks around then.
