I was powerful lazy and comfortable -- didn't wantto get up and cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing offagain when I thinks I hears a deep sound of "boom!"away up the river. I rouses up, and rests on my elbowand listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hoppedup, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves,and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a longways up -- about abreast the ferry. And there wasthe ferryboat full of people floating along down. Iknowed what was the matter now. "Boom!" I seethe white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's side.You see, they was firing cannon over the water, tryingto make my carcass come to the top.
I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do forme to start a fire, because they might see the smoke.So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke andlistened to the boom. The river was a mile wide there,and it always looks pretty on a summer morning -- soI was having a good enough time seeing them hunt formy remainders if I only had a bite to eat. Well, thenI happened to think how they always put quicksilverin loaves of bread and float them off, because theyalways go right to the drownded carcass and stopthere. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if any ofthem's floating around after me I'll give them a show.I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see whatluck I could have, and I warn't disappointed. A bigdouble loaf come along, and I most got it with a longstick, but my foot slipped and she floated out further.Of course I was where the current set in the closest tothe shore -- I knowed enough for that. But by andby along comes another one, and this time I won. Itook out the plug and shook out the little dab of quick-silver, and set my teeth in. It was "baker's bread"-- what the quality eat; none of your low-downcorn-pone.
I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set thereon a log, munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And then somethingstruck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or theparson or somebody prayed that this bread would findme, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain'tno doubt but there is something in that thing -- that is,there's something in it when a body like the widow orthe parson prays, but it don't work for me, and Ireckon it don't work for only just the right kind.
I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and wenton watching. The ferryboat was floating with thecurrent, and I allowed I'd have a chance to see whowas aboard when she come along, because she wouldcome in close, where the bread did. When she'd gotpretty well along down towards me, I put out my pipeand went to where I fished out the bread, and laiddown behind a log on the bank in a little open place.Where the log forked I could peep through.
By and by she come along, and she drifted in soclose that they could a run out a plank and walkedashore. Most everybody was on the boat. Pap, andJudge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper,and Tom Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid andMary, and plenty more. Everybody was talking aboutthe murder, but the captain broke in and says:
"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closesthere, and maybe he's washed ashore and got tangledamongst the brush at the water's edge. I hope so,anyway."
"I didn't hope so. They all crowded up and leanedover the rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watch-ing with all their might. I could see them first-rate,but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out:
"Stand away!" and the cannon let off such a blastright before me that it made me deef with the noise andpretty near blind with the smoke, and I judged I wasgone. If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckonthey'd a got the corpse they was after. Well, I see Iwarn't hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated onand went out of sight around the shoulder of the island.I could hear the booming now and then, further andfurther off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hearit no more. The island was three mile long. I judgedthey had got to the foot, and was giving it up. Butthey didn't yet a while. They turned around the footof the island and started up the channel on the Mis-souri side, under steam, and booming once in a whileas they went. I crossed over to that side and watchedthem. When they got abreast the head of the islandthey quit shooting and dropped over to the Missourishore and went home to the town.
I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else wouldcome a-hunting after me. I got my traps out of thecanoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. Imade a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put mythings under so the rain couldn't get at them. Icatched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw,and towards sundown I started my camp fire and hadsupper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish forbreakfast.
When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking,and feeling pretty well satisfied; but by and by it gotsort of lonesome, and so I went and set on the bankand listened to the current swashing along, and countedthe stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, andthen went to bed; there ain't no better way to put intime when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, yousoon get over it.
And so for three days and nights. No difference --just the same thing. But the next day I went explor-ing around down through the island. I was boss of it;it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to knowall about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.I found plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and greensummer grapes, and green razberries; and the greenblackberries was just beginning to show. They wouldall come handy by and by, I judged.
Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till Ijudged I warn't far from the foot of the island. I hadmy gun along, but I hadn't shot nothing; it was forprotection; thought I would kill some game nighhome. About this time I mighty near stepped on agood-sized snake, and it went sliding off through thegrass and flowers, and I after it, trying to get a shot atit. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I boundedright on to the ashes of a camp fire that was stillsmoking.
My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I neverwaited for to look further, but uncocked my gun andwent sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever Icould. Every now and then I stopped a second amongstthe thick leaves and listened, but my breath come sohard I couldn't hear nothing else. I slunk along an-other piece further, then listened again; and so on,and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if Itrod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like aperson had cut one of my breaths in two and I onlygot half, and the short half, too.
When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash,there warn't much sand in my craw; but I says, thisain't no time to be fooling around. So I got all mytraps into my canoe again so as to have them out ofsight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashesaround to look like an old last year's camp, and thenclumb a tree.
I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but Ididn't see nothing, I didn't hear nothing -- I onlyTHOUGHT I heard and seen as much as a thousandthings. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so atlast I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and onthe lookout all the time. All I could get to eat wasberries and what was left over from breakfast.
By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. Sowhen it was good and dark I slid out from shore beforemoonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank -- abouta quarter of a mile. I went out in the woods andcooked a supper, and I had about made up my mindI would stay there all night when I hear a PLUNKETY-PLUNK, PLUNKETY-PLUNK, and says to myself, horsescoming; and next I hear people's voices. I goteverything into the canoe as quick as I could, and thenwent creeping through the woods to see what I couldfind out. I hadn't got far when I hear a man say:
"We better camp here if we can find a good place;the horses is about beat out. Let's look around."
I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled awayeasy. I tied up in the old place, and reckoned I wouldsleep in the canoe.
I didn't sleep much. I couldn't, somehow, forthinking. And every time I waked up I thoughtsomebody had me by the neck. So the sleep didn'tdo me no good. By and by I says to myself, I can'tlive this way; I'm a-going to find out who it is that'shere on the island with me; I'll find it out or bust.Well, I felt better right off.
So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just astep or two, and then let the canoe drop along downamongst the shadows. The moon was shining, and out-side of the shadows it made it most as light as day. Ipoked along well on to an hour, everything still asrocks and sound asleep. Well, by this time I wasmost down to the foot of the island. A little ripply,cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good assaying the night was about done. I give her a turnwith the paddle and brung her nose to shore; then Igot my gun and slipped out and into the edge of thewoods. I sat down there on a log, and looked outthrough the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, andthe darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a littlewhile I see a pale streak over the treetops, and knowedthe day was coming. So I took my gun and slippedoff towards where I had run across that camp fire,stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn'tno luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the place.But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse offire away through the trees. I went for it, cautiousand slow. By and by I was close enough to have alook, and there laid a man on the ground. It mostgive me the fantods. He had a blanket around hishead, and his head was nearly in the fire. I set therebehind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him,and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting graydaylight now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretchedhimself and hove off the blanket, and it was MissWatson's Jim! I bet I was glad to see him. I says:
"Hello, Jim!" and skipped out.
He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then hedrops down on his knees, and puts his hands togetherand says:
"Doan' hurt me -- don't! I hain't ever done noharm to a ghos'. I alwuz liked dead people, en doneall I could for 'em. You go en git in de river agin,whah you b'longs, en doan' do nuffn to Ole Jim, 'at'uz awluz yo' fren'."
Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn'tdead. I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn't lone-some now. I told him I warn't afraid of HIM tellingthe people where I was. I talked along, but he onlyset there and looked at me; never said nothing. ThenI says:
"It's good daylight. Le's get breakfast. Make upyour camp fire good."
"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cookstrawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain'tyou? Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries."
"Strawberries and such truck," I says. "Is thatwhat you live on?"
"I couldn' git nuffn else," he says.
"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?"
"I come heah de night arter you's killed."
"What, all that time?"
"Yes -- indeedy."
"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rub-bage to eat?"
"No, sah -- nuffn else."
"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?"
"I reck'n I could eat a hoss. I think I could.How long you ben on de islan'?"
"Since the night I got killed."
"No! W'y, what has you lived on? But you gota gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat's good. Nowyou kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire."
So we went over to where the canoe was, and whilehe built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees,I fetched meal and bacon and coffee, and coffee-potand frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the niggerwas set back considerable, because he reckoned it wasall done with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish,too, and Jim cleaned him with his knife, and friedhim.
When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass andeat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might,for he was most about starved. Then when we hadgot pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied.By and by Jim says:
"But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat 'uz killedin dat shanty ef it warn't you?"
Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it wassmart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up no betterplan than what I had. Then I says:
"How do you come to be here, Jim, and how'd youget here?"
He looked pretty uneasy, and didn't say nothing fora minute. Then he says:
"Maybe I better not tell."
"Why, Jim?"
"Well, dey's reasons. But you wouldn' tell on meef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?"
"Blamed if I would, Jim."
"Well, I b'lieve you, Huck. I -- I RUN OFF."
"Jim!"
"But mind, you said you wouldn' tell -- you knowyou said you wouldn' tell, Huck."
"Well, I did. I said I wouldn't, and I'll stick to it.Honest INJUN, I will. People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum --but that don't make no difference. I ain't a-going totell, and I ain't a-going back there, anyways. So,now, le's know all about it."
"Well, you see, it 'uz dis way. Ole missus -- dat'sMiss Watson -- she pecks on me all de time, en treatsme pooty rough, but she awluz said she wouldn' sellme down to Orleans. But I noticed dey wuz a niggertrader roun' de place considable lately, en I begin togit oneasy. Well, one night I creeps to de do' pootylate, en de do' warn't quite shet, en I hear old missustell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans,but she didn' want to, but she could git eight hund'ddollars for me, en it 'uz sich a big stack o' money shecouldn' resis'. De widder she try to git her to sayshe wouldn' do it, but I never waited to hear de res'.I lit out mighty quick, I tell you.
"I tuck out en shin down de hill, en 'spec to steal askift 'long de sho' som'ers 'bove de town, but dey wuzpeople a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-downcooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go'way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebodyroun' all de time. 'Long 'bout six in de mawnin'skifts begin to go by, en 'bout eight er nine everyskift dat went 'long wuz talkin' 'bout how yo' papcome over to de town en say you's killed. Dese las'skifts wuz full o' ladies en genlmen a-goin' over for tosee de place. Sometimes dey'd pull up at de sho' entake a res' b'fo' dey started acrost, so by de talk I gotto know all 'bout de killin'. I 'uz powerful sorryyou's killed, Huck, but I ain't no mo' now.
"I laid dah under de shavin's all day. I 'uzhungry, but I warn't afeard; bekase I knowed olemissus en de widder wuz goin' to start to de camp-meet'n' right arter breakfas' en be gone all day, endey knows I goes off wid de cattle 'bout daylight, sodey wouldn' 'spec to see me roun' de place, en so deywouldn' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin'. Deyuther servants wouldn' miss me, kase dey'd shin outen take holiday soon as de ole folks 'uz out'n de way.
"Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de riverroad, en went 'bout two mile er more to whah deywarn't no houses. I'd made up my mine 'bout whatI's agwyne to do. You see, ef I kep' on tryin' to gitaway afoot, de dogs 'ud track me; ef I stole a skift tocross over, dey'd miss dat skift, you see, en dey'dknow 'bout whah I'd lan' on de yuther side, en whahto pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I'sarter; it doan' MAKE no track.
"I see a light a-comin' roun' de p'int bymeby, so Iwade' in en shove' a log ahead o' me en swum more'nhalf way acrost de river, en got in 'mongst de drift-wood, en kep' my head down low, en kinder swumagin de current tell de raff come along. Den I swumto de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en 'uzpooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laiddown on de planks. De men 'uz all 'way yonder inde middle, whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin', en dey wuz a good current; so I reck'n'd 'atby fo' in de mawnin' I'd be twenty-five mile down deriver, en den I'd slip in jis b'fo' daylight en swimasho', en take to de woods on de Illinois side.
"But I didn' have no luck. When we 'uz mos'down to de head er de islan' a man begin to come aftwid de lantern, I see it warn't no use fer to wait, so Islid overboard en struck out fer de islan'. Well, I hada notion I could lan' mos' anywhers, but I couldn't --bank too bluff. I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan'b'fo' I found' a good place. I went into de woods enjedged I wouldn' fool wid raffs no mo', long as deymove de lantern roun' so. I had my pipe en a plug erdog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn'twet, so I 'uz all right."
"And so you ain't had no meat nor bread to eat allthis time? Why didn't you get mud-turkles?"
"How you gwyne to git 'm? You can't slip up onum en grab um; en how's a body gwyne to hit umwid a rock? How could a body do it in de night?En I warn't gwyne to show mysef on de bank in dedaytime."
"Well, that's so. You've had to keep in the woodsall the time, of course. Did you hear 'em shootingthe cannon?"
"Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see umgo by heah -- watched um thoo de bushes."
Some young birds come along, flying a yard or twoat a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it wasgoing to rain. He said it was a sign when youngchickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was thesame way when young birds done it. I was going tocatch some of them, but Jim wouldn't let me. Hesaid it was death. He said his father laid mighty sickonce, and some of them catched a bird, and his oldgranny said his father would die, and he did.
And Jim said you mustn't count the things you aregoing to cook for dinner, because that would bringbad luck. The same if you shook the table-cloth aftersundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive andthat man died, the bees must be told about it beforesun-up next morning, or else the bees would allweaken down and quit work and die. Jim said beeswouldn't sting idiots; but I didn't believe that, be-cause I had tried them lots of times myself, and theywouldn't sting me.
I had heard about some of these things before, butnot all of them. Jim knowed all kinds of signs. Hesaid he knowed most everything. I said it looked tome like all the signs was about bad luck, and so Iasked him if there warn't any good-luck signs. Hesays:
"Mighty few -- an' DEY ain't no use to a body.What you want to know when good luck's a-comin'for? Want to keep it off?" And he said: "Ef you'sgot hairy arms en a hairy breas', it's a sign dat you'sagwyne to be rich. Well, dey's some use in a signlike dat, 'kase it's so fur ahead. You see, maybeyou's got to be po' a long time fust, en so you mightgit discourage' en kill yo'sef 'f you didn' know by design dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby."
"Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast,Jim?"
"What's de use to ax dat question? Don't yousee I has?"
"Well, are you rich?"
"No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be richagin. Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck tospecalat'n', en got busted out."
"What did you speculate in, Jim?"
"Well, fust I tackled stock."
"What kind of stock?"
"Why, live stock -- cattle, you know. I put tendollars in a cow. But I ain' gwyne to resk no mo'money in stock. De cow up 'n' died on my han's."
"So you lost the ten dollars."
"No, I didn't lose it all. I on'y los' 'bout nine ofit. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents."
"You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did youspeculate any more?"
"Yes. You know that one-laigged nigger datb'longs to old Misto Bradish? Well, he sot up abank, en say anybody dat put in a dollar would git fo'dollars mo' at de en' er de year. Well, all de niggerswent in, but dey didn't have much. I wuz de on'yone dat had much. So I stuck out for mo' dan fo'dollars, en I said 'f I didn' git it I'd start a bank my-sef. Well, o' course dat nigger want' to keep me outer de business, bekase he says dey warn't business'nough for two banks, so he say I could put in my fivedollars en he pay me thirty-five at de en' er de year.
"So I done it. Den I reck'n'd I'd inves' dethirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin'.Dey wuz a nigger name' Bob, dat had ketched a wood-flat, en his marster didn' know it; en I bought it off'nhim en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when deen' er de year come; but somebody stole de wood-flatdat night, en nex day de one-laigged nigger say debank's busted. So dey didn' none uv us git nomoney."
"What did you do with the ten cents, Jim?"
"Well, I 'uz gwyne to spen' it, but I had a dream,en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name'Balum -- Balum's Ass dey call him for short; he'sone er dem chuckleheads, you know. But he's lucky,dey say, en I see I warn't lucky. De dream say letBalum inves' de ten cents en he'd make a raise for me.Well, Balum he tuck de money, en when he wuz inchurch he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to depo' len' to de Lord, en boun' to git his money back ahund'd times. So Balum he tuck en give de ten centsto de po', en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to comeof it."
"Well, what did come of it, Jim?"
"Nuffn never come of it. I couldn' manage tok'leck dat money no way; en Balum he couldn'. Iain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see desecurity. Boun' to git yo' money back a hund'dtimes, de preacher says! Ef I could git de ten CENTSback, I'd call it squah, en be glad er de chanst."
"Well, it's all right anyway, Jim, long as you'regoing to be rich again some time or other."
"Yes; en I's rich now, come to look at it. I ownsmysef, en I's wuth eight hund'd dollars. I wisht Ihad de money, I wouldn' want no mo'."
