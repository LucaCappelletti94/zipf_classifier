We can secure other people's approval, if we do right and try hard; butour own is worth a hundred of it, and no way has been found out ofsecuring that. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
My health had broken down in New York in May; it had remained in adoubtful but fairish condition during a succeeding period of 82 days; itbroke again on the Pacific. It broke again in Sydney, but not untilafter I had had a good outing, and had also filled my lectureengagements. This latest break lost me the chance of seeing Queensland.In the circumstances, to go north toward hotter weather was notadvisable.
So we moved south with a westward slant, 17 hours by rail to the capitalof the colony of Victoria, Melbourne--that juvenile city of sixty years,and half a million inhabitants. On the map the distance looked small;but that is a trouble with all divisions of distance in such a vastcountry as Australia. The colony of Victoria itself looks small on themap--looks like a county, in fact--yet it is about as large as England,Scotland, and Wales combined. Or, to get another focus upon it, it isjust 80 times as large as the state of Rhode Island, and one-third aslarge as the State of Texas.
Outside of Melbourne, Victoria seems to be owned by a handful ofsquatters, each with a Rhode Island for a sheep farm. That is theimpression which one gathers from common talk, yet the wool industry ofVictoria is by no means so great as that of New South Wales. The climateof Victoria is favorable to other great industries--among others,wheat-growing and the making of wine.
We took the train at Sydney at about four in the afternoon. It wasAmerican in one way, for we had a most rational sleeping car; also thecar was clean and fine and new--nothing about it to suggest the rollingstock of the continent of Europe. But our baggage was weighed, and extraweight charged for. That was continental. Continental and troublesome.Any detail of railroading that is not troublesome cannot honorably bedescribed as continental.
The tickets were round-trip ones--to Melbourne, and clear to Adelaide inSouth Australia, and then all the way back to Sydney. Twelve hundredmore miles than we really expected to make; but then as the round tripwouldn't cost much more than the single trip, it seemed well enough tobuy as many miles as one could afford, even if one was not likely to needthem. A human being has a natural desire to have more of a good thingthan he needs.
Now comes a singular thing: the oddest thing, the strangest thing, themost baffling and unaccountable marvel that Australasia can show. At thefrontier between New South Wales and Victoria our multitude of passengerswere routed out of their snug beds by lantern-light in the morning in thebiting-cold of a high altitude to change cars on a road that has no breakin it from Sydney to Melbourne! Think of the paralysis of intellect thatgave that idea birth; imagine the boulder it emerged from on somepetrified legislator's shoulders.
It is a narrow-gage road to the frontier, and a broader gauge thence toMelbourne. The two governments were the builders of the road and are theowners of it. One or two reasons are given for this curious state ofthings. One is, that it represents the jealousy existing between thecolonies--the two most important colonies of Australasia. What the otherone is, I have forgotten. But it is of no consequence. It could be butanother effort to explain the inexplicable.
All passengers fret at the double-gauge; all shippers of freight must ofcourse fret at it; unnecessary expense, delay, and annoyance are imposedupon everybody concerned, and no one is benefitted.
Each Australian colony fences itself off from its neighbor with acustom-house. Personally, I have no objection, but it must be a gooddeal of inconvenience to the people. We have something resembling ithere and there in America, but it goes by another name. The large empireof the Pacific coast requires a world of iron machinery, and couldmanufacture it economically on the spot if the imposts on foreign ironwere removed. But they are not. Protection to Pennsylvania and Alabamaforbids it. The result to the Pacific coast is the same as if there wereseveral rows of custom-fences between the coast and the East. Ironcarted across the American continent at luxurious railway rates would bevaluable enough to be coined when it arrived.
We changed cars. This was at Albury. And it was there, I think, thatthe growing day and the early sun exposed the distant range called theBlue Mountains. Accurately named. "My word!" as the Australians say,but it was a stunning color, that blue. Deep, strong, rich, exquisite;towering and majestic masses of blue--a softly luminous blue, asmouldering blue, as if vaguely lit by fires within. It extinguished theblue of the sky--made it pallid and unwholesome, whitey and washed-out.A wonderful color--just divine.
A resident told me that those were not mountains; he said they wererabbit-piles. And explained that long exposure and the over-ripecondition of the rabbits was what made them look so blue. This man mayhave been right, but much reading of books of travel has made medistrustful of gratis information furnished by unofficial residents of acountry. The facts which such people give to travelers are usuallyerroneous, and often intemperately so. The rabbit-plague has indeed beenvery bad in Australia, and it could account for one mountain, but not fora mountain range, it seems to me. It is too large an order.
We breakfasted at the station. A good breakfast, except the coffee; andcheap. The Government establishes the prices and placards them. Thewaiters were men, I think; but that is not usual in Australasia. Theusual thing is to have girls. No, not girls, young ladies--generallyduchesses. Dress? They would attract attention at any royal levee inEurope. Even empresses and queens do not dress as they do. Not thatthey could not afford it, perhaps, but they would not know how.
All the pleasant morning we slid smoothly along over the plains, throughthin--not thick--forests of great melancholy gum trees, with trunksrugged with curled sheets of flaking bark--erysipelas convalescents, soto speak, shedding their dead skins. And all along were tiny cabins,built sometimes of wood, sometimes of gray-blue corrugated iron; andthe doorsteps and fences were clogged with children--rugged littlesimply-clad chaps that looked as if they had been imported from thebanks of the Mississippi without breaking bulk.
And there were little villages, with neat stations well placarded withshowy advertisements--mainly of almost too self-righteous brands of"sheepdip." If that is the name--and I think it is. It is a stuff liketar, and is dabbed on to places where the shearer clips a piece out ofthe sheep. It bars out the flies, and has healing properties, and a nipto it which makes the sheep skip like the cattle on a thousand hills. Itis not good to eat. That is, it is not good to eat except when mixedwith railroad coffee. It improves railroad coffee. Without it railroadcoffee is too vague. But with it, it is quite assertive andenthusiastic. By itself, railroad coffee is too passive; but sheep-dipmakes it wake up and get down to business. I wonder where they getrailroad coffee?
We saw birds, but not a kangaroo, not an emu, not an ornithorhynchus, nota lecturer, not a native. Indeed, the land seemed quite destitute ofgame. But I have misused the word native. In Australia it is applied toAustralian-born whites only. I should have said that we saw noAboriginals--no "blackfellows." And to this day I have never seen one.In the great museums you will find all the other curiosities, but in thecurio of chiefest interest to the stranger all of them are lacking. Wehave at home an abundance of museums, and not an American Indian in them.It is clearly an absurdity, but it never struck me before.
