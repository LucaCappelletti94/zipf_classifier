  A wind comes from the north	Blowing little flocks of birds	Like spray across the town,	And a train, roaring forth,	Rushes stampeding down With cries and flying curds	Of steam, out of the darkening north.	 Whither I turn and set	Like a needle steadfastly,	Waiting ever to get The news that she is free;	But ever fixed, as yet,	To the lode of her agony.
