The next morning we were up and dressed at ten o'clock. We went to the'commissionaire' of the hotel--I don't know what a 'commissionaire' is,but that is the man we went to--and told him we wanted a guide. He saidthe national Exposition had drawn such multitudes of Englishmen andAmericans to Paris that it would be next to impossible to find a goodguide unemployed. He said he usually kept a dozen or two on hand, but heonly had three now. He called them. One looked so like a very piratethat we let him go at once. The next one spoke with a simperingprecision of pronunciation that was irritating and said:
"If ze zhentlemans will to me make ze grande honneur to me rattain inhees serveece, I shall show to him every sing zat is magnifique to lookupon in ze beautiful Parree. I speaky ze Angleesh pairfaitemaw."
He would have done well to have stopped there, because he had that muchby heart and said it right off without making a mistake. But hisself-complacency seduced him into attempting a flight into regions ofunexplored English, and the reckless experiment was his ruin. Within tenseconds he was so tangled up in a maze of mutilated verbs and torn andbleeding forms of speech that no human ingenuity could ever have gottenhim out of it with credit. It was plain enough that he could not"speaky" the English quite as "pairfaitemaw" as he had pretended hecould.
The third man captured us. He was plainly dressed, but he had anoticeable air of neatness about him. He wore a high silk hat which wasa little old, but had been carefully brushed. He wore second-hand kidgloves, in good repair, and carried a small rattan cane with a curvedhandle--a female leg--of ivory. He stepped as gently and as daintily asa cat crossing a muddy street; and oh, he was urbanity; he was quiet,unobtrusive self-possession; he was deference itself! He spoke softlyand guardedly; and when he was about to make a statement on his soleresponsibility or offer a suggestion, he weighed it by drachms andscruples first, with the crook of his little stick placed meditatively tohis teeth. His opening speech was perfect. It was perfect inconstruction, in phraseology, in grammar, in emphasis, in pronunciation--everything. He spoke little and guardedly after that. We were charmed.We were more than charmed--we were overjoyed. We hired him at once. Wenever even asked him his price. This man--our lackey, our servant, ourunquestioning slave though he was--was still a gentleman--we could seethat--while of the other two one was coarse and awkward and the other wasa born pirate. We asked our man Friday's name. He drew from hispocketbook a snowy little card and passed it to us with a profound bow:
 A. BILLFINGER, Guide to Paris, France, Germany, Spain, &c., &c. Grande Hotel du Louvre.
"Billfinger! Oh, carry me home to die!"
That was an "aside" from Dan. The atrocious name grated harshly on myear, too. The most of us can learn to forgive, and even to like, acountenance that strikes us unpleasantly at first, but few of us, Ifancy, become reconciled to a jarring name so easily. I was almost sorrywe had hired this man, his name was so unbearable. However, no matter.We were impatient to start. Billfinger stepped to the door to call acarriage, and then the doctor said:
"Well, the guide goes with the barbershop, with the billiard-table, withthe gasless room, and may be with many another pretty romance of Paris.I expected to have a guide named Henri de Montmorency, or Armand de laChartreuse, or something that would sound grand in letters to thevillagers at home, but to think of a Frenchman by the name of Billfinger!Oh! This is absurd, you know. This will never do. We can't sayBillfinger; it is nauseating. Name him over again; what had we bettercall him? Alexis du Caulaincourt?"
"Alphonse Henri Gustave de Hauteville," I suggested.
"Call him Ferguson," said Dan.
That was practical, unromantic good sense. Without debate, we expungedBillfinger as Billfinger, and called him Ferguson.
The carriage--an open barouche--was ready. Ferguson mounted beside thedriver, and we whirled away to breakfast. As was proper, Mr. Fergusonstood by to transmit our orders and answer questions. By and by, hementioned casually--the artful adventurer--that he would go and get hisbreakfast as soon as we had finished ours. He knew we could not getalong without him and that we would not want to loiter about and wait forhim. We asked him to sit down and eat with us. He begged, with many abow, to be excused. It was not proper, he said; he would sit at anothertable. We ordered him peremptorily to sit down with us.
Here endeth the first lesson. It was a mistake.
As long as we had that fellow after that, he was always hungry; he wasalways thirsty. He came early; he stayed late; he could not pass arestaurant; he looked with a lecherous eye upon every wine shop.Suggestions to stop, excuses to eat and to drink, were forever on hislips. We tried all we could to fill him so full that he would have noroom to spare for a fortnight, but it was a failure. He did not holdenough to smother the cravings of his superhuman appetite.
He had another "discrepancy" about him. He was always wanting us to buythings. On the shallowest pretenses he would inveigle us into shirtstores, boot stores, tailor shops, glove shops--anywhere under the broadsweep of the heavens that there seemed a chance of our buying anything.Anyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a percentage onthe sales, but in our blessed innocence we didn't until this feature ofhis conduct grew unbearably prominent. One day Dan happened to mentionthat he thought of buying three or four silk dress patterns for presents.Ferguson's hungry eye was upon him in an instant. In the course oftwenty minutes the carriage stopped.
"What's this?"
"Zis is ze finest silk magazin in Paris--ze most celebrate."
"What did you come here for? We told you to take us to the palace of theLouvre."
"I suppose ze gentleman say he wish to buy some silk."
"You are not required to 'suppose' things for the party, Ferguson. We donot wish to tax your energies too much. We will bear some of the burdenand heat of the day ourselves. We will endeavor to do such 'supposing'as is really necessary to be done. Drive on." So spake the doctor.
Within fifteen minutes the carriage halted again, and before another silkstore. The doctor said:
"Ah, the palace of the Louvre--beautiful, beautiful edifice! Does theEmperor Napoleon live here now, Ferguson?"
"Ah, Doctor! You do jest; zis is not ze palace; we come there directly.But since we pass right by zis store, where is such beautiful silk--"
"Ah! I see, I see. I meant to have told you that we did not wish topurchase any silks to-day, but in my absent-mindedness I forgot it. Ialso meant to tell you we wished to go directly to the Louvre, but Iforgot that also. However, we will go there now. Pardon my seemingcarelessness, Ferguson. Drive on."
Within the half hour we stopped again--in front of another silk store.We were angry; but the doctor was always serene, always smooth-voiced.He said:
"At last! How imposing the Louvre is, and yet how small! Howexquisitely fashioned! How charmingly situated!--Venerable, venerablepile--"
"Pairdon, Doctor, zis is not ze Louvre--it is--"
"What is it?"
"I have ze idea--it come to me in a moment--zat ze silk in zis magazin--"
"Ferguson, how heedless I am. I fully intended to tell you that we didnot wish to buy any silks to-day, and I also intended to tell you that weyearned to go immediately to the palace of the Louvre, but enjoying thehappiness of seeing you devour four breakfasts this morning has so filledme with pleasurable emotions that I neglect the commonest interests ofthe time. However, we will proceed now to the Louvre, Ferguson."
"But, doctor," (excitedly,) "it will take not a minute--not but one smallminute! Ze gentleman need not to buy if he not wish to--but only look atze silk--look at ze beautiful fabric. [Then pleadingly.] Sair--just onlyone leetle moment!"
Dan said, "Confound the idiot! I don't want to see any silks today, andI won't look at them. Drive on."
And the doctor: "We need no silks now, Ferguson. Our hearts yearn forthe Louvre. Let us journey on--let us journey on."
"But doctor! It is only one moment--one leetle moment. And ze time willbe save--entirely save! Because zere is nothing to see now--it is toolate. It want ten minute to four and ze Louvre close at four--only oneleetle moment, Doctor!"
The treacherous miscreant! After four breakfasts and a gallon ofchampagne, to serve us such a scurvy trick. We got no sight of thecountless treasures of art in the Louvre galleries that day, and our onlypoor little satisfaction was in the reflection that Ferguson sold not asolitary silk dress pattern.
I am writing this chapter partly for the satisfaction of abusing thataccomplished knave Billfinger, and partly to show whosoever shall readthis how Americans fare at the hands of the Paris guides and what sort ofpeople Paris guides are. It need not be supposed that we were a stupideror an easier prey than our countrymen generally are, for we were not.The guides deceive and defraud every American who goes to Paris for thefirst time and sees its sights alone or in company with others as littleexperienced as himself. I shall visit Paris again someday, and then letthe guides beware! I shall go in my war paint--I shall carry my tomahawkalong.
I think we have lost but little time in Paris. We have gone to bed everynight tired out. Of course we visited the renowned InternationalExposition. All the world did that. We went there on our third day inParis--and we stayed there nearly two hours. That was our first and lastvisit. To tell the truth, we saw at a glance that one would have tospend weeks--yea, even months--in that monstrous establishment to get anintelligible idea of it. It was a wonderful show, but the moving massesof people of all nations we saw there were a still more wonderful show.I discovered that if I were to stay there a month, I should still findmyself looking at the people instead of the inanimate objects onexhibition. I got a little interested in some curious old tapestries ofthe thirteenth century, but a party of Arabs came by, and their duskyfaces and quaint costumes called my attention away at once. I watched asilver swan, which had a living grace about his movements and a livingintelligence in his eyes--watched him swimming about as comfortably andas unconcernedly as if he had been born in a morass instead of ajeweler's shop--watched him seize a silver fish from under the water andhold up his head and go through all the customary and elaborate motionsof swallowing it--but the moment it disappeared down his throat sometattooed South Sea Islanders approached and I yielded to theirattractions.
Presently I found a revolving pistol several hundred years old whichlooked strangely like a modern Colt, but just then I heard that theEmpress of the French was in another part of the building, and hastenedaway to see what she might look like. We heard martial music--we saw anunusual number of soldiers walking hurriedly about--there was a generalmovement among the people. We inquired what it was all about and learnedthat the Emperor of the French and the Sultan of Turkey were about toreview twenty-five thousand troops at the Arc de l'Etoile. Weimmediately departed. I had a greater anxiety to see these men than Icould have had to see twenty expositions.
We drove away and took up a position in an open space opposite theAmerican minister's house. A speculator bridged a couple of barrels witha board and we hired standing places on it. Presently there was a soundof distant music; in another minute a pillar of dust came moving slowlytoward us; a moment more and then, with colors flying and a grand crashof military music, a gallant array of cavalrymen emerged from the dustand came down the street on a gentle trot. After them came a long lineof artillery; then more cavalry, in splendid uniforms; and then theirimperial majesties Napoleon III and Abdul Aziz. The vast concourse ofpeople swung their hats and shouted--the windows and housetops in thewide vicinity burst into a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs, and thewavers of the same mingled their cheers with those of the masses below.It was a stirring spectacle.
But the two central figures claimed all my attention. Was ever such acontrast set up before a multitude till then? Napoleon in militaryuniform--a long-bodied, short-legged man, fiercely moustached, old,wrinkled, with eyes half closed, and such a deep, crafty, schemingexpression about them!--Napoleon, bowing ever so gently to the loudplaudits, and watching everything and everybody with his cat eyes fromunder his depressed hat brim, as if to discover any sign that thosecheers were not heartfelt and cordial.
Abdul Aziz, absolute lord of the Ottoman empire--clad in dark greenEuropean clothes, almost without ornament or insignia of rank; a redTurkish fez on his head; a short, stout, dark man, black-bearded,black-eyed, stupid, unprepossessing--a man whose whole appearancesomehow suggested that if he only had a cleaver in his hand and a whiteapron on, one would not be at all surprised to hear him say: "A muttonroast today, or will you have a nice porterhouse steak?"
Napoleon III, the representative of the highest modern civilization,progress, and refinement; Abdul-Aziz, the representative of a people bynature and training filthy, brutish, ignorant, unprogressive,superstitious--and a government whose Three Graces are Tyranny, Rapacity,Blood. Here in brilliant Paris, under this majestic Arch of Triumph, theFirst Century greets the Nineteenth!
NAPOLEON III., Emperor of France! Surrounded by shouting thousands, bymilitary pomp, by the splendors of his capital city, and companioned bykings and princes--this is the man who was sneered at and reviled andcalled Bastard--yet who was dreaming of a crown and an empire all thewhile; who was driven into exile--but carried his dreams with him; whoassociated with the common herd in America and ran foot races for awager--but still sat upon a throne in fancy; who braved every danger togo to his dying mother--and grieved that she could not be spared to seehim cast aside his plebeian vestments for the purple of royalty; who kepthis faithful watch and walked his weary beat a common policeman ofLondon--but dreamed the while of a coming night when he should tread thelong-drawn corridors of the Tuileries; who made the miserable fiasco ofStrasbourg; saw his poor, shabby eagle, forgetful of its lesson, refuseto perch upon his shoulder; delivered his carefully prepared, sententiousburst of eloquence upon unsympathetic ears; found himself a prisoner, thebutt of small wits, a mark for the pitiless ridicule of all the world--yet went on dreaming of coronations and splendid pageants as before; wholay a forgotten captive in the dungeons of Ham--and still schemed andplanned and pondered over future glory and future power; President ofFrance at last! a coup d'etat, and surrounded by applauding armies,welcomed by the thunders of cannon, he mounts a throne and waves beforean astounded world the sceptre of a mighty empire! Who talks of themarvels of fiction? Who speaks of the wonders of romance? Who prates ofthe tame achievements of Aladdin and the Magii of Arabia?
ABDUL-AZIZ, Sultan of Turkey, Lord of the Ottoman Empire! Born to athrone; weak, stupid, ignorant, almost, as his meanest slave; chief of avast royalty, yet the puppet of his Premier and the obedient child of atyrannical mother; a man who sits upon a throne--the beck of whose fingermoves navies and armies--who holds in his hands the power of life anddeath over millions--yet who sleeps, sleeps, eats, eats, idles with hiseight hundred concubines, and when he is surfeited with eating andsleeping and idling, and would rouse up and take the reins of governmentand threaten to be a sultan, is charmed from his purpose by wary FuadPacha with a pretty plan for a new palace or a new ship--charmed awaywith a new toy, like any other restless child; a man who sees his peoplerobbed and oppressed by soulless tax-gatherers, but speaks no word tosave them; who believes in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of TheArabian Nights, but has small regard for the mighty magicians of to-day,and is nervous in the presence of their mysterious railroads andsteamboats and telegraphs; who would see undone in Egypt all that greatMehemet Ali achieved, and would prefer rather to forget than emulate him;a man who found his great empire a blot upon the earth--a degraded,poverty-stricken, miserable, infamous agglomeration of ignorance, crime,and brutality--and will idle away the allotted days of his trivial lifeand then pass to the dust and the worms and leave it so!
Napoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of France in ten yearsto such a degree that figures can hardly compute it. He has rebuiltParis and has partly rebuilt every city in the state. He condemns awhole street at a time, assesses the damages, pays them, and rebuildssuperbly. Then speculators buy up the ground and sell, but the originalowner is given the first choice by the government at a stated pricebefore the speculator is permitted to purchase. But above all things, hehas taken the sole control of the empire of France into his hands andmade it a tolerably free land--for people who will not attempt to go toofar in meddling with government affairs. No country offers greatersecurity to life and property than France, and one has all the freedom hewants, but no license--no license to interfere with anybody or makeanyone uncomfortable.
As for the Sultan, one could set a trap any where and catch a dozen ablermen in a night.
The bands struck up, and the brilliant adventurer, Napoleon III., thegenius of Energy, Persistence, Enterprise; and the feeble Abdul-Aziz, thegenius of Ignorance, Bigotry, and Indolence, prepared for the Forward--March!
We saw the splendid review, we saw the white-moustached old Crimeansoldier, Canrobert, Marshal of France, we saw--well, we saw every thing,and then we went home satisfied.
