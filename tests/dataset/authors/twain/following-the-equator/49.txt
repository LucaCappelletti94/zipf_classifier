He had had much experience of physicians, and said "the only way to keepyour health is to eat what you don't want, drink what; you don't like,and do what you'd druther not." --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
It was a long journey--two nights, one day, and part of another day, fromBombay eastward to Allahabad; but it was always interesting, and it wasnot fatiguing. At first the night travel promised to be fatiguing, butthat was on account of pyjamas. This foolish night-dress consists ofjacket and drawers. Sometimes they are made of silk, sometimes of araspy, scratchy, slazy woolen material with a sandpaper surface. Thedrawers are loose elephant-legged and elephant-waisted things, andinstead of buttoning around the body there is a drawstring to produce therequired shrinkage. The jacket is roomy, and one buttons it in front.Pyjamas are hot on a hot night and cold on a cold night--defects which anightshirt is free from. I tried the pyjamas in order to be in thefashion; but I was obliged to give them up, I couldn't stand them. Therewas no sufficient change from day-gear to night-gear. I missed therefreshing and luxurious sense, induced by the night-gown, of beingundressed, emancipated, set free from restraints and trammels. In placeof that, I had the worried, confined, oppressed, suffocated sense ofbeing abed with my clothes on. All through the warm half of the nightthe coarse surfaces irritated my skin and made it feel baked andfeverish, and the dreams which came in the fitful flurries of slumberwere such as distress the sleep of the damned, or ought to; and allthrough the cold other half of the night I could get no time for sleepbecause I had to employ it all in stealing blankets. But blankets are ofno value at such a time; the higher they are piled the more effectivelythey cork the cold in and keep it from getting out. The result is thatyour legs are ice, and you know how you will feel by and by when you areburied. In a sane interval I discarded the pyjamas, and led a rationaland comfortable life thenceforth.
Out in the country in India, the day begins early. One sees a plain,perfectly flat, dust-colored and brick-yardy, stretching limitlessly awayon every side in the dim gray light, striped everywhere with hard-beatennarrow paths, the vast flatness broken at wide intervals by bunches ofspectral trees that mark where villages are; and along all the paths areslender women and the black forms of lanky naked men moving, to theirwork, the women with brass water-jars on their heads, the men carryinghoes. The man is not entirely naked; always there is a bit of white rag,a loin-cloth; it amounts to a bandage, and is a white accent on his blackperson, like the silver band around the middle of a pipe-stem. Sometimeshe also wears a fluffy and voluminous white turban, and this adds asecond accent. He then answers properly to Miss Gordon Cumming'sflash-light picture of him--as a person who is dressed in "a turbanand a pocket handkerchief."
All day long one has this monotony of dust-colored dead levels andscattering bunches of trees and mud villages. You soon realize thatIndia is not beautiful; still there is an enchantment about it that isbeguiling, and which does not pall. You cannot tell just what it is thatmakes the spell, perhaps, but you feel it and confess it, nevertheless.Of course, at bottom, you know in a vague way that it is history; it isthat that affects you, a haunting sense of the myriads of human livesthat have blossomed, and withered, and perished here, repeating andrepeating and repeating, century after century, and age after age, thebarren and meaningless process; it is this sense that gives to thisforlorn, uncomely land power to speak to the spirit and make friends withit; to, speak to it with a voice bitter with satire, but eloquent withmelancholy. The deserts of Australia and the ice-barrens of Greenlandhave no speech, for they have no venerable history; with nothing to tellof man and his vanities, his fleeting glories and his miseries, they havenothing wherewith to spiritualize their ugliness and veil it with acharm.
There is nothing pretty about an Indian village--a mud one--and I do notremember that we saw any but mud ones on that long flight to Allahabad.It is a little bunch of dirt-colored mud hovels jammed together within amud wall. As a rule, the rains had beaten down parts of some of thehouses, and this gave the village the aspect of a mouldering and hoaryruin. I believe the cattle and the vermin live inside the wall; for Isaw cattle coming out and cattle going in; and whenever I saw a villager,he was scratching. This last is only circumstantial evidence, but Ithink it has value. The village has a battered little temple or two, bigenough to hold an idol, and with custom enough to fat-up a priest andkeep him comfortable. Where there are Mohammedans there are generally afew sorry tombs outside the village that have a decayed and neglectedlook. The villages interested me because of things which Major Sleemansays about them in his books--particularly what he says about thedivision of labor in them. He says that the whole face of India isparceled out into estates of villages; that nine-tenths of the vastpopulation of the land consist of cultivators of the soil; that it isthese cultivators who inhabit the villages; that there are certain"established" village servants--mechanics and others who are apparentlypaid a wage by the village at large, and whose callings remain in certainfamilies and are handed down from father to son, like an estate. Hegives a list of these established servants: Priest, blacksmith,carpenter, accountant, washerman, basketmaker, potter, watchman, barber,shoemaker, brazier, confectioner, weaver, dyer, etc. In his day witchesabounded, and it was not thought good business wisdom for a man to marryhis daughter into a family that hadn't a witch in it, for she would needa witch on the premises to protect her children from the evil spellswhich would certainly be cast upon them by the witches connected with theneighboring families.
The office of midwife was hereditary in the family of the basket-maker.It belonged to his wife. She might not be competent, but the office washers, anyway. Her pay was not high--25 cents for a boy, and half as muchfor a girl. The girl was not desired, because she would be a disastrousexpense by and by. As soon as she should be old enough to begin to wearclothes for propriety's sake, it would be a disgrace to the family if shewere not married; and to marry her meant financial ruin; for by customthe father must spend upon feasting and wedding-display everything he hadand all he could borrow--in fact, reduce himself to a condition ofpoverty which he might never more recover from.
It was the dread of this prospective ruin which made the killing ofgirl-babies so prevalent in India in the old days before England laid theiron hand of her prohibitions upon the piteous slaughter. One may judgeof how prevalent the custom was, by one of Sleeman's casual electricalremarks, when he speaks of children at play in villages--wheregirl-voices were never heard!
The wedding-display folly is still in full force in India, and byconsequence the destruction of girl-babies is still furtively practiced;but not largely, because of the vigilance of the government and thesternness of the penalties it levies.
In some parts of India the village keeps in its pay three other servants:an astrologer to tell the villager when he may plant his crop, or make ajourney, or marry a wife, or strangle a child, or borrow a dog, or climba tree, or catch a rat, or swindle a neighbor, without offending thealert and solicitous heavens; and what his dream means, if he has had oneand was not bright enough to interpret it himself by the details of hisdinner; the two other established servants were the tiger-persuader andthe hailstorm discourager. The one kept away the tigers if he could, andcollected the wages anyway, and the other kept off the hailstorms, orexplained why he failed. He charged the same for explaining a failurethat he did for scoring a success. A man is an idiot who can't earn aliving in India.
Major Sleeman reveals the fact that the trade union and the boycott areantiquities in India. India seems to have originated everything. The"sweeper" belongs to the bottom caste; he is the lowest of the low--allother castes despise him and scorn his office. But that does not troublehim. His caste is a caste, and that is sufficient for him, and so he isproud of it, not ashamed. Sleeman says:
 "It is perhaps not known to many of my countrymen, even in India, that in every town and city in the country the right of sweeping the houses and streets is a monopoly, and is supported entirely by the pride of castes among the scavengers, who are all of the lowest class. The right of sweeping within a certain range is recognized by the caste to belong to a certain member; and if any other member presumes to sweep within that range, he is excommunicated--no other member will smoke out of his pipe or drink out of his jug; and he can get restored to caste only by a feast to the whole body of sweepers. If any housekeeper within a particular circle happens to offend the sweeper of that range, none of his filth will be removed till he pacifies him, because no other sweeper will dare to touch it; and the people of a town are often more tyrannized over by these people than by any other."
A footnote by Major Sleeman's editor, Mr. Vincent Arthur Smith, says thatin our day this tyranny of the sweepers' guild is one of the manydifficulties which bar the progress of Indian sanitary reform. Think ofthis:
 "The sweepers cannot be readily coerced, because no Hindoo or Mussulman would do their work to save his life, nor will he pollute himself by beating the refractory scavenger."
They certainly do seem to have the whip-hand; it would be difficult toimagine a more impregnable position. "The vested rights described in thetext are so fully recognized in practice that they are frequently thesubject of sale or mortgage."
Just like a milk-route; or like a London crossing-sweepership. It issaid that the London crossing-sweeper's right to his crossing isrecognized by the rest of the guild; that they protect him in itspossession; that certain choice crossings are valuable property, and aresaleable at high figures. I have noticed that the man who sweeps infront of the Army and Navy Stores has a wealthy South Africanaristocratic style about him; and when he is off his guard, he hasexactly that look on his face which you always see in the face of a manwho has is saving up his daughter to marry her to a duke.
It appears from Sleeman that in India the occupation of elephant-driveris confined to Mohammedans. I wonder why that is. The water-carrier('bheestie') is a Mohammedan, but it is said that the reason of that is,that the Hindoo's religion does not allow him to touch the skin of deadkine, and that is what the water-sack is made of; it would defile him.And it doesn't allow him to eat meat; the animal that furnished the meatwas murdered, and to take any creature's life is a sin. It is a good andgentle religion, but inconvenient.
A great Indian river, at low water, suggests the familiar anatomicalpicture of a skinned human body, the intricate mesh of interwoven musclesand tendons to stand for water-channels, and the archipelagoes of fat andflesh inclosed by them to stand for the sandbars. Somewhere on thisjourney we passed such a river, and on a later journey we saw in theSutlej the duplicate of that river. Curious rivers they are; low shoresa dizzy distance apart, with nothing between but an enormous acreage ofsand-flats with sluggish little veins of water dribbling around amongstthem; Saharas of sand, smallpox-pitted with footprints punctured in beltsas straight as the equator clear from the one shore to the other (barringthe channel-interruptions)--a dry-shod ferry, you see. Long railwaybridges are required for this sort of rivers, and India has them. Youapproach Allahabad by a very long one. It was now carrying us across thebed of the Jumna, a bed which did not seem to have been slept in for onewhile or more. It wasn't all river-bed--most of it was overflow ground.
Allahabad means "City of God." I get this from the books. From a printedcuriosity--a letter written by one of those brave and confident Hindoostrugglers with the English tongue, called a "babu"--I got a morecompressed translation: "Godville." It is perfectly correct, but that isthe most that can be said for it.
We arrived in the forenoon, and short-handed; for Satan got left behindsomewhere that morning, and did not overtake us until after nightfall.It seemed very peaceful without him. The world seemed asleep anddreaming.
I did not see the native town, I think. I do not remember why; for anincident connects it with the Great Mutiny, and that is enough to makeany place interesting. But I saw the English part of the city. It is atown of wide avenues and noble distances, and is comely and alluring, andfull of suggestions of comfort and leisure, and of the serenity which agood conscience buttressed by a sufficient bank account gives. Thebungalows (dwellings) stand well back in the seclusion and privacy oflarge enclosed compounds (private grounds, as we should say) and in theshade and shelter of trees. Even the photographer and the prosperousmerchant ply their industries in the elegant reserve of big compounds,and the citizens drive in thereupon their business occasions. And not incabs--no; in the Indian cities cabs are for the drifting stranger; allthe white citizens have private carriages; and each carriage has a flockof white-turbaned black footmen and drivers all over it. The vicinity ofa lecture-hall looks like a snowstorm,--and makes the lecturer feel likean opera. India has many names, and they are correctly descriptive. Itis the Land of Contradictions, the Land of Subtlety and Superstition, theLand of Wealth and Poverty, the Land of Splendor and Desolation, the Landof Plague and Famine, the Land of the Thug and the Poisoner, and of theMeek and the Patient, the Land of the Suttee, the Land of theUnreinstatable Widow, the Land where All Life is Holy, the Land ofCremation, the Land where the Vulture is a Grave and a Monument, the Landof the Multitudinous Gods; and if signs go for anything, it is the Landof the Private Carriage.
In Bombay the forewoman of a millinery shop came to the hotel in herprivate carriage to take the measure for a gown--not for me, but foranother. She had come out to India to make a temporary stay, but wasextending it indefinitely; indeed, she was purposing to end her daysthere. In London, she said, her work had been hard, her hours long; foreconomy's sake she had had to live in shabby rooms and far away from theshop, watch the pennies, deny herself many of the common comforts oflife, restrict herself in effect to its bare necessities, eschew cabs,travel third-class by underground train to and from her work, swallowingcoal-smoke and cinders all the way, and sometimes troubled with thesociety of men and women who were less desirable than the smoke and thecinders. But in Bombay, on almost any kind of wages, she could live incomfort, and keep her carriage, and have six servants in place of thewoman-of-all-work she had had in her English home. Later, in Calcutta, Ifound that the Standard Oil clerks had small one-horse vehicles, and didno walking; and I was told that the clerks of the other large concernsthere had the like equipment. But to return to Allahabad.
I was up at dawn, the next morning. In India the tourist's servant doesnot sleep in a room in the hotel, but rolls himself up head and ears inhis blanket and stretches himself on the veranda, across the front of hismaster's door, and spends the night there. I don't believe anybody'sservant occupies a room. Apparently, the bungalow servants sleep on theveranda; it is roomy, and goes all around the house. I speak ofmenservants; I saw none of the other sex. I think there are none, exceptchild-nurses. I was up at dawn, and walked around the veranda, past therows of sleepers. In front of one door a Hindoo servant was squatting,waiting for his master to call him. He had polished the yellow shoes andplaced them by the door, and now he had nothing to do but wait. It wasfreezing cold, but there he was, as motionless as a sculptured image, andas patient. It troubled me. I wanted to say to him, "Don't crouch therelike that and freeze; nobody requires it of you; stir around and getwarm." But I hadn't the words. I thought of saying 'jeldy jow', but Icouldn't remember what it meant, so I didn't say it. I knew anotherphrase, but it wouldn't come to my mind. I moved on, purposing todismiss him from my thoughts, but his bare legs and bare feet kept himthere. They kept drawing me back from the sunny side to a point whence Icould see him. At the end of an hour he had not changed his attitude inthe least degree. It was a curious and impressive exhibition of meeknessand patience, or fortitude or indifference, I did not know which. But itworried me, and it was spoiling my morning. In fact, it spoiled twohours of it quite thoroughly. I quitted this vicinity, then, and lefthim to punish himself as much as he might want to. But up to that timethe man had not changed his attitude a hair. He will always remain withme, I suppose; his figure never grows vague in my memory. Whenever Iread of Indian resignation, Indian patience under wrongs, hardships, andmisfortunes, he comes before me. He becomes a personification, andstands for India in trouble. And for untold ages India in trouble hasbeen pursued with the very remark which I was going to utter but didn't,because its meaning had slipped me: "Jeddy jow!" ("Come, shove along!")
Why, it was the very thing.
In the early brightness we made a long drive out to the Fort. Part ofthe way was beautiful. It led under stately trees and through groups ofnative houses and by the usual village well, where the picturesque gangsare always flocking to and fro and laughing and chattering; and this timebrawny men were deluging their bronze bodies with the limpid water, andmaking a refreshing and enticing show of it; enticing, for the sun wasalready transacting business, firing India up for the day. There wasplenty of this early bathing going on, for it was getting towardbreakfast time, and with an unpurified body the Hindoo must not eat.
Then we struck into the hot plain, and found the roads crowded withpilgrims of both sexes, for one of the great religious fairs of India wasbeing held, just beyond the Fort, at the junction of the sacred rivers,the Ganges and the Jumna. Three sacred rivers, I should have said, forthere is a subterranean one. Nobody has seen it, but that doesn'tsignify. The fact that it is there is enough. These pilgrims had comefrom all over India; some of them had been months on the way, ploddingpatiently along in the heat and dust, worn, poor, hungry, but supportedand sustained by an unwavering faith and belief; they were supremelyhappy and content, now; their full and sufficient reward was at hand;they were going to be cleansed from every vestige of sin and corruptionby these holy waters which make utterly pure whatsoever thing they touch,even the dead and rotten. It is wonderful, the power of a faith likethat, that can make multitudes upon multitudes of the old and weak andthe young and frail enter without hesitation or complaint upon suchincredible journeys and endure the resultant miseries without repining.It is done in love, or it is done in fear; I do not know which it is.No matter what the impulse is, the act born of it is beyond imaginationmarvelous to our kind of people, the cold whites. There are choice greatnatures among us that could exhibit the equivalent of this prodigiousself-sacrifice, but the rest of us know that we should not be equal toanything approaching it. Still, we all talk self-sacrifice, and thismakes me hope that we are large enough to honor it in the Hindoo.
Two millions of natives arrive at this fair every year. How many start,and die on the road, from age and fatigue and disease and scantynourishment, and how many die on the return, from the same causes, no oneknows; but the tale is great, one may say enormous. Every twelfth yearis held to be a year of peculiar grace; a greatly augmented volume ofpilgrims results then. The twelfth year has held this distinction sincethe remotest times, it is said. It is said also that there is to be butone more twelfth year--for the Ganges. After that, that holiest of allsacred rivers will cease to be holy, and will be abandoned by the pilgrimfor many centuries; how many, the wise men have not stated. At the endof that interval it will become holy again. Meantime, the data will bearranged by those people who have charge of all such matters, the greatchief Brahmins. It will be like shutting down a mint. At a first glanceit looks most unbrahminically uncommercial, but I am not disturbed, beingsoothed and tranquilized by their reputation. "Brer fox he lay low," asUncle Remus says; and at the judicious time he will spring something onthe Indian public which will show that he was not financially asleep whenhe took the Ganges out of the market.
Great numbers of the natives along the roads were bringing away holywater from the rivers. They would carry it far and wide in India andsell it. Tavernier, the French traveler (17th century), notes thatGanges water is often given at weddings, "each guest receiving a cup ortwo, according to the liberality of the host; sometimes 2,000 or 3,000rupees' worth of it is consumed at a wedding."
The Fort is a huge old structure, and has had a large experience inreligions. In its great court stands a monolith which was placed theremore than 2,000 years ago to preach (Budhism) by its pious inscription;the Fort was built three centuries ago by a Mohammedan Emperor--aresanctification of the place in the interest of that religion. There isa Hindoo temple, too, with subterranean ramifications stocked withshrines and idols; and now the Fort belongs to the English, it contains aChristian Church. Insured in all the companies.
From the lofty ramparts one has a fine view of the sacred rivers. Theyjoin at that point--the pale blue Jumna, apparently clean and clear, andthe muddy Ganges, dull yellow and not clean. On a long curved spitbetween the rivers, towns of tents were visible, with a multitude offluttering pennons, and a mighty swarm of pilgrims. It was a troublesomeplace to get down to, and not a quiet place when you arrived; but it wasinteresting. There was a world of activity and turmoil and noise, partlyreligious, partly commercial; for the Mohammedans were there to curse andsell, and the Hindoos to buy and pray. It is a fair as well as areligious festival. Crowds were bathing, praying, and drinking thepurifying waters, and many sick pilgrims had come long journeys inpalanquins to be healed of their maladies by a bath; or if that might notbe, then to die on the blessed banks and so make sure of heaven. Therewere fakeers in plenty, with their bodies dusted over with ashes andtheir long hair caked together with cow-dung; for the cow is holy and sois the rest of it; so holy that the good Hindoo peasant frescoes thewalls of his hut with this refuse, and also constructs ornamental figuresout of it for the gracing of his dirt floor. There were seated families,fearfully and wonderfully painted, who by attitude and groupingrepresented the families of certain great gods. There was a holy man whosat naked by the day and by the week on a cluster of iron spikes, and didnot seem to mind it; and another holy man, who stood all day holding hiswithered arms motionless aloft, and was said to have been doing it foryears. All of these performers have a cloth on the ground beside themfor the reception of contributions, and even the poorest of the peoplegive a trifle and hope that the sacrifice will be blessed to him. Atlast came a procession of naked holy people marching by and chanting, andI wrenched myself away.
