This has been a stirring day. The Superintendent of the railway put atrain at our disposal, and did us the further kindness of accompanying usto Ephesus and giving to us his watchful care. We brought sixty scarcelyperceptible donkeys in the freight cars, for we had much ground to goover. We have seen some of the most grotesque costumes, along the lineof the railroad, that can be imagined. I am glad that no possiblecombination of words could describe them, for I might then be foolishenough to attempt it.
At ancient Ayassalook, in the midst of a forbidding desert, we came uponlong lines of ruined aqueducts, and other remnants of architecturalgrandeur, that told us plainly enough we were nearing what had been ametropolis, once. We left the train and mounted the donkeys, along withour invited guests--pleasant young gentlemen from the officers' list ofan American man-of-war.
The little donkeys had saddles upon them which were made very high inorder that the rider's feet might not drag the ground. The preventativedid not work well in the cases of our tallest pilgrims, however. Therewere no bridles--nothing but a single rope, tied to the bit. It waspurely ornamental, for the donkey cared nothing for it. If he weredrifting to starboard, you might put your helm down hard the other way,if it were any satisfaction to you to do it, but he would continue todrift to starboard all the same. There was only one process which couldbe depended on, and it was to get down and lift his rear around until hishead pointed in the right direction, or take him under your arm and carryhim to a part of the road which he could not get out of without climbing.The sun flamed down as hot as a furnace, and neck-scarfs, veils andumbrellas seemed hardly any protection; they served only to make the longprocession look more than ever fantastic--for be it known the ladies wereall riding astride because they could not stay on the shapeless saddlessidewise, the men were perspiring and out of temper, their feet werebanging against the rocks, the donkeys were capering in every directionbut the right one and being belabored with clubs for it, and every nowand then a broad umbrella would suddenly go down out of the cavalcade,announcing to all that one more pilgrim had bitten the dust. It was awilder picture than those solitudes had seen for many a day. No donkeysever existed that were as hard to navigate as these, I think, or that hadso many vile, exasperating instincts. Occasionally we grew so tired andbreathless with fighting them that we had to desist,--and immediately thedonkey would come down to a deliberate walk. This, with the fatigue, andthe sun, would put a man asleep; and soon as the man was asleep, thedonkey would lie down. My donkey shall never see his boyhood's homeagain. He has lain down once too often. He must die.
We all stood in the vast theatre of ancient Ephesus,--the stone-benchedamphitheatre I mean--and had our picture taken. We looked as properthere as we would look any where, I suppose. We do not embellish thegeneral desolation of a desert much. We add what dignity we can to astately ruin with our green umbrellas and jackasses, but it is little.However, we mean well.
I wish to say a brief word of the aspect of Ephesus.
On a high, steep hill, toward the sea, is a gray ruin of ponderous blocksof marble, wherein, tradition says, St. Paul was imprisoned eighteencenturies ago. From these old walls you have the finest view of thedesolate scene where once stood Ephesus, the proudest city of ancienttimes, and whose Temple of Diana was so noble in design, and so exquisiteof workmanship, that it ranked high in the list of the Seven Wonders ofthe World.
Behind you is the sea; in front is a level green valley, (a marsh, infact,) extending far away among the mountains; to the right of the frontview is the old citadel of Ayassalook, on a high hill; the ruined Mosqueof the Sultan Selim stands near it in the plain, (this is built over thegrave of St. John, and was formerly Christian Church); further towardyou is the hill of Pion, around whose front is clustered all that remainsof the ruins of Ephesus that still stand; divided from it by a narrowvalley is the long, rocky, rugged mountain of Coressus. The scene is apretty one, and yet desolate--for in that wide plain no man can live, andin it is no human habitation. But for the crumbling arches and monstrouspiers and broken walls that rise from the foot of the hill of Pion, onecould not believe that in this place once stood a city whose renown isolder than tradition itself. It is incredible to reflect that things asfamiliar all over the world to-day as household words, belong in thehistory and in the shadowy legends of this silent, mournful solitude.We speak of Apollo and of Diana--they were born here; of themetamorphosis of Syrinx into a reed--it was done here; of the great godPan--he dwelt in the caves of this hill of Coressus; of the Amazons--thiswas their best prized home; of Bacchus and Hercules both fought thewarlike women here; of the Cyclops--they laid the ponderous marble blocksof some of the ruins yonder; of Homer--this was one of his manybirthplaces; of Cirmon of Athens; of Alcibiades, Lysander, Agesilaus--they visited here; so did Alexander the Great; so did Hannibal andAntiochus, Scipio, Lucullus and Sylla; Brutus, Cassius, Pompey, Cicero,and Augustus; Antony was a judge in this place, and left his seat in theopen court, while the advocates were speaking, to run after Cleopatra,who passed the door; from this city these two sailed on pleasureexcursions, in galleys with silver oars and perfumed sails, and withcompanies of beautiful girls to serve them, and actors and musicians toamuse them; in days that seem almost modern, so remote are they from theearly history of this city, Paul the Apostle preached the new religionhere, and so did John, and here it is supposed the former was pittedagainst wild beasts, for in 1 Corinthians, xv. 32 he says:
 "If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus," &c.,
when many men still lived who had seen the Christ; here Mary Magdalendied, and here the Virgin Mary ended her days with John, albeit Rome hassince judged it best to locate her grave elsewhere; six or seven hundredyears ago--almost yesterday, as it were--troops of mail-clad Crusadersthronged the streets; and to come down to trifles, we speak of meanderingstreams, and find a new interest in a common word when we discover thatthe crooked river Meander, in yonder valley, gave it to our dictionary.It makes me feel as old as these dreary hills to look down upon thesemoss-hung ruins, this historic desolation. One may read the Scripturesand believe, but he can not go and stand yonder in the ruined theatre andin imagination people it again with the vanished multitudes who mobbedPaul's comrades there and shouted, with one voice, "Great is Diana of theEphesians!" The idea of a shout in such a solitude as this almost makesone shudder.
It was a wonderful city, this Ephesus. Go where you will about thesebroad plains, you find the most exquisitely sculptured marble fragmentsscattered thick among the dust and weeds; and protruding from the ground,or lying prone upon it, are beautiful fluted columns of porphyry and allprecious marbles; and at every step you find elegantly carved capitalsand massive bases, and polished tablets engraved with Greek inscriptions.It is a world of precious relics, a wilderness of marred and mutilatedgems. And yet what are these things to the wonders that lie buried hereunder the ground? At Constantinople, at Pisa, in the cities of Spain,are great mosques and cathedrals, whose grandest columns came from thetemples and palaces of Ephesus, and yet one has only to scratch theground here to match them. We shall never know what magnificence is,until this imperial city is laid bare to the sun.
The finest piece of sculpture we have yet seen and the one that impressedus most, (for we do not know much about art and can not easily work upourselves into ecstasies over it,) is one that lies in this old theatreof Ephesus which St. Paul's riot has made so celebrated. It is only theheadless body of a man, clad in a coat of mail, with a Medusa head uponthe breast-plate, but we feel persuaded that such dignity and suchmajesty were never thrown into a form of stone before.
What builders they were, these men of antiquity! The massive arches ofsome of these ruins rest upon piers that are fifteen feet square andbuilt entirely of solid blocks of marble, some of which are as large as aSaratoga trunk, and some the size of a boarding-house sofa. They are notshells or shafts of stone filled inside with rubbish, but the whole pieris a mass of solid masonry. Vast arches, that may have been the gates ofthe city, are built in the same way. They have braved the storms andsieges of three thousand years, and have been shaken by many anearthquake, but still they stand. When they dig alongside of them, theyfind ranges of ponderous masonry that are as perfect in every detail asthey were the day those old Cyclopian giants finished them. An EnglishCompany is going to excavate Ephesus--and then!
And now am I reminded of--
 THE LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SLEEPERS.
In the Mount of Pion, yonder, is the Cave of the Seven Sleepers. Onceupon a time, about fifteen hundred years ago, seven young men lived neareach other in Ephesus, who belonged to the despised sect of theChristians. It came to pass that the good King Maximilianus, (I amtelling this story for nice little boys and girls,) it came to pass, Isay, that the good King Maximilianus fell to persecuting the Christians,and as time rolled on he made it very warm for them. So the seven youngmen said one to the other, let us get up and travel. And they got up andtraveled. They tarried not to bid their fathers and mothers good-bye, orany friend they knew. They only took certain moneys which their parentshad, and garments that belonged unto their friends, whereby they mightremember them when far away; and they took also the dog Ketmehr, whichwas the property of their neighbor Malchus, because the beast did run hishead into a noose which one of the young men was carrying carelessly, andthey had not time to release him; and they took also certain chickensthat seemed lonely in the neighboring coops, and likewise some bottles ofcurious liquors that stood near the grocer's window; and then theydeparted from the city. By-and-by they came to a marvelous cave in theHill of Pion and entered into it and feasted, and presently they hurriedon again. But they forgot the bottles of curious liquors, and left thembehind. They traveled in many lands, and had many strange adventures.They were virtuous young men, and lost no opportunity that fell in theirway to make their livelihood. Their motto was in these words, namely,"Procrastination is the thief of time." And so, whenever they did comeupon a man who was alone, they said, Behold, this person hath thewherewithal--let us go through him. And they went through him. At theend of five years they had waxed tired of travel and adventure, andlonged to revisit their old home again and hear the voices and see thefaces that were dear unto their youth. Therefore they went through suchparties as fell in their way where they sojourned at that time, andjourneyed back toward Ephesus again. For the good King Maximilianus wasbecome converted unto the new faith, and the Christians rejoiced becausethey were no longer persecuted. One day as the sun went down, they cameto the cave in the Mount of Pion, and they said, each to his fellow, Letus sleep here, and go and feast and make merry with our friends when themorning cometh. And each of the seven lifted up his voice and said, Itis a whiz. So they went in, and lo, where they had put them, there laythe bottles of strange liquors, and they judged that age had not impairedtheir excellence. Wherein the wanderers were right, and the heads of thesame were level. So each of the young men drank six bottles, and beholdthey felt very tired, then, and lay down and slept soundly.
When they awoke, one of them, Johannes--surnamed Smithianus--said, We arenaked. And it was so. Their raiment was all gone, and the money whichthey had gotten from a stranger whom they had proceeded through as theyapproached the city, was lying upon the ground, corroded and rusted anddefaced. Likewise the dog Ketmehr was gone, and nothing save the brassthat was upon his collar remained. They wondered much at these things.But they took the money, and they wrapped about their bodies some leaves,and came up to the top of the hill. Then were they perplexed. Thewonderful temple of Diana was gone; many grand edifices they had neverseen before stood in the city; men in strange garbs moved about thestreets, and every thing was changed.
Johannes said, It hardly seems like Ephesus. Yet here is the greatgymnasium; here is the mighty theatre, wherein I have seen seventythousand men assembled; here is the Agora; there is the font where thesainted John the Baptist immersed the converts; yonder is the prison ofthe good St. Paul, where we all did use to go to touch the ancient chainsthat bound him and be cured of our distempers; I see the tomb of thedisciple Luke, and afar off is the church wherein repose the ashes of theholy John, where the Christians of Ephesus go twice a year to gather thedust from the tomb, which is able to make bodies whole again that arecorrupted by disease, and cleanse the soul from sin; but see how thewharves encroach upon the sea, and what multitudes of ships are anchoredin the bay; see, also, how the city hath stretched abroad, far over thevalley behind Pion, and even unto the walls of Ayassalook; and lo, allthe hills are white with palaces and ribbed with colonnades of marble.How mighty is Ephesus become!
And wondering at what their eyes had seen, they went down into the cityand purchased garments and clothed themselves. And when they would havepassed on, the merchant bit the coins which they had given him, with histeeth, and turned them about and looked curiously upon them, and castthem upon his counter, and listened if they rang; and then he said, Thesebe bogus. And they said, Depart thou to Hades, and went their way. Whenthey were come to their houses, they recognized them, albeit they seemedold and mean; and they rejoiced, and were glad. They ran to the doors,and knocked, and strangers opened, and looked inquiringly upon them. Andthey said, with great excitement, while their hearts beat high, and thecolor in their faces came and went, Where is my father? Where is mymother? Where are Dionysius and Serapion, and Pericles, and Decius? Andthe strangers that opened said, We know not these. The Seven said, How,you know them not? How long have ye dwelt here, and whither are theygone that dwelt here before ye? And the strangers said, Ye play upon uswith a jest, young men; we and our fathers have sojourned under theseroofs these six generations; the names ye utter rot upon the tombs, andthey that bore them have run their brief race, have laughed and sung,have borne the sorrows and the weariness that were allotted them, and areat rest; for nine-score years the summers have come and gone, and theautumn leaves have fallen, since the roses faded out of their cheeks andthey laid them to sleep with the dead.
Then the seven young men turned them away from their homes, and thestrangers shut the doors upon them. The wanderers marveled greatly, andlooked into the faces of all they met, as hoping to find one that theyknew; but all were strange, and passed them by and spake no friendlyword. They were sore distressed and sad. Presently they spake unto acitizen and said, Who is King in Ephesus? And the citizen answered andsaid, Whence come ye that ye know not that great Laertius reigns inEphesus? They looked one at the other, greatly perplexed, and presentlyasked again, Where, then, is the good King Maximilianus? The citizenmoved him apart, as one who is afraid, and said, Verily these men be mad,and dream dreams, else would they know that the King whereof they speakis dead above two hundred years agone.
Then the scales fell from the eyes of the Seven, and one said, Alas, thatwe drank of the curious liquors. They have made us weary, and indreamless sleep these two long centuries have we lain. Our homes aredesolate, our friends are dead. Behold, the jig is up--let us die. Andthat same day went they forth and laid them down and died. And in thatself-same day, likewise, the Seven-up did cease in Ephesus, for that theSeven that were up were down again, and departed and dead withal. Andthe names that be upon their tombs, even unto this time, are JohannesSmithianus, Trumps, Gift, High, and Low, Jack, and The Game. And withthe sleepers lie also the bottles wherein were once the curious liquors:and upon them is writ, in ancient letters, such words as these--Dames ofheathen gods of olden time, perchance: Rumpunch, Jinsling, Egnog.
Such is the story of the Seven Sleepers, (with slight variations,) and Iknow it is true, because I have seen the cave myself.
Really, so firm a faith had the ancients this legend, that as late aseight or nine hundred years ago, learned travelers held it insuperstitious fear. Two of them record that they ventured into it, butran quickly out again, not daring to tarry lest they should fall asleepand outlive their great grand-children a century or so. Even at this daythe ignorant denizens of the neighboring country prefer not to sleep init.
