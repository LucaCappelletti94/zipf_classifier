My dear Brother-in-Law, - Please let me write again in Spanish, Icannot trust my English, and I am aware, from what your brotherused to say, that army officers educated at the Military Academy ofthe United States are taught our tongue.  It is as I told you in myother letter:  both my poor sister and her husband, when they foundthey could not recover, expressed the wish that you should havetheir little Catherine - as knowing that you would presently beretired from the army - rather than that she should remain with me,who am broken in health, or go to your mother in California, whosehealth is also frail.
You do not know the child, therefore I must tell you somethingabout her.  You will not be ashamed of her looks, for she is a copyin little of her beautiful mother - and it is that Andalusianbeauty which is not surpassable, even in your country.  She has hermother's charm and grace and good heart and sense of justice, andshe has her father's vivacity and cheerfulness and pluck and spiritof enterprise, with the affectionate disposition and sincerity ofboth parents.
My sister pined for her Spanish home all these years of exile; shewas always talking of Spain to the child, and tending andnourishing the love of Spain in the little thing's heart as aprecious flower; and she died happy in the knowledge that thefruitage of her patriotic labors was as rich as even she coulddesire.
Cathy is a sufficiently good little scholar, for her nine years;her mother taught her Spanish herself, and kept it always freshupon her ear and her tongue by hardly ever speaking with her in anyother tongue; her father was her English teacher, and talked withher in that language almost exclusively; French has been hereveryday speech for more than seven years among her playmates here;she has a good working use of governess - German and Italian.  Itis true that there is always a faint foreign fragrance about herspeech, no matter what language she is talking, but it is only justnoticeable, nothing more, and is rather a charm than a mar, Ithink.  In the ordinary child-studies Cathy is neither before norbehind the average child of nine, I should say.  But I can say thisfor her:  in love for her friends and in high-mindedness and good-heartedness she has not many equals, and in my opinion nosuperiors.  And I beg of you, let her have her way with the dumbanimals - they are her worship.  It is an inheritance from hermother.  She knows but little of cruelties and oppressions - keepthem from her sight if you can.  She would flare up at them andmake trouble, in her small but quite decided and resolute way; forshe has a character of her own, and lacks neither promptness norinitiative.  Sometimes her judgment is at fault, but I think herintentions are always right.  Once when she was a little creatureof three or four years she suddenly brought her tiny foot down uponthe floor in an apparent outbreak of indignation, then fetched it abackward wipe, and stooped down to examine the result.  Her mothersaid:
"Why, what is it, child?  What has stirred you so?"
"Mamma, the big ant was trying to kill the little one."
"And so you protected the little one."
"Yes, manure, because he had no friend, and I wouldn't let the bigone kill him."
"But you have killed them both."
Cathy was distressed, and her lip trembled.  She picked up theremains and laid them upon her palm, and said:
"Poor little anty, I'm so sorry; and I didn't mean to kill you, butthere wasn't any other way to save you, it was such a hurry."
She is a dear and sweet little lady, and when she goes it will giveme a sore heart.  But she will be happy with you, and if your heartis old and tired, give it into her keeping; she will make it youngagain, she will refresh it, she will make it sing.  Be good to her,for all our sakes!
My exile will soon be over now.  As soon as I am a little strongerI shall see my Spain again; and that will make me young again!
MERCEDES.
