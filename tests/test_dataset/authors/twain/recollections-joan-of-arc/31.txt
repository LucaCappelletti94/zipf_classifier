Joan Inspires the Tawdry King
IN THE earliest dawn of morning, Talbot and his English forces evacuatedtheir bastilles and marched away, not stopping to burn, destroy, or carryoff anything, but leaving their fortresses just as they were,provisioned, armed, and equipped for a long siege. It was difficult forthe people to believe that this great thing had really happened; thatthey were actually free once more, and might go and come through any gatethey pleased, with none to molest or forbid; that the terrible Talbot,that scourge of the French, that man whose mere name had been able toannul the effectiveness of French armies, was gone, vanished,retreating--driven away by a girl.
The city emptied itself. Out of every gate the crowds poured. Theyswarmed about the English bastilles like an invasion of ants, but noisierthan those creatures, and carried off the artillery and stores, thenturned all those dozen fortresses into monster bonfires, imitationvolcanoes whose lofty columns of thick smoke seemed supporting the archof the sky.
The delight of the children took another form. To some of the youngerones seven months was a sort of lifetime. They had forgotten what grasswas like, and the velvety green meadows seemed paradise to theirsurprised and happy eyes after the long habit of seeing nothing but dirtylanes and streets. It was a wonder to them--those spacious reaches ofopen country to run and dance and tumble and frolic in, after their dulland joyless captivity; so they scampered far and wide over the fairregions on both sides of the river, and came back at eventide weary, butladen with flowers and flushed with new health drawn from the freshcountry air and the vigorous exercise.
After the burnings, the grown folk followed Joan from church to churchand put in the day in thanksgivings for the city's deliverance, and atnight they feted her and her generals and illuminated the town, and highand low gave themselves up to festivities and rejoicings. By the time thepopulace were fairly in bed, toward dawn, we were in the saddle and awaytoward Tours to report to the King.
That was a march which would have turned any one's head but Joan's. Wemoved between emotional ranks of grateful country-people all the way.They crowded about Joan to touch her feet, her horse, her armor, and theyeven knelt in the road and kissed her horse's hoof-prints.
The land was full of her praises. The most illustrious chiefs of thechurch wrote to the King extolling the Maid, comparing her to the saintsand heroes of the Bible, and warning him not to let "unbelief,ingratitude, or other injustice" hinder or impair the divine help sentthrough her. One might think there was a touch of prophecy in that, andwe will let it go at that; but to my mind it had its inspiration in thosegreat men's accurate knowledge of the King's trivial and treacherouscharacter.
The King had come to Tours to meet Joan. At the present day this poorthing is called Charles the Victorious, on account of victories whichother people won for him, but in our time we had a private name for himwhich described him better, and was sanctified to him by personaldeserving--Charles the Base. When we entered the presence he sat throned,with his tinseled snobs and dandies around him. He looked like a forkedcarrot, so tightly did his clothing fit him from his waist down; he woreshoes with a rope-like pliant toe a foot long that had to be hitched upto the knee to keep it out of the way; he had on a crimson velvet capethat came no lower than his elbows; on his head he had a tall felt thinglike a thimble, with a feather it its jeweled band that stuck up like apen from an inkhorn, and from under that thimble his bush of stiff hairstuck down to his shoulders, curving outward at the bottom, so that thecap and the hair together made the head like a shuttlecock. All thematerials of his dress were rich, and all the colors brilliant. In hislap he cuddled a miniature greyhound that snarled, lifting its lip andshowing its white teeth whenever any slight movement disturbed it. TheKing's dandies were dressed in about the same fashion as himself, andwhen I remembered that Joan had called the war-council of Orleans"disguised ladies' maids," it reminded me of people who squander alltheir money on a trifle and then haven't anything to invest when theycome across a better chance; that name ought to have been saved for thesecreatures.
Joan fell on her knees before the majesty of France, and the otherfrivolous animal in his lap--a sight which it pained me to see. What hadthat man done for his country or for anybody in it, that she or any otherperson should kneel to him? But she--she had just done the only greatdeed that had been done for France in fifty years, and had consecrated itwith the libation of her blood. The positions should have been reversed.
However, to be fair, one must grant that Charles acquitted himself verywell for the most part, on that occasion--very much better than he was inthe habit of doing. He passed his pup to a courtier, and took off his capto Joan as if she had been a queen. Then he stepped from his throne andraised her, and showed quite a spirited and manly joy and gratitude inwelcoming her and thanking her for her extraordinary achievement in hisservice. My prejudices are of a later date than that. If he had continuedas he was at that moment, I should not have acquired them.
He acted handsomely. He said:
"You shall not kneel to me, my matchless General; you have wroughtroyally, and royal courtesies are your due." Noticing that she was pale,he said, "But you must not stand; you have lost blood for France, andyour wound is yet green--come." He led her to a seat and sat down by her."Now, then, speak out frankly, as to one who owes you much and freelyconfesses it before all this courtly assemblage. What shall be yourreward? Name it."
I was ashamed of him. And yet that was not fair, for how could he beexpected to know this marvelous child in these few weeks, when we whothought we had known her all her life were daily seeing the cloudsuncover some new altitudes of her character whose existence was notsuspected by us before? But we are all that way: when we know a thing wehave only scorn for other people who don't happen to know it. And I wasashamed of these courtiers, too, for the way they licked their chops, soto speak, as envying Joan her great chance, they not knowing her anybetter than the King did. A blush began to rise in Joan's cheeks at thethought that she was working for her country for pay, and she dropped herhead and tried to hide her face, as girls always do when they findthemselves blushing; no one knows why they do, but they do, and the morethey blush the more they fail to get reconciled to it, and the more theycan't bear to have people look at them when they are doing it. The Kingmade it a great deal worse by calling attention to it, which is theunkindest thing a person can do when a girl is blushing; sometimes, whenthere is a big crowd of strangers, it is even likely to make her cry ifshe is as young as Joan was. God knows the reason for this, it is hiddenfrom men. As for me, I would as soon blush as sneeze; in fact, I wouldrather. However, these meditations are not of consequence: I will go onwith what I was saying. The King rallied her for blushing, and thisbrought up the rest of the blood and turned her face to fire. Then he wassorry, seeing what he had done, and tried to make her comfortable bysaying the blush was exceeding becoming to her and not to mind it--whichcaused even the dog to notice it now, so of course the red in Joan's faceturned to purple, and the tears overflowed and ran down--I could havetold anybody that that would happen. The King was distressed, and sawthat the best thing to do would be to get away from this subject, so hebegan to say the finest kind of things about Joan's capture of theTourelles, and presently when she was more composed he mentioned thereward again and pressed her to name it. Everybody listened with anxiousinterest to hear what her claim was going to be, but when her answer cametheir faces showed that the thing she asked for was not what they hadbeen expecting.
"Oh, dear and gracious Dauphin, I have but one desire--only one. If--"
"Do not be afraid, my child--name it."
"That you will not delay a day. My army is strong and valiant, and eagerto finish its work--march with me to Rheims and receive your crown." Youcould see the indolent King shrink, in his butterfly clothes.
"To Rheims--oh, impossible, my General! We march through the heart ofEngland's power?"
Could those be French faces there? Not one of them lighted in response tothe girl's brave proposition, but all promptly showed satisfaction in theKing's objection. Leave this silken idleness for the rude contact of war?None of these butterflies desired that. They passed their jeweledcomfit-boxes one to another and whispered their content in the headbutterfly's practical prudence. Joan pleaded with the King, saying:
"Ah, I pray you do not throw away this perfect opportunity. Everything isfavorable--everything. It is as if the circumstances were specially madefor it. The spirits of our army are exalted with victory, those of theEnglish forces depressed by defeat. Delay will change this. Seeing ushesitate to follow up our advantage, our men will wonder, doubt, loseconfidence, and the English will wonder, gather courage, and be boldagain. Now is the time--pritheee let us march!"
The King shook his head, and La Tremouille, being asked for an opinion,eagerly furnished it:
"Sire, all prudence is against it. Think of the English strongholds alongthe Loire; think of those that lie between us and Rheims!"
He was going on, but Joan cut him short, and said, turning to him:
"If we wait, they will all be strengthened, reinforced. Will thatadvantage us?"
"Why--no."
"Then what is your suggestion?--what is it that you would propose to do?"
"My judgment is to wait."
"Wait for what?"
The minister was obliged to hesitate, for he knew of no explanation thatwould sound well. Moreover, he was not used to being catechized in thisfashion, with the eyes of a crowd of people on him, so he was irritated,and said:
"Matters of state are not proper matters for public discussion."
Joan said placidly:
"I have to beg your pardon. My trespass came of ignorance. I did not knowthat matters connected with your department of the government werematters of state."
The minister lifted his brows in amused surprise, and said, with a touchof sarcasm:
"I am the King's chief minister, and yet you had the impression thatmatters connected with my department are not matters of state? Pray, howis that?"
Joan replied, indifferently:
"Because there is no state."
"No state!"
"No, sir, there is no state, and no use for a minister. France is shrunkto a couple of acres of ground; a sheriff's constable could take care ofit; its affairs are not matters of state. The term is too large."
The King did not blush, but burst into a hearty, careless laugh, and thecourt laughed too, but prudently turned its head and did it silently. LaTremouille was angry, and opened his mouth to speak, but the King put uphis hand, and said:
"There--I take her under the royal protection. She has spoken the truth,the ungilded truth--how seldom I hear it! With all this tinsel on me andall this tinsel about me, I am but a sheriff after all--a poor shabbytwo-acre sheriff--and you are but a constable," and he laughed hiscordial laugh again. "Joan, my frank, honest General, will you name yourreward? I would ennoble you. You shall quarter the crown and the liliesof France for blazon, and with them your victorious sword to defendthem--speak the word."
It made an eager buzz of surprise and envy in the assemblage, but Joanshook her head and said:
"Ah, I cannot, dear and noble Dauphin. To be allowed to work for France,to spend one's self for France, is itself so supreme a reward thatnothing can add to it--nothing. Give me the one reward I ask, the dearestof all rewards, the highest in your gift--march with me to Rheims andreceive your crown. I will beg it on my knees."
But the King put his hand on her arm, and there was a really braveawakening in his voice and a manly fire in his eye when he said:
"No, sit. You have conquered me--it shall be as you--"
But a warning sign from his minister halted him, and he added, to therelief of the court:
"Well, well, we will think of it, we will think it over and see. Doesthat content you, impulsive little soldier?"
The first part of the speech sent a glow of delight to Joan's face, butthe end of it quenched it and she looked sad, and the tears gathered inher eyes. After a moment she spoke out with what seemed a sort ofterrified impulse, and said:
"Oh, use me; I beseech you, use me--there is but little time!"
"But little time?"
"Only a year--I shall last only a year."
"Why, child, there are fifty good years in that compact little body yet."
"Oh, you err, indeed you do. In one little year the end will come. Ah,the time is so short, so short; the moments are flying, and so much to bedone. Oh, use me, and quickly--it is life or death for France."
Even those insects were sobered by her impassioned words. The King lookedvery grave--grave, and strongly impressed. His eyes lit suddenly with aneloquent fire, and he rose and drew his sword and raised it aloft; thenhe brought it slowly down upon Joan's shoulder and said:
"Ah, thou art so simple, so true, so great, so noble--and by thisaccolade I join thee to the nobility of France, thy fitting place! Andfor thy sake I do hereby ennoble all thy family and all thy kin; and alltheir descendants born in wedlock, not only in the male but also in thefemale line. And more!--more! To distinguish thy house and honor it aboveall others, we add a privilege never accorded to any before in thehistory of these dominions: the females of thy line shall have and holdthe right to ennoble their husbands when these shall be of inferiordegree." [Astonishment and envy flared up in every countenance when thewords were uttered which conferred this extraordinary grace. The Kingpaused and looked around upon these signs with quite evidentsatisfaction.] "Rise, Joan of Arc, now and henceforth surnamed Du Lis, ingrateful acknowledgment of the good blow which you have struck for thelilies of France; and they, and the royal crown, and your own victorioussword, fit and fair company for each other, shall be grouped in youescutcheon and be and remain the symbol of your high nobility forever."
As my Lady Du Lis rose, the gilded children of privilege pressed forwardto welcome her to their sacred ranks and call her by her new name; butshe was troubled, and said these honors were not meet for one of herlowly birth and station, and by their kind grace she would remain simpleJoan of Arc, nothing more--and so be called.
Nothing more! As if there could be anything more, anything higher,anything greater. My Lady Du Lis--why, it was tinsel, petty, perishable.But, JOAN OF ARC! The mere sound of it sets one's pulses leaping.
