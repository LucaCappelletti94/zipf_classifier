"When did you come?"
"Arrived at sundown."
"Where from?"
"Salt Lake."
"Are you in the service?"
"No.  Trade."
"Pirate trade, I reckon."
"What do you know about it?"
"I saw you when you came.  I recognized your master.  He is a badsort.  Trap-robber, horse-thief, squaw-man, renegado - Hank Butters- I know him very well.  Stole you, didn't he?"
"Well, it amounted to that."
"I thought so.  Where is his pard?"
"He stopped at White Cloud's camp."
"He is another of the same stripe, is Blake Haskins."  (ASIDE.)They are laying for Buffalo Bill again, I guess.  (ALOUD.)  "Whatis your name?"
"Which one?"
"Have you got more than one?"
"I get a new one every time I'm stolen.  I used to have an honestname, but that was early; I've forgotten it.  Since then I've hadthirteen ALIASES."
"Aliases?  What is alias?"
"A false name."
"Alias.  It's a fine large word, and is in my line; it has quite alearned and cerebrospinal incandescent sound.  Are you educated?"
"Well, no, I can't claim it.  I can take down bars, I candistinguish oats from shoe-pegs, I can blaspheme a saddle-boil withthe college-bred, and I know a few other things - not many; I havehad no chance, I have always had to work; besides, I am of lowbirth and no family.  You speak my dialect like a native, but youare not a Mexican Plug, you are a gentleman, I can see that; andeducated, of course."
"Yes, I am of old family, and not illiterate.  I am a fossil."
"A which?"
"Fossil.  The first horses were fossils.  They date back twomillion years."
"Gr-eat sand and sage-brush! do you mean it?"
"Yes, it is true.  The bones of my ancestors are held in reverenceand worship, even by men.  They do not leave them exposed to theweather when they find them, but carry them three thousand milesand enshrine them in their temples of learning, and worship them."
"It is wonderful!  I knew you must be a person of distinction, byyour fine presence and courtly address, and by the fact that youare not subjected to the indignity of hobbles, like myself and therest.  Would you tell me your name?"
"You have probably heard of it - Soldier Boy."
"What! - the renowned, the illustrious?"
"Even so."
"It takes my breath!  Little did I dream that ever I should standface to face with the possessor of that great name.  Buffalo Bill'shorse!  Known from the Canadian border to the deserts of Arizona,and from the eastern marches of the Great Plains to the foot-hillsof the Sierra!  Truly this is a memorable day.  You still serve thecelebrated Chief of Scouts?"
"I am still his property, but he has lent me, for a time, to themost noble, the most gracious, the most excellent, her ExcellencyCatherine, Corporal-General Seventh Cavalry and Flag-LieutenantNinth Dragoons, U.S.A., - on whom be peace!"
"Amen.  Did you say HER Excellency?"
"The same.  A Spanish lady, sweet blossom of a ducal house.  Andtruly a wonder; knowing everything, capable of everything; speakingall the languages, master of all sciences, a mind without horizons,a heart of gold, the glory of her race!  On whom be peace!"
"Amen.  It is marvellous!"
"Verily.  I knew many things, she has taught me others.  I ameducated.  I will tell you about her."
"I listen - I am enchanted."
"I will tell a plain tale, calmly, without excitement, withouteloquence.  When she had been here four or five weeks she wasalready erudite in military things, and they made her an officer -a double officer.  She rode the drill every day, like any soldier;and she could take the bugle and direct the evolutions herself.Then, on a day, there was a grand race, for prizes - none to enterbut the children.  Seventeen children entered, and she was theyoungest.  Three girls, fourteen boys - good riders all.  It was asteeplechase, with four hurdles, all pretty high.  The first prizewas a most cunning half-grown silver bugle, and mighty pretty, withred silk cord and tassels.  Buffalo Bill was very anxious; for hehad taught her to ride, and he did most dearly want her to win thatrace, for the glory of it.  So he wanted her to ride me, but shewouldn't; and she reproached him, and said it was unfair andunright, and taking advantage; for what horse in this post or anyother could stand a chance against me? and she was very severe withhim, and said, 'You ought to be ashamed - you are proposing to meconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.'  So he just tossedher up in the air about thirty feet and caught her as she camedown, and said he was ashamed; and put up his handkerchief andpretended to cry, which nearly broke her heart, and she petted him,and begged him to forgive her, and said she would do anything inthe world he could ask but that; but he said he ought to go hanghimself, and he MUST, if he could get a rope; it was nothing butright he should, for he never, never could forgive himself; andthen SHE began to cry, and they both sobbed, the way you could hearhim a mile, and she clinging around his neck and pleading, till atlast he was comforted a little, and gave his solemn promise hewouldn't hang himself till after the race; and wouldn't do it atall if she won it, which made her happy, and she said she would winit or die in the saddle; so then everything was pleasant again andboth of them content.  He can't help playing jokes on her, he is sofond of her and she is so innocent and unsuspecting; and when shefinds it out she cuffs him and is in a fury, but presently forgiveshim because it's him; and maybe the very next day she's caught withanother joke; you see she can't learn any better, because shehasn't any deceit in her, and that kind aren't ever expecting it inanother person.
"It was a grand race.  The whole post was there, and there was suchanother whooping and shouting when the seventeen kids came flyingdown the turf and sailing over the hurdles - oh, beautiful to see!Half-way down, it was kind of neck and neck, and anybody's race andnobody's.  Then, what should happen but a cow steps out and putsher head down to munch grass, with her broadside to the battalion,and they a-coming like the wind; they split apart to flank her, butSHE? - why, she drove the spurs home and soared over that cow likea bird! and on she went, and cleared the last hurdle solitary andalone, the army letting loose the grand yell, and she skipped fromthe horse the same as if he had been standing still, and made herbow, and everybody crowded around to congratulate, and they gaveher the bugle, and she put it to her lips and blew 'boots andsaddles' to see how it would go, and BB was as proud as you can'tthink!  And he said, 'Take Soldier Boy, and don't pass him backtill I ask for him!' and I can tell you he wouldn't have said thatto any other person on this planet.  That was two months and moreago, and nobody has been on my back since but the Corporal-GeneralSeventh Cavalry and Flag-Lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons, U.S.A.,- on whom be peace!"
"Amen.  I listen - tell me more."
"She set to work and organized the Sixteen, and called it the FirstBattalion Rocky Mountain Rangers, U.S.A., and she wanted to bebugler, but they elected her Lieutenant-General and Bugler.  So sheranks her uncle the commandant, who is only a Brigadier.  Anddoesn't she train those little people!  Ask the Indians, ask thetraders, ask the soldiers; they'll tell you.  She has been at itfrom the first day.  Every morning they go clattering down into theplain, and there she sits on my back with her bugle at her mouthand sounds the orders and puts them through the evolutions for anhour or more; and it is too beautiful for anything to see thoseponies dissolve from one formation into another, and waltz about,and break, and scatter, and form again, always moving, alwaysgraceful, now trotting, now galloping, and so on, sometimes nearby, sometimes in the distance, all just like a state ball, youknow, and sometimes she can't hold herself any longer, but soundsthe 'charge,' and turns me loose! and you can take my word for it,if the battalion hasn't too much of a start we catch up and go overthe breastworks with the front line.
"Yes, they are soldiers, those little people; and healthy, too, notailing any more, the way they used to be sometimes.  It's becauseof her drill.  She's got a fort, now - Fort Fanny Marsh.  Major-General Tommy Drake planned it out, and the Seventh and Dragoonsbuilt it.  Tommy is the Colonel's son, and is fifteen and theoldest in the Battalion; Fanny Marsh is Brigadier-General, and isnext oldest - over thirteen.  She is daughter of Captain Marsh,Company B, Seventh Cavalry.  Lieutenant-General Alison is theyoungest by considerable; I think she is about nine and a half orthree-quarters.  Her military rig, as Lieutenant-General, isn't forbusiness, it's for dress parade, because the ladies made it.  Theysay they got it out of the Middle Ages - out of a book - and it isall red and blue and white silks and satins and velvets; tights,trunks, sword, doublet with slashed sleeves, short cape, cap withjust one feather in it; I've heard them name these things; they gotthem out of the book; she's dressed like a page, of old times, theysay.  It's the daintiest outfit that ever was - you will say so,when you see it.  She's lovely in it - oh, just a dream!  In someways she is just her age, but in others she's as old as her uncle,I think.  She is very learned.  She teaches her uncle his book.  Ihave seen her sitting by with the book and reciting to him what isin it, so that he can learn to do it himself.
"Every Saturday she hires little Injuns to garrison her fort; thenshe lays siege to it, and makes military approaches by make-believetrenches in make-believe night, and finally at make-believe dawnshe draws her sword and sounds the assault and takes it by storm.It is for practice.  And she has invented a bugle-call all byherself, out of her own head, and it's a stirring one, and theprettiest in the service.  It's to call ME - it's never used foranything else.  She taught it to me, and told me what it says:  'ITIS I, SOLDIER - COME!' and when those thrilling notes come floatingdown the distance I hear them without fail, even if I am two milesaway; and then - oh, then you should see my heels get down tobusiness!
"And she has taught me how to say good-morning and good-night toher, which is by lifting my right hoof for her to shake; and alsohow to say good-bye; I do that with my left foot - but only forpractice, because there hasn't been any but make-believe good-byeing yet, and I hope there won't ever be.  It would make me cryif I ever had to put up my left foot in earnest.  She has taught mehow to salute, and I can do it as well as a soldier.  I bow my headlow, and lay my right hoof against my cheek.  She taught me thatbecause I got into disgrace once, through ignorance.  I amprivileged, because I am known to be honorable and trustworthy, andbecause I have a distinguished record in the service; so they don'thobble me nor tie me to stakes or shut me tight in stables, but letme wander around to suit myself.  Well, trooping the colors is avery solemn ceremony, and everybody must stand uncovered when theflag goes by, the commandant and all; and once I was there, andignorantly walked across right in front of the band, which was anawful disgrace:  Ah, the Lieutenant-General was so ashamed, and sodistressed that I should have done such a thing before all theworld, that she couldn't keep the tears back; and then she taughtme the salute, so that if I ever did any other unmilitary actthrough ignorance I could do my salute and she believed everybodywould think it was apology enough and would not press the matter.It is very nice and distinguished; no other horse can do it; oftenthe men salute me, and I return it.  I am privileged to be presentwhen the Rocky Mountain Rangers troop the colors and I standsolemn, like the children, and I salute when the flag goes by.  Ofcourse when she goes to her fort her sentries sing out 'Turn outthe guard!' and then . . . do you catch that refreshing early-morning whiff from the mountain-pines and the wild flowers?  Thenight is far spent; we'll hear the bugles before long.  Dorcas, theblack woman, is very good and nice; she takes care of theLieutenant-General, and is Brigadier-General Alison's mother, whichmakes her mother-in-law to the Lieutenant-General.  That is whatShekels says.  At least it is what I think he says, though I nevercan understand him quite clearly. He - "
"Who is Shekels?"
"The Seventh Cavalry dog.  I mean, if he IS a dog.  His father wasa coyote and his mother was a wild-cat.  It doesn't really make adog out of him, does it?"
"Not a real dog, I should think.  Only a kind of a general dog, atmost, I reckon.  Though this is a matter of ichthyology, I suppose;and if it is, it is out of my depth, and so my opinion is notvaluable, and I don't claim much consideration for it."
"It isn't ichthyology; it is dogmatics, which is still moredifficult and tangled up.  Dogmatics always are."
"Dogmatics is quite beyond me, quite; so I am not competing.  Buton general principles it is my opinion that a colt out of a coyoteand a wild-cat is no square dog, but doubtful.  That is my hand,and I stand pat."
"Well, it is as far as I can go myself, and be fair andconscientious.  I have always regarded him as a doubtful dog, andso has Potter.  Potter is the great Dane.  Potter says he is nodog, and not even poultry - though I do not go quite so far asthat.
"And I wouldn't, myself.  Poultry is one of those things which noperson can get to the bottom of, there is so much of it and suchvariety.  It is just wings, and wings, and wings, till you areweary:  turkeys, and geese, and bats, and butterflies, and angels,and grasshoppers, and flying-fish, and - well, there is really noend to the tribe; it gives me the heaves just to think of it.  Butthis one hasn't any wings, has he?"
"No."
"Well, then, in my belief he is more likely to be dog than poultry.I have not heard of poultry that hadn't wings.  Wings is the SIGNof poultry; it is what you tell poultry by.  Look at the mosquito."
"What do you reckon he is, then?  He must be something."
"Why, he could be a reptile; anything that hasn't wings is areptile."
"Who told you that?"
"Nobody told me, but I overheard it."
"Where did you overhear it?"
"Years ago.  I was with the Philadelphia Institute expedition inthe Bad Lands under Professor Cope, hunting mastodon bones, and Ioverheard him say, his own self, that any plantigrade circumflexvertebrate bacterium that hadn't wings and was uncertain was areptile.  Well, then, has this dog any wings?  No.  Is he aplantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium?  Maybe so, maybe not;but without ever having seen him, and judging only by his illegaland spectacular parentage, I will bet the odds of a bale of hay toa bran mash that he looks it.  Finally, is he uncertain?  That isthe point - is he uncertain?  I will leave it to you if you haveever heard of a more uncertainer dog than what this one is?"
"No, I never have."
"Well, then, he's a reptile.  That's settled."
"Why, look here, whatsyourname"
"Last alias, Mongrel."
"A good one, too.  I was going to say, you are better educated thanyou have been pretending to be.  I like cultured society, and Ishall cultivate your acquaintance.  Now as to Shekels, whenever youwant to know about any private thing that is going on at this postor in White Cloud's camp or Thunder-Bird's, he can tell you; and ifyou make friends with him he'll be glad to, for he is a borngossip, and picks up all the tittle-tattle.  Being the wholeSeventh Cavalry's reptile, he doesn't belong to anybody inparticular, and hasn't any military duties; so he comes and goes ashe pleases, and is popular with all the house cats and otherauthentic sources of private information.  He understands all thelanguages, and talks them all, too.  With an accent like grittingyour teeth, it is true, and with a grammar that is no improvementon blasphemy - still, with practice you get at the meat of what hesays, and it serves. . . Hark!  That's the reveille. . . .
[THE REVEILLE]
"Faint and far, but isn't it clear, isn't it sweet?  There's nomusic like the bugle to stir the blood, in the still solemnity ofthe morning twilight, with the dim plain stretching away to nothingand the spectral mountains slumbering against the sky.  You'll hearanother note in a minute - faint and far and clear, like the otherone, and sweeter still, you'll notice.  Wait . . . listen.  Thereit goes!  It says, 'IT IS I, SOLDIER - COME!' . . .
[SOLDIER BOY'S BUGLE CALL]
. . . Now then, watch me leave a blue streak behind!"
