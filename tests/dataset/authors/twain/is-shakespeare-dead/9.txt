Did Francis Bacon write Shakespeare's Works?
Nobody knows.
We cannot say we KNOW a thing when that thing has not been proved.KNOW is too strong a word to use when the evidence is not final andabsolutely conclusive. We can infer, if we want to, like thoseslaves . . . No, I will not write that word, it is not kind, it isnot courteous. The upholders of the Stratford-Shakespearesuperstition call US the hardest names they can think of, and theykeep doing it all the time; very well, if they like to descend tothat level, let them do it, but I will not so undignify myself asto follow them. I cannot call them harsh names; the most I can dois to indicate them by terms reflecting my disapproval; and thiswithout malice, without venom.
To resume. What I was about to say, was, those thugs have builttheir entire superstition upon INFERENCES, not upon known andestablished facts. It is a weak method, and poor, and I am glad tobe able to say our side never resorts to it while there is anythingelse to resort to.
But when we must, we must; and we have now arrived at a place ofthat sort.
Since the Stratford Shakespeare couldn't have written the Works, weinfer that somebody did. Who was it, then? This requires somemore inferring.
Ordinarily when an unsigned poem sweeps across the continent like atidal wave, whose roar and boom and thunder are made up ofadmiration, delight and applause, a dozen obscure people rise upand claim the authorship. Why a dozen, instead of only one or two?One reason is, because there's a dozen that are recognizablycompetent to do that poem. Do you remember "Beautiful Snow"? Doyou remember "Rock Me to Sleep, Mother, Rock Me to Sleep"? Do youremember "Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy flight! Make mea child again just for to-night"? I remember them very well.Their authorship was claimed by most of the grown-up people whowere alive at the time, and every claimant had one plausibleargument in his favor, at least: to wit, he could have done theauthoring; he was competent.
Have the Works been claimed by a dozen? They haven't. There wasgood reason. The world knows there was but one man on the planetat the time who was competent--not a dozen, and not two. A longtime ago the dwellers in a far country used now and then to find aprocession of prodigious footprints stretching across the plain--footprints that were three miles apart, each footprint a third of amile long and a furlong deep, and with forests and villages mashedto mush in it. Was there any doubt as to who had made that mightytrail? Were there a dozen claimants? Were there two? No--thepeople knew who it was that had been along there: there was onlyone Hercules.
There has been only one Shakespeare. There couldn't be two;certainly there couldn't be two at the same time. It takes ages tobring forth a Shakespeare, and some more ages to match him. Thisone was not matched before his time; nor during his time; andhasn't been matched since. The prospect of matching him in ourtime is not bright.
The Baconians claim that the Stratford Shakespeare was notqualified to write the Works, and that Francis Bacon was. Theyclaim that Bacon possessed the stupendous equipment--both naturaland acquired--for the miracle; and that no other Englishman of hisday possessed the like; or, indeed, anything closely approachingit.
Macaulay, in his Essay, has much to say about the splendor andhorizonless magnitude of that equipment. Also, he has synopsizedBacon's history: a thing which cannot be done for the StratfordShakespeare, for he hasn't any history to synopsize. Bacon'shistory is open to the world, from his boyhood to his death in oldage--a history consisting of known facts, displayed in minute andmultitudinous detail; FACTS, not guesses and conjectures and might-have-beens.
Whereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen, and hada Lord Chancellor for his father, and a mother who was"distinguished both as a linguist and a theologian: shecorresponded in Greek with Bishop Jewell, and translated hisApologia from the Latin so correctly that neither he nor ArchbishopParker could suggest a single alteration." It is the atmosphere weare reared in that determines how our inclinations and aspirationsshall tend. The atmosphere furnished by the parents to the son inthis present case was an atmosphere saturated with learning; withthinkings and ponderings upon deep subjects; and with politeculture. It had its natural effect. Shakespeare of Stratford wasreared in a house which had no use for books, since its owners, hisparents, were without education. This may have had an effect uponthe son, but we do not know, because we have no history of him ofan informing sort. There were but few books anywhere, in that day,and only the well-to-do and highly educated possessed them, theybeing almost confined to the dead languages. "All the valuablebooks then extant in all the vernacular dialects of Europe wouldhardly have filled a single shelf"--imagine it! The few existingbooks were in the Latin tongue mainly. "A person who was ignorantof it was shut out from all acquaintance--not merely with Ciceroand Virgil, but with the most interesting memoirs, state papers,and pamphlets of his own time"--a literature necessary to theStratford lad, for his fictitious reputation's sake, since thewriter of his Works would begin to use it wholesale and in a mostmasterly way before the lad was hardly more than out of his teensand into his twenties.
At fifteen Bacon was sent to the university, and he spent threeyears there. Thence he went to Paris in the train of the EnglishAmbassador, and there he mingled daily with the wise, the cultured,the great, and the aristocracy of fashion, during another threeyears. A total of six years spent at the sources of knowledge;knowledge both of books and of men. The three spent at theuniversity were coeval with the second and last three spent by thelittle Stratford lad at Stratford school supposedly, andperhapsedly, and maybe, and by inference--with nothing to inferfrom. The second three of the Baconian six were "presumably" spentby the Stratford lad as apprentice to a butcher. That is, thethugs presume it--on no evidence of any kind. Which is their way,when they want a historical fact. Fact and presumption are, forbusiness purposes, all the same to them. They know the difference,but they also know how to blink it. They know, too, that while inhistory-building a fact is better than a presumption, it doesn'ttake a presumption long to bloom into a fact when THEY have thehandling of it. They know by old experience that when they gethold of a presumption-tadpole he is not going to STAY tadpole intheir history-tank; no, they know how to develop him into the giantfour-legged bullfrog of FACT, and make him sit up on his hams, andpuff out his chin, and look important and insolent and come-to-stay; and assert his genuine simon-pure authenticity with athundering bellow that will convince everybody because it is soloud. The thug is aware that loudness convinces sixty personswhere reasoning convinces but one. I wouldn't be a thug, not evenif--but never mind about that, it has nothing to do with theargument, and it is not noble in spirit besides. If I am betterthan a thug, is the merit mine? No, it is His. Then to Him be thepraise. That is the right spirit.
They "presume" the lad severed his "presumed" connection with theStratford school to become apprentice to a butcher. They also"presume" that the butcher was his father. They don't know. Thereis no written record of it, nor any other actual evidence. If itwould have helped their case any, they would have apprenticed himto thirty butchers, to fifty butchers, to a wilderness of butchers--all by their patented method "presumption." If it will help theircase they will do it yet; and if it will further help it, they will"presume" that all those butchers were his father. And the weekafter, they will SAY it. Why, it is just like being the past tenseof the compound reflexive adverbial incandescent hypodermicirregular accusative Noun of Multitude; which is father to theexpression which the grammarians call Verb. It is like a wholeancestry, with only one posterity.
To resume. Next, the young Bacon took up the study of law, andmastered that abstruse science. From that day to the end of hislife he was daily in close contact with lawyers and judges; not asa casual onlooker in intervals between holding horses in front of atheatre, but as a practicing lawyer--a great and successful one, arenowned one, a Launcelot of the bar, the most formidable lance inthe high brotherhood of the legal Table Round; he lived in thelaw's atmosphere thenceforth, all his years, and by sheer abilityforced his way up its difficult steeps to its supremest summit, theLord Chancellorship, leaving behind him no fellow craftsmanqualified to challenge his divine right to that majestic place.
When we read the praises bestowed by Lord Penzance and the otherillustrious experts upon the legal condition and legal aptnesses,brilliances, profundities and felicities so prodigally displayed inthe Plays, and try to fit them to the history-less Stratford stage-manager, they sound wild, strange, incredible, ludicrous; but whenwe put them in the mouth of Bacon they do not sound strange, theyseem in their natural and rightful place, they seem at home there.Please turn back and read them again. Attributed to Shakespeare ofStratford they are meaningless, they are inebriate extravagancies--intemperate admirations of the dark side of the moon, so to speak;attributed to Bacon, they are admirations of the golden glories ofthe moon's front side, the moon at the full--and not intemperate,not overwrought, but sane and right, and justified. "At every turnand point at which the author required a metaphor, simile orillustration, his mind ever turned FIRST to the law; he seemsalmost to have THOUGHT in legal phrases; the commonest legalphrases, the commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end ofhis pen." That could happen to no one but a person whose TRADE wasthe law; it could not happen to a dabbler in it. Veteran marinersfill their conversation with sailor-phrases and draw all theirsimiles from the ship and the sea and the storm, but no merePASSENGER ever does it, be he of Stratford or elsewhere; or coulddo it with anything resembling accuracy, if he were hardy enough totry. Please read again what Lord Campbell and the other greatauthorities have said about Bacon when they thought they weresaying it about Shakespeare of Stratford.
