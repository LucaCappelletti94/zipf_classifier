   I look at the swaling sunset	 And wish I could go also	Through the red doors beyond the black-purple bar.	  I wish that I could go	Through the red doors where I could put off  My shame like shoes in the porch,	 My pain like garments,	And leave my flesh discarded lying	Like luggage of some departed traveller	 Gone one knows not where.   Then I would turn round,	And seeing my cast-off body lying like lumber,	 I would laugh with joy.
