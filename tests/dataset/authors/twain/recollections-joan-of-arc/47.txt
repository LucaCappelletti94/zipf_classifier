We Win, But the King Balks
IT WAS away past midnight, and had been a tremendous day in the matter ofexcitement and fatigue, but that was no matter to Joan when there wasbusiness on hand. She did not think of bed. The generals followed her toher official quarters, and she delivered her orders to them as fast asshe could talk, and they sent them off to their different commands asfast as delivered; wherefore the messengers galloping hither and thitherraised a world of clatter and racket in the still streets; and soon wereadded to this the music of distant bugles and the roll of drums--notes ofpreparation; for the vanguard would break camp at dawn.
The generals were soon dismissed, but I wasn't; nor Joan; for it was myturn to work, now. Joan walked the floor and dictated a summons to theDuke of Burgundy to lay down his arms and make peace and exchange pardonswith the King; or, if he must fight, go fight the Saracens."Pardonnez-vous l'un Â… l'autre de bon coeligeur, entierement, ainsi quedoivent faire loyaux chretiens, et, s'il vous plait de guerroyer, allezcontre les Sarrasins." It was long, but it was good, and had the sterlingring to it. It is my opinion that it was as fine and simple andstraightforward and eloquent a state paper as she ever uttered.
It was delivered into the hands of a courier, and he galloped away withit. The Joan dismissed me, and told me to go to the inn and stay, and inthe morning give to her father the parcel which she had left there. Itcontained presents for the Domremy relatives and friends and a peasantdress which she had bought for herself. She said she would say good-by toher father and uncle in the morning if it should still be their purposeto go, instead of tarrying awhile to see the city.
I didn't say anything, of course, but I could have said that wild horsescouldn't keep those men in that town half a day. They waste the glory ofbeing the first to carry the great news to Domremy--the taxes remittedforever!--and hear the bells clang and clatter, and the people cheer andshout? Oh, not they. Patay and Orleans and the Coronation were eventswhich in a vague way these men understood to be colossal; but they werecolossal mists, films, abstractions; this was a gigantic reality!
When I got there, do you suppose they were abed! Quite the reverse. Theyand the rest were as mellow as mellow could be; and the Paladin was doinghis battles in great style, and the old peasants were endangering thebuilding with their applause. He was doing Patay now; and was bending hisbig frame forward and laying out the positions and movements with a rakehere and a rake there of his formidable sword on the floor, and thepeasants were stooped over with their hands on their spread kneesobserving with excited eyes and ripping out ejaculations of wonder andadmiration all along:
"Yes, here we were, waiting--waiting for the word; our horses fidgetingand snorting and dancing to get away, we lying back on the bridles tillour bodies fairly slanted to the rear; the word rang out at last--'Go!'and we went!
"Went? There was nothing like it ever seen! Where we swept by squads ofscampering English, the mere wind of our passage laid them flat in pilesand rows! Then we plunged into the ruck of Fastolfe's franticbattle-corps and tore through it like a hurricane, leaving a causeway ofthe dead stretching far behind; no tarrying, no slacking rein, but on!on! on! far yonder in the distance lay our prey--Talbot and his hostlooming vast and dark like a storm-cloud brooding on the sea! Down weswooped upon them, glooming all the air with a quivering pall of deadleaves flung up by the whirlwind of our flight. In another moment weshould have struck them as world strikes world when disorbitedconstellations crash into the Milky way, but by misfortune and theinscrutable dispensation of God I was recognized! Talbot turned white,and shouting, 'Save yourselves, it is the Standard-Bearer of Joan ofArc!' drove his spurs home till they met in the middle of his horse'sentrails, and fled the field with his billowing multitudes at his back! Icould have cursed myself for not putting on a disguise. I saw reproach inthe eyes of her Excellency, and was bitterly ashamed. I had caused whatseemed an irreparable disaster. Another might have gone aside to grieve,as not seeing any way to mend it; but I thank God I am not of those.Great occasions only summon as with a trumpet-call the slumberingreserves of my intellect. I saw my opportunity in an instant--in the nextI was away! Through the woods I vanished--fst!--like an extinguishedlight! Away around through the curtaining forest I sped, as if on wings,none knowing what was become of me, none suspecting my design. Minuteafter minute passed, on and on I flew; on, and still on; and at last witha great cheer I flung my Banner to the breeze and burst out in front ofTalbot! Oh, it was a mighty thought! That weltering chaos of distractedmen whirled and surged backward like a tidal wave which has struck acontinent, and the day was ours! Poor helpless creatures, they were in atrap; they were surrounded; they could not escape to the rear, for therewas our army; they could not escape to the front, for there was I. Theirhearts shriveled in their bodies, their hands fell listless at theirsides. They stood still, and at our leisure we slaughtered them to a man;all except Talbot and Fastolfe, whom I saved and brought away, one undereach arm."
Well, there is no denying it, the Paladin was in great form that night.Such style! such noble grace of gesture, such grandeur of attitude, suchenergy when he got going! such steady rise, on such sure wing, suchnicely graduated expenditures of voice according to the weight of thematter, such skilfully calculated approaches to his surprises andexplosions, such belief-compelling sincerity of tone and manner, such aclimaxing peal from his brazen lungs, and such a lightning-vivid pictureof his mailed form and flaunting banner when he burst out before thatdespairing army! And oh, the gentle art of the last half of his lastsentence--delivered in the careless and indolent tone of one who hasfinished his real story, and only adds a colorless and inconsequentialdetail because it has happened to occur to him in a lazy way.
It was a marvel to see those innocent peasants. Why, they went all topieces with enthusiasm, and roared out applauses fit to raise the roofand wake the dead. When they had cooled down at last and there wassilence but for the heaving and panting, old Laxart said, admiringly:
"As it seems to me, you are an army in your single person."
"Yes, that is what he is," said Noel Rainguesson, convincingly. "He is aterror; and not just in this vicinity. His mere name carries a shudderwith it to distant lands--just he mere name; and when he frowns, theshadow of it falls as far as Rome, and the chickens go to roost an hourbefore schedule time. Yes; and some say--"
"Noel Rainguesson, you are preparing yourself for trouble. I will sayjust one word to you, and it will be to your advantage to--"
I saw that the usual thing had got a start. No man could prophesy when itwould end. So I delivered Joan's message and went off to bed.
Joan made her good-byes to those old fellows in the morning, with lovingembraces and many tears, and with a packed multitude for sympathizers,and they rode proudly away on their precious horses to carry their greatnews home. I had seen better riders, some will say that; for horsemanshipwas a new art to them.
The vanguard moved out at dawn and took the road, with bands braying andbanners flying; the second division followed at eight. Then came theBurgundian ambassadors, and lost us the rest of that day and the whole ofthe next. But Joan was on hand, and so they had their journey for theirpains. The rest of us took the road at dawn, next morning, July 20th. Andgot how far? Six leagues. Tremouille was getting in his sly work with thevacillating King, you see. The King stopped at St. Marcoul and prayedthree days. Precious time lost--for us; precious time gained for Bedford.He would know how to use it.
We could not go on without the King; that would be to leave him in theconspirators' camp. Joan argued, reasoned, implored; and at last we gotunder way again.
Joan's prediction was verified. It was not a campaign, it was onlyanother holiday excursion. English strongholds lined our route; theysurrendered without a blow; we garrisoned them with Frenchmen and passedon. Bedford was on the march against us with his new army by this time,and on the 25th of July the hostile forces faced each other and madepreparation for battle; but Bedford's good judgment prevailed, and heturned and retreated toward Paris. Now was our chance. Our men were ingreat spirits.
Will you believe it? Our poor stick of a King allowed his worthlessadvisers to persuade him to start back for Gien, whence he had set outwhen we first marched for Rheims and the Coronation! And we actually didstart back. The fifteen-day truce had just been concluded with the Dukeof Burgundy, and we would go and tarry at Gien until he should deliverParis to us without a fight.
We marched to Bray; then the King changed his mind once more, and with ithis face toward Paris. Joan dictated a letter to the citizens of Rheimsto encourage them to keep heart in spite of the truce, and promising tostand by them. She furnished them the news herself that the Kin had madethis truce; and in speaking of it she was her usual frank self. She saidshe was not satisfied with it, and didn't know whether she would keep itor not; that if she kept it, it would be solely out of tenderness for theKing's honor. All French children know those famous words. How naive theyare! "De cette treve qui a ete faite, je ne suis pas contente, et je nesais si je la tiendrai. Si je la tiens, ce sera seulement pour garderl'honneur du roi." But in any case, she said, she would not allow theblood royal to be abused, and would keep the army in good order and readyfor work at the end of the truce.
Poor child, to have to fight England, Burgundy, and a French conspiracyall at the same time--it was too bad. She was a match for the others, buta conspiracy--ah, nobody is a match for that, when the victim that is tobe injured is weak and willing. It grieved her, these troubled days, tobe so hindered and delayed and baffled, and at times she was sad and thetears lay near the surface. Once, talking with her good old faithfulfriend and servant, the Bastard of Orleans, she said:
"Ah, if it might but please God to let me put off this steel raiment andgo back to my father and my mother, and tend my sheep again with mysister and my brothers, who would be so glad to see me!"
By the 12th of August we were camped near Dampmartin. Later we had abrush with Bedford's rear-guard, and had hopes of a big battle on themorrow, but Bedford and all his force got away in the night and went ontoward Paris.
Charles sent heralds and received the submission of Beauvais. The BishopPierre Cauchon, that faithful friend and slave of the English, was notable to prevent it, though he did his best. He was obscure then, but hisname was to travel round the globe presently, and live forever in thecurses of France! Bear with me now, while I spit in fancy upon his grave.
Compiegne surrendered, and hauled down the English flag. On the 14th wecamped two leagues from Senlis. Bedford turned and approached, and tookup a strong position. We went against him, but all our efforts to beguilehim out from his intrenchments failed, though he had promised us a duelin the open field. Night shut down. Let him look our for the morning! Butin the morning he was gone again.
We entered Compiegne the 18th of August, turning out the English garrisonand hoisting our own flag.
On the 23d Joan gave command to move upon Paris. The King and the cliquewere not satisfied with this, and retired sulking to Senlis, which hadjust surrendered. Within a few days many strong places submitted--Creil,Pont-Saint-Maxence, Choisy, Gournay-sur-Aronde, Remy, LeNeufville-en-Hez, Moguay, Chantilly, Saintines. The English power wastumbling, crash after crash! And still the King sulked and disapproved,and was afraid of our movement against the capital.
On the 26th of August, 1429, Joan camped at St. Denis; in effect, underthe walls of Paris.
And still the King hung back and was afraid. If we could but have had himthere to back us with his authority! Bedford had lost heart and decidedto waive resistance and go an concentrate his strength in the best andloyalest province remaining to him--Normandy. Ah, if we could only havepersuaded the King to come and countenance us with his presence andapproval at this supreme moment!
