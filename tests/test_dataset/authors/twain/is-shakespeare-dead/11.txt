Am I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not writeShakespeare's Works? Ah, now, what do you take me for? Would I beso soft as that, after having known the human race familiarly fornearly seventy-four years? It would grieve me to know that any onecould think so injuriously of me, so uncomplimentarily, sounadmiringly of me. No-no, I am aware that when even the brightestmind in our world has been trained up from childhood in asuperstition of any kind, it will never be possible for that mind,in its maturity, to examine sincerely, dispassionately, andconscientiously any evidence or any circumstance which shall seemto cast a doubt upon the validity of that superstition. I doubt ifI could do it myself. We always get at second hand our notionsabout systems of government; and high-tariff and low-tariff; andprohibition and anti-prohibition; and the holiness of peace and theglories of war; and codes of honor and codes of morals; andapproval of the duel and disapproval of it; and our beliefsconcerning the nature of cats; and our ideas as to whether themurder of helpless wild animals is base or is heroic; and ourpreferences in the matter of religious and political parties; andour acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares and the ArthurOrtons and the Mrs. Eddys. We get them all at second-hand, wereason none of them out for ourselves. It is the way we are made.It is the way we are all made, and we can't help it, we can'tchange it. And whenever we have been furnished a fetish, and havebeen taught to believe in it, and love it and worship it, andrefrain from examining it, there is no evidence, howsoever clearand strong, that can persuade us to withdraw from it our loyaltyand our devotion. In morals, conduct, and beliefs we take thecolor of our environment and associations, and it is a color thatcan safely be warranted to wash. Whenever we have been furnishedwith a tar baby ostensibly stuffed with jewels, and warned that itwill be dishonorable and irreverent to disembowel it and test thejewels, we keep our sacrilegious hands off it. We submit, notreluctantly, but rather gladly, for we are privately afraid weshould find, upon examination, that the jewels are of the sort thatare manufactured at North Adams, Mass.
I haven't any idea that Shakespeare will have to vacate hispedestal this side of the year 2209. Disbelief in him cannot comeswiftly, disbelief in a healthy and deeply-loved tar baby has neverbeen known to disintegrate swiftly, it is a very slow process. Ittook several thousand years to convince our fine race--includingevery splendid intellect in it--that there is no such thing as awitch; it has taken several thousand years to convince that samefine race--including every splendid intellect in it--that there isno such person as Satan; it has taken several centuries to removeperdition from the Protestant Church's program of postmortementertainments; it has taken a weary long time to persuade AmericanPresbyterians to give up infant damnation and try to bear it thebest they can; and it looks as if their Scotch brethren will stillbe burning babies in the everlasting fires when Shakespeare comesdown from his perch.
We are The Reasoning Race. We can't prove it by the aboveexamples, and we can't prove it by the miraculous "histories" builtby those Stratfordolaters out of a hatful of rags and a barrel ofsawdust, but there is a plenty of other things we can prove it by,if I could think of them. We are The Reasoning Race, and when wefind a vague file of chipmunk-tracks stringing through the dust ofStratford village, we know by our reasoning powers that Herculeshas been along there. I feel that our fetish is safe for threecenturies yet. The bust, too--there in the Stratford Church. Theprecious bust, the priceless bust, the calm bust, the serene bust,the emotionless bust, with the dandy moustache, and the putty face,unseamed of care--that face which has looked passionlessly downupon the awed pilgrim for a hundred and fifty years and will stilllook down upon the awed pilgrim three hundred more, with the deep,deep, deep, subtle, subtle, subtle, expression of a bladder.
