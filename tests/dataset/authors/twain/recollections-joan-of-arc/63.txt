Joan Struggles with Her Twelve Lies
WE WERE now in the first days of April. Joan was ill. She had fallen illthe 29th of March, the day after the close of the third trial, and wasgrowing worse when the scene which I have just described occurred in hercell. It was just like Cauchon to go there and try to get some advantageout of her weakened state.
Let us note some of the particulars in the new indictment--the TwelveLies.
Part of the first one says Joan asserts that she has found her salvation.She never said anything of the kind. It also says she refuses to submitherself to the Church. Not true. She was willing to submit all her actsto this Rouen tribunal except those done by the command of God infulfilment of her mission. Those she reserved for the judgment of God.She refused to recognize Cauchon and his serfs as the Church, but waswilling to go before the Pope or the Council of Basel.
A clause of another of the Twelve says she admits having threatened withdeath those who would not obey her. Distinctly false. Another clause saysshe declares that all she has done has been done by command of God. Whatshe really said was, all that she had done well--a correction made byherself as you have already seen.
Another of the Twelve says she claims that she has never committed anysin. She never made any such claim.
Another makes the wearing of the male dress a sin. If it was, she hadhigh Catholic authority for committing it--that of the Archbishop ofRheims and the tribunal of Poitiers.
The Tenth Article was resentful against her for "pretending" that St.Catherine and St.
Marguerite spoke French and not English, and were French in theirpolitics.
The Twelve were to be submitted first to the learned doctors of theologyof the University of Paris for approval. They were copied out and readyby the night of April 4th. Then Manchon did another bold thing: he wrotein the margin that many of the Twelve put statements in Joan's mouthwhich were the exact opposite of what she had said. That fact would notbe considered important by the University of Paris, and would notinfluence its decision or stir its humanity, in case it had any--which ithadn't when acting in a political capacity, as at present--but it was abrave thing for that good Manchon to do, all the same.
The Twelve were sent to Paris next day, April 5th. That afternoon therewas a great tumult in Rouen, and excited crowds were flocking through allthe chief streets, chattering and seeking for news; for a report had goneabroad that Joan of Arc was sick until death. In truth, these longseances had worn her out, and she was ill indeed. The heads of theEnglish party were in a state of consternation; for if Joan should dieuncondemned by the Church and go to the grave unsmirched, the pity andthe love of the people would turn her wrongs and sufferings and deathinto a holy martyrdom, and she would be even a mightier power in Francedead than she had been when alive.
The Earl of Warwick and the English Cardinal (Winchester) hurried to thecastle and sent messengers flying for physicians. Warwick was a hard man,a rude, coarse man, a man without compassion. There lay the sick girlstretched in her chains in her iron cage--not an object to move man toungentle speech, one would think; yet Warwick spoke right out in herhearing and said to the physicians:
"Mind you take good care of her. The King of England has no mind to haveher die a natural death. She is dear to him, for he bought her dear, andhe does not want her to die, save at the stake. Now then, mind you cureher."
The doctors asked Joan what had made her ill. She said the Bishop ofBeauvais had sent her a fish and she thought it was that.
Then Jean d'Estivet burst out on her, and called her names and abusedher. He understood Joan to be charging the Bishop with poisoning her, yousee; and that was not pleasing to him, for he was one of Cauchon's mostloving and conscienceless slaves, and it outraged him to have Joan injurehis master in the eyes of these great English chiefs, these being men whocould ruin Cauchon and would promptly do it if they got the convictionthat he was capable of saving Joan from the stake by poisoning her andthus cheating the English out of all the real value gainable by herpurchase from the Duke of Burgundy.
Joan had a high fever, and the doctors proposed to bleed her. Warwicksaid:
"Be careful about that; she is smart and is capable of killing herself."
He meant that to escape the stake she might undo the bandage and letherself bleed to death.
But the doctors bled her anyway, and then she was better.
Not for long, though. Jean d'Estivet could not hold still, he was soworried and angry about the suspicion of poisoning which Joan had hintedat; so he came back in the evening and stormed at her till he brought thefever all back again.
When Warwick heard of this he was in a fine temper, you may be sure, forhere was his prey threatening to escape again, and all through theover-zeal of this meddling fool. Warwick gave D'Estivet a quite admirablecursing--admirable as to strength, I mean, for it was said by persons ofculture that the art of it was not good--and after that the meddler keptstill.
Joan remained ill more than two weeks; then she grew better. She wasstill very weak, but she could bear a little persecution now without muchdanger to her life. It seemed to Cauchon a good time to furnish it. So hecalled together some of his doctors of theology and went to her dungeon.Manchon and I went along to keep the record--that is, to set down whatmight be useful to Cauchon, and leave out the rest.
The sight of Joan gave me a shock. Why, she was but a shadow! It wasdifficult for me to realize that this frail little creature with the sadface and drooping form was the same Joan of Arc that I had so often seen,all fire and enthusiasm, charging through a hail of death and thelightning and thunder of the guns at the head of her battalions. It wrungmy heart to see her looking like this.
But Cauchon was not touched. He made another of those consciencelessspeeches of his, all dripping with hypocrisy and guile. He told Joan thatamong her answers had been some which had seemed to endanger religion;and as she was ignorant and without knowledge of the Scriptures, he hadbrought some good and wise men to instruct her, if she desired it. Saidhe, "We are churchmen, and disposed by our good will as well as by ourvocation to procure for you the salvation of your soul and your body, inevery way in our power, just as we would do the like for our nearest kinor for ourselves. In this we but follow the example of Holy Church, whonever closes the refuge of her bosom against any that are willing toreturn."
Joan thanked him for these sayings and said:
"I seem to be in danger of death from this malady; if it be the pleasureof God that I die here, I beg that I may be heard in confession and alsoreceive my Saviour; and that I may be buried in consecrated ground."
Cauchon thought he saw his opportunity at last; this weakened body hadthe fear of an unblessed death before it and the pains of hell to follow.This stubborn spirit would surrender now. So he spoke out and said:
"Then if you want the Sacraments, you must do as all good Catholics do,and submit to the Church."
He was eager for her answer; but when it came there was no surrender init, she still stood to her guns. She turned her head away and saidwearily:
"I have nothing more to say."
Cauchon's temper was stirred, and he raised his voice threateningly andsaid that the more she was in danger of death the more she ought to amendher life; and again he refused the things she begged for unless she wouldsubmit to the Church. Joan said:
"If I die in this prison I beg you to have me buried in holy ground; ifyou will not, I cast myself upon my Saviour."
There was some more conversation of the like sort, then Cauchon demandedagain, and imperiously, that she submit herself and all her deeds to theChurch. His threatening and storming went for nothing. That body wasweak, but the spirit in it was the spirit of Joan of Arc; and out of thatcame the steadfast answer which these people were already so familiarwith and detested so sincerely:
"Let come what may. I will neither do nor say any otherwise than I havesaid already in your tribunals."
Then the good theologians took turn about and worried her with reasoningsand arguments and Scriptures; and always they held the lure of theSacraments before her famishing soul, and tried to bribe her with them tosurrender her mission to the Church's judgment--that is to theirjudgment--as if they were the Church! But it availed nothing. I couldhave told them that beforehand, if they had asked me. But they neverasked me anything; I was too humble a creature for their notice.
Then the interview closed with a threat; a threat of fearful import; athreat calculated to make a Catholic Christian feel as if the ground weresinking from under him:
"The Church calls upon you to submit; disobey, and she will abandon youas if you were a pagan!"
Think of being abandoned by the Church!--that August Power in whose handsis lodged the fate of the human race; whose scepter stretches beyond thefurthest constellation that twinkles in the sky; whose authority is overmillions that live and over the billions that wait trembling in purgatoryfor ransom or doom; whose smile opens the gates of heaven to you, whosefrown delivers you to the fires of everlasting hell; a Power whosedominion overshadows and belittles the pomps and shows of a village. Tobe abandoned by one's King--yes, that is death, and death is much; but tobe abandoned by Rome, to be abandoned by the Church! Ah, death is nothingto that, for that is consignment to endless life--and such a life!
I could see the red waves tossing in that shoreless lake of fire, I couldsee the black myriads of the damned rise out of them and struggle andsink and rise again; and I knew that Joan was seeing what I saw, whileshe paused musing; and I believed that she must yield now, and in truth Ihoped she would, for these men were able to make the threat good anddeliver her over to eternal suffering, and I knew that it was in theirnatures to do it.
But I was foolish to think that thought and hope that hope. Joan of Arcwas not made as others are made. Fidelity to principle, fidelity totruth, fidelity to her word, all these were in her bone and in herflesh--they were parts of her. She could not change, she could not castthem out. She was the very genius of Fidelity; she was Steadfastnessincarnated. Where she had taken her stand and planted her foot, there shewould abide; hell itself could not move her from that place.
Her Voices had not given her permission to make the sort of submissionthat was required, therefore she would stand fast. She would wait, inperfect obedience, let come what might.
My heart was like lead in my body when I went out from that dungeon; butshe--she was serene, she was not troubled. She had done what she believedto be her duty, and that was sufficient; the consequences were not heraffair. The last thing she said that time was full of this serenity, fullof contented repose:
"I am a good Christian born and baptized, and a good Christian I willdie."
