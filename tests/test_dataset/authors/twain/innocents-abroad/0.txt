 PREFACE
This book is a record of a pleasure trip. If it were a record of asolemn scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity, thatprofundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so properto works of that kind, and withal so attractive. Yet notwithstanding itis only a record of a pic-nic, it has a purpose, which is to suggest tothe reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he lookedat them with his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled inthose countries before him. I make small pretense of showing anyone howhe ought to look at objects of interest beyond the sea--other books dothat, and therefore, even if I were competent to do it, there is no need.
I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style oftravel-writing that may be charged against me--for I think I have seen withimpartial eyes, and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whetherwisely or not.
In this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for theDaily Alta California, of San Francisco, the proprietors of that journalhaving waived their rights and given me the necessary permission. I havealso inserted portions of several letters written for the New YorkTribune and the New York Herald.
THE AUTHOR.SAN FRANCISCO.
