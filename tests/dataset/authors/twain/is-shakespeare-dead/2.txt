When I was a Sunday-school scholar something more than sixty yearsago, I became interested in Satan, and wanted to find out all Icould about him. I began to ask questions, but my class-teacher,Mr. Barclay the stone-mason, was reluctant about answering them, itseemed to me. I was anxious to be praised for turning my thoughtsto serious subjects when there wasn't another boy in the villagewho could be hired to do such a thing. I was greatly interested inthe incident of Eve and the serpent, and thought Eve's calmness wasperfectly noble. I asked Mr. Barclay if he had ever heard ofanother woman who, being approached by a serpent, would not excuseherself and break for the nearest timber. He did not answer myquestion, but rebuked me for inquiring into matters above my ageand comprehension. I will say for Mr. Barclay that he was willingto tell me the facts of Satan's history, but he stopped there: hewouldn't allow any discussion of them.
In the course of time we exhausted the facts. There were only fiveor six of them, you could set them all down on a visiting-card. Iwas disappointed. I had been meditating a biography, and wasgrieved to find that there were no materials. I said as much, withthe tears running down. Mr. Barclay's sympathy and compassion werearoused, for he was a most kind and gentle-spirited man, and hepatted me on the head and cheered me up by saying there was a wholevast ocean of materials! I can still feel the happy thrill whichthese blessed words shot through me.
Then he began to bail out that ocean's riches for my encouragementand joy. Like this: it was "conjectured"--though not established--that Satan was originally an angel in heaven; that he fell; thathe rebelled, and brought on a war; that he was defeated, andbanished to perdition. Also, "we have reason to believe" thatlater he did so-and-so; that "we are warranted in supposing" thatat a subsequent time he travelled extensively, seeking whom hemight devour; that a couple of centuries afterward, "as traditioninstructs us," he took up the cruel trade of tempting people totheir ruin, with vast and fearful results; that by-and-by, "as theprobabilities seem to indicate," he may have done certain things,he might have done certain other things, he must have done stillother things.
And so on and so on. We set down the five known facts bythemselves, on a piece of paper, and numbered it "page 1"; then onfifteen hundred other pieces of paper we set down the"conjectures," and "suppositions," and "maybes," and "perhapses,"and "doubtlesses," and "rumors," and "guesses," and"probabilities," and "likelihoods," and "we are permitted tothinks," and "we are warranted in believings," and "might havebeens," and "could have beens," and "must have beens," and"unquestionablys," and "without a shadow of doubts"--and behold!
MATERIALS? Why, we had enough to build a biography of Shakespeare!
Yet he made me put away my pen; he would not let me write thehistory of Satan. Why? Because, as he said, he had suspicions;suspicions that my attitude in this matter was not reverent; andthat a person must be reverent when writing about the sacredcharacters. He said any one who spoke flippantly of Satan would befrowned upon by the religious world and also be brought to account.
I assured him, in earnest and sincere words, that he had whollymisconceived my attitude; that I had the highest respect for Satan,and that my reverence for him equalled, and possibly even exceeded,that of any member of any church. I said it wounded me deeply toperceive by his words that he thought I would make fun of Satan,and deride him, laugh at him, scoff at him: whereas in truth I hadnever thought of such a thing, but had only a warm desire to makefun of those others and laugh at THEM. "What others?" "Why, theSupposers, the Perhapsers, the Might-Have-Beeners, the Could-Have-Beeners, the Must-Have-Beeners, the Without-a-Shadow-of-Doubters,the We-are-Warranted-in-Believingers, and all that funny crop ofsolemn architects who have taken a good solid foundation of fiveindisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it a ConjecturalSatan thirty miles high."
What did Mr. Barclay do then? Was he disarmed? Was he silenced?No. He was shocked. He was so shocked that he visibly shuddered.He said the Satanic Traditioners and Perhapsers and Conjecturerswere THEMSELVES sacred! As sacred as their work. So sacred thatwhoso ventured to mock them or make fun of their work, could notafterward enter any respectable house, even by the back door.
How true were his words, and how wise! How fortunate it would havebeen for me if I had heeded them. But I was young, I was but sevenyears of age, and vain, foolish, and anxious to attract attention.I wrote the biography, and have never been in a respectable housesince.
