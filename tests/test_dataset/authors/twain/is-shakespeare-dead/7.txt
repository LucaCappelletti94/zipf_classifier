If I had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to decidewhether Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare or not, I believe I wouldplace before the debaters only the one question, WAS SHAKESPEAREEVER A PRACTICING LAWYER? and leave everything else out.
It is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not merelymyriad-minded, but also myriad-accomplished: that he not only knewsome thousands of things about human life in all its shades andgrades, and about the hundred arts and trades and crafts andprofessions which men busy themselves in, but that he could TALKabout the men and their grades and trades accurately, making nomistakes. Maybe it is so, but have the experts spoken, or is itonly Tom, Dick, and Harry? Does the exhibit stand upon wide, andloose, and eloquent generalizing--which is not evidence, and notproof--or upon details, particulars, statistics, illustrations,demonstrations?
Experts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely asto only one of Shakespeare's multifarious craft-equipments, so faras my recollections of Shakespeare-Bacon talk abide with me--hislaw-equipment. I do not remember that Wellington or Napoleon everexamined Shakespeare's battles and sieges and strategies, and thendecided and established for good and all, that they were militarilyflawless; I do not remember that any Nelson, or Drake or Cook everexamined his seamanship and said it showed profound and accuratefamiliarity with that art; I don't remember that any king or princeor duke has ever testified that Shakespeare was letter-perfect inhis handling of royal court-manners and the talk and manners ofaristocracies; I don't remember that any illustrious Latinist orGrecian or Frenchman or Spaniard or Italian has proclaimed him apast-master in those languages; I don't remember--well, I don'tremember that there is TESTIMONY--great testimony--imposingtestimony--unanswerable and unattackable testimony as to any ofShakespeare's hundred specialties, except one--the law.
Other things change, with time, and the student cannot trace backwith certainty the changes that various trades and their processesand technicalities have undergone in the long stretch of a centuryor two and find out what their processes and technicalities were inthose early days, but with the law it is different: it is mile-stoned and documented all the way back, and the master of thatwonderful trade, that complex and intricate trade, that awe-compelling trade, has competent ways of knowing whetherShakespeare-law is good law or not; and whether his law-courtprocedure is correct or not, and whether his legal shop-talk is theshop-talk of a veteran practitioner or only a machine-madecounterfeit of it gathered from books and from occasionalloiterings in Westminster.
Richard H. Dana served two years before the mast, and had everyexperience that falls to the lot of the sailor before the mast ofour day. His sailor-talk flows from his pen with the sure touchand the ease and confidence of a person who has LIVED what he istalking about, not gathered it from books and random listenings.Hear him:
Having hove short, cast off the gaskets, and made the bunt of eachsail fast by the jigger, with a man on each yard, at the word thewhole canvas of the ship was loosed, and with the greatest rapiditypossible everything was sheeted home and hoisted up, the anchortripped and cat-headed, and the ship under headway.
Again:
The royal yards were all crossed at once, and royals and sky-sailsset, and, as we had the wind free, the booms were run out, and allwere aloft, active as cats, laying out on the yards and booms,reeving the studding-sail gear; and sail after sail the captainpiled upon her, until she was covered with canvas, her sailslooking like a great white cloud resting upon a black speck.
Once more. A race in the Pacific:
Our antagonist was in her best trim. Being clear of the point, thebreeze became stiff, and the royal-masts bent under our sails, butwe would not take them in until we saw three boys spring into therigging of the California; then they were all furled at once, butwith orders to our boys to stay aloft at the top-gallant mast-headsand loose them again at the word. It was my duty to furl the fore-royal; and while standing by to loose it again, I had a fine viewof the scene. From where I stood, the two vessels seemed nothingbut spars and sails, while their narrow decks, far below, slantingover by the force of the wind aloft, appeared hardly capable ofsupporting the great fabrics raised upon them. The California wasto windward of us, and had every advantage; yet, while the breezewas stiff we held our own. As soon as it began to slacken sheranged a little ahead, and the order was given to loose the royals.In an instant the gaskets were off and the bunt dropped. "Sheethome the fore-royal!"--"Weather sheet's home!"--"Lee sheet'shome!"--"Hoist away, sir!" is bawled from aloft. "Overhaul yourclewlines!" shouts the mate. "Aye-aye, sir, all clear!"--"Tautleech! belay! Well the lee brace; haul taut to windward!" and theroyals are set.
What would the captain of any sailing-vessel of our time say tothat? He would say, "The man that wrote that didn't learn histrade out of a book, he has BEEN there!" But would this samecaptain be competent to sit in judgment upon Shakespeare'sseamanship--considering the changes in ships and ship-talk thathave necessarily taken place, unrecorded, unremembered, and lost tohistory in the last three hundred years? It is my conviction thatShakespeare's sailor-talk would be Choctaw to him. For instance--from The Tempest:
Master. Boatswain!
Boatswain. Here, master; what cheer?
Master. Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely, or we runourselves to ground; bestir, bestir!
(Enter mariners.)
Boatswain. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare,yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master's whistle . . .Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring her to try wi'the main course . . . Lay her a-hold, a-hold! Set her two courses.Off to sea again; lay her off.
That will do, for the present; let us yare a little, now, for achange.
If a man should write a book and in it make one of his characterssay, "Here, devil, empty the quoins into the standing galley andthe imposing stone into the hell-box; assemble the comps around thefrisket and let them jeff for takes and be quick about it," Ishould recognize a mistake or two in the phrasing, and would knowthat the writer was only a printer theoretically, not practically.
I have been a quartz miner in the silver regions--a pretty hardlife; I know all the palaver of that business: I know all aboutdiscovery claims and the subordinate claims; I know all aboutlodes, ledges, outcroppings, dips, spurs, angles, shafts, drifts,inclines, levels, tunnels, air-shafts, "horses," clay casings,granite casings; quartz mills and their batteries; arastras, andhow to charge them with quicksilver and sulphate of copper; and howto clean them up, and how to reduce the resulting amalgam in theretorts, and how to cast the bullion into pigs; and finally I knowhow to screen tailings, and also how to hunt for something lessrobust to do, and find it. I know the argot of the quartz-miningand milling industry familiarly; and so whenever Bret Harteintroduces that industry into a story, the first time one of hisminers opens his mouth I recognize from his phrasing that Harte gotthe phrasing by listening--like Shakespeare--I mean the Stratfordone--not by experience. No one can talk the quartz dialectcorrectly without learning it with pick and shovel and drill andfuse.
I have been a surface-miner--gold--and I know all its mysteries,and the dialect that belongs with them; and whenever Harteintroduces that industry into a story I know by the phrasing of hischaracters that neither he nor they have ever served that trade.
I have been a "pocket" miner--a sort of gold mining not findable inany but one little spot in the world, so far as I know. I knowhow, with horn and water, to find the trail of a pocket and traceit step by step and stage by stage up the mountain to its source,and find the compact little nest of yellow metal reposing in itssecret home under the ground. I know the language of that trade,that capricious trade, that fascinating buried-treasure trade, andcan catch any writer who tries to use it without having learned itby the sweat of his brow and the labor of his hands.
I know several other trades and the argot that goes with them; andwhenever a person tries to talk the talk peculiar to any of themwithout having learned it at its source I can trap him alwaysbefore he gets far on his road.
And so, as I have already remarked, if I were required tosuperintend a Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, I would narrow thematter down to a single question--the only one, so far as theprevious controversies have informed me, concerning whichillustrious experts of unimpeachable competency have testified:WAS THE AUTHOR OF SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS A LAWYER?--a lawyer deeplyread and of limitless experience? I would put aside the guesses,and surmises, and perhapses, and might-have-beens, and could-havebeens, and must-have-beens, and we-are justified-in-presumings, andthe rest of those vague spectres and shadows and indefinitenesses,and stand or fall, win or lose, by the verdict rendered by the juryupon that single question. If the verdict was Yes, I should feelquite convinced that the Stratford Shakespeare, the actor, manager,and trader who died so obscure, so forgotten, so destitute of evenvillage consequence that sixty years afterward no fellow-citizenand friend of his later days remembered to tell anything about him,did not write the Works.
Chapter XIII of The Shakespeare Problem Restated bears the heading"Shakespeare as a Lawyer," and comprises some fifty pages of experttestimony, with comments thereon, and I will copy the first nine,as being sufficient all by themselves, as it seems to me, to settlethe question which I have conceived to be the master-key to theShakespeare-Bacon puzzle.
