A man may have no bad habits and have worse. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The starting point of this lecturing-trip around the world was Paris,where we had been living a year or two.
We sailed for America, and there made certain preparations. This tookbut little time. Two members of my family elected to go with me. Also acarbuncle. The dictionary says a carbuncle is a kind of jewel. Humor isout of place in a dictionary.
We started westward from New York in midsummer, with Major Pond to managethe platform-business as far as the Pacific. It was warm work, all theway, and the last fortnight of it was suffocatingly smoky, for in Oregonand Columbia the forest fires were raging. We had an added week of smokeat the seaboard, where we were obliged awhile for our ship. She had beengetting herself ashore in the smoke, and she had to be docked andrepaired.
We sailed at last; and so ended a snail-paced march across the continent,which had lasted forty days.
We moved westward about mid-afternoon over a rippled and summer sea; anenticing sea, a clean and cool sea, and apparently a welcome sea to allon board; it certainly was to the distressful dustings and smokings andswelterings of the past weeks. The voyage would furnish a three-weeksholiday, with hardly a break in it. We had the whole Pacific Ocean infront of us, with nothing to do but do nothing and be comfortable. Thecity of Victoria was twinkling dim in the deep heart of her smoke-cloud,and getting ready to vanish and now we closed the field-glasses and satdown on our steamer chairs contented and at peace. But they went towreck and ruin under us and brought us to shame before all thepassengers. They had been furnished by the largest furniture-dealinghouse in Victoria, and were worth a couple of farthings a dozen, thoughthey had cost us the price of honest chairs. In the Pacific and IndianOceans one must still bring his own deck-chair on board or go without,just as in the old forgotten Atlantic times--those Dark Ages of seatravel.
Ours was a reasonably comfortable ship, with the customary sea-going fare--plenty of good food furnished by the Deity and cooked by the devil.The discipline observable on board was perhaps as good as it is anywherein the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The ship was not very well arrangedfor tropical service; but that is nothing, for this is the rule for shipswhich ply in the tropics. She had an over-supply of cockroaches, butthis is also the rule with ships doing business in the summer seas--atleast such as have been long in service. Our young captain was a veryhandsome man, tall and perfectly formed, the very figure to show up asmart uniform's best effects. He was a man of the best intentions andwas polite and courteous even to courtliness. There was a soft andfinish about his manners which made whatever place he happened to be inseem for the moment a drawing room. He avoided the smoking room. He hadno vices. He did not smoke or chew tobacco or take snuff; he did notswear, or use slang or rude, or coarse, or indelicate language, or makepuns, or tell anecdotes, or laugh intemperately, or raise his voice abovethe moderate pitch enjoined by the canons of good form. When he gave anorder, his manner modified it into a request. After dinner he and hisofficers joined the ladies and gentlemen in the ladies' saloon, andshared in the singing and piano playing, and helped turn the music. Hehad a sweet and sympathetic tenor voice, and used it with taste andeffect the music he played whist there, always with the same partner andopponents, until the ladies' bedtime. The electric lights burned thereas late as the ladies and their friends might desire; but they were notallowed to burn in the smoking-room after eleven. There were many lawson the ship's statute book of course; but so far as I could see, this andone other were the only ones that were rigidly enforced. The captainexplained that he enforced this one because his own cabin adjoined thesmoking-room, and the smell of tobacco smoke made him sick. I did notsee how our smoke could reach him, for the smoking-room and his cabinwere on the upper deck, targets for all the winds that blew; and besidesthere was no crack of communication between them, no opening of any sortin the solid intervening bulkhead. Still, to a delicate stomach evenimaginary smoke can convey damage.
The captain, with his gentle nature, his polish, his sweetness, his moraland verbal purity, seemed pathetically out of place in his rude andautocratic vocation. It seemed another instance of the irony of fate.
He was going home under a cloud. The passengers knew about his trouble,and were sorry for him. Approaching Vancouver through a narrow anddifficult passage densely befogged with smoke from the forest fires, hehad had the ill-luck to lose his bearings and get his ship on the rocks.A matter like this would rank merely as an error with you and me; itranks as a crime with the directors of steamship companies. The captainhad been tried by the Admiralty Court at Vancouver, and its verdict hadacquitted him of blame. But that was insufficient comfort. A sternercourt would examine the case in Sydney--the Court of Directors, the lordsof a company in whose ships the captain had served as mate a number ofyears. This was his first voyage as captain.
The officers of our ship were hearty and companionable young men, andthey entered into the general amusements and helped the passengers passthe time. Voyages in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are but pleasureexcursions for all hands. Our purser was a young Scotchman who wasequipped with a grit that was remarkable. He was an invalid, and lookedit, as far as his body was concerned, but illness could not subdue hisspirit. He was full of life, and had a gay and capable tongue. To allappearances he was a sick man without being aware of it, for he did nottalk about his ailments, and his bearing and conduct were those of aperson in robust health; yet he was the prey, at intervals, of ghastlysieges of pain in his heart. These lasted many hours, and while theattack continued he could neither sit nor lie. In one instance he stoodon his feet twenty-four hours fighting for his life with these sharpagonies, and yet was as full of life and cheer and activitythe next day as if nothing had happened.
The brightest passenger in the ship, and the most interesting andfelicitous talker, was a young Canadian who was not able to let thewhisky bottle alone. He was of a rich and powerful family, and could havehad a distinguished career and abundance of effective help toward it ifhe could have conquered his appetite for drink; but he could not do it,so his great equipment of talent was of no use to him. He had often takenthe pledge to drink no more, and was a good sample of what that sort ofunwisdom can do for a man--for a man with anything short of an iron will.The system is wrong in two ways: it does not strike at the root of thetrouble, for one thing, and to make a pledge of any kind is to declarewar against nature; for a pledge is a chain that is always clanking andreminding the wearer of it that he is not a free man.
I have said that the system does not strike at the root of the trouble,and I venture to repeat that. The root is not the drinking, but thedesire to drink. These are very different things. The one merelyrequires will--and a great deal of it, both as to bulk and stayingcapacity--the other merely requires watchfulness--and for no long time.The desire of course precedes the act, and should have one's firstattention; it can do but little good to refuse the act over and overagain, always leaving the desire unmolested, unconquered; the desire willcontinue to assert itself, and will be almost sure to win in the longrun. When the desire intrudes, it should be at once banished out of themind. One should be on the watch for it all the time--otherwise it willget in. It must be taken in time and not allowed to get a lodgment. Adesire constantly repulsed for a fortnight should die, then. That shouldcure the drinking habit. The system of refusing the mere act ofdrinking, and leaving the desire in full force, is unintelligent wartactics, it seems to me. I used to take pledges--and soon violate them.My will was not strong, and I could not help it. And then, to be tied inany way naturally irks an otherwise free person and makes him chafe inhis bonds and want to get his liberty. But when I finally ceased fromtaking definite pledges, and merely resolved that I would kill aninjurious desire, but leave myself free to resume the desire and thehabit whenever I should choose to do so, I had no more trouble. In fivedays I drove out the desire to smoke and was not obliged to keep watchafter that; and I never experienced any strong desire to smoke again. Atthe end of a year and a quarter of idleness I began to write a book, andpresently found that the pen was strangely reluctant to go. I tried asmoke to see if that would help me out of the difficulty. It did. Ismoked eight or ten cigars and as many pipes a day for five months;finished the book, and did not smoke again until a year had gone by andanother book had to be begun.
I can quit any of my nineteen injurious habits at any time, and withoutdiscomfort or inconvenience. I think that the Dr. Tanners and thoseothers who go forty days without eating do it by resolutely keeping outthe desire to eat, in the beginning, and that after a few hours thedesire is discouraged and comes no more.
Once I tried my scheme in a large medical way. I had been confined to mybed several days with lumbago. My case refused to improve. Finally thedoctor said,--
"My remedies have no fair chance. Consider what they have to fight,besides the lumbago. You smoke extravagantly, don't you?"
"Yes."
"You take coffee immoderately?"
"Yes."
"And some tea?"
"Yes."
"You eat all kinds of things that are dissatisfied with each other'scompany?"
"Yes."
"You drink two hot Scotches every night?"
"Yes."
"Very well, there you see what I have to contend against. We can't makeprogress the way the matter stands. You must make a reduction in thesethings; you must cut down your consumption of them considerably for somedays."
"I can't, doctor."
"Why can't you."
"I lack the will-power. I can cut them off entirely, but I can't merelymoderate them."
He said that that would answer, and said he would come around intwenty-four hours and begin work again. He was taken ill himself andcould not come; but I did not need him. I cut off all those things fortwo days and nights; in fact, I cut off all kinds of food, too, and alldrinks except water, and at the end of the forty-eight hours the lumbagowas discouraged and left me. I was a well man; so I gave thanks and tookto those delicacies again.
It seemed a valuable medical course, and I recommended it to a lady. Shehad run down and down and down, and had at last reached a point wheremedicines no longer had any helpful effect upon her. I said I knew Icould put her upon her feet in a week. It brightened her up, it filledher with hope, and she said she would do everything I told her to do. SoI said she must stop swearing and drinking, and smoking and eating forfour days, and then she would be all right again. And it would havehappened just so, I know it; but she said she could not stop swearing,and smoking, and drinking, because she had never done those things. Sothere it was. She had neglected her habits, and hadn't any. Now thatthey would have come good, there were none in stock. She had nothing tofall back on. She was a sinking vessel, with no freight in her to throwover lighten ship withal. Why, even one or two little bad habits couldhave saved her, but she was just a moral pauper. When she could haveacquired them she was dissuaded by her parents, who were ignorant peoplethough reared in the best society, and it was too late to begin now. Itseemed such a pity; but there was no help for it. These things ought tobe attended to while a person is young; otherwise, when age and diseasecome, there is nothing effectual to fight them with.
When I was a youth I used to take all kinds of pledges, and do my best tokeep them, but I never could, because I didn't strike at the root of thehabit--the desire; I generally broke down within the month. Once I triedlimiting a habit. That worked tolerably well for a while. I pledgedmyself to smoke but one cigar a day. I kept the cigar waiting untilbedtime, then I had a luxurious time with it. But desire persecuted meevery day and all day long; so, within the week I found myself huntingfor larger cigars than I had been used to smoke; then larger ones still,and still larger ones. Within the fortnight I was getting cigars madefor me--on a yet larger pattern. They still grew and grew in size.Within the month my cigar had grown to such proportions that I could haveused it as a crutch. It now seemed to me that a one-cigar limit was noreal protection to a person, so I knocked my pledge on the head andresumed my liberty.
To go back to that young Canadian. He was a "remittance man," the firstone I had ever seen or heard of. Passengers explained the term to me.They said that dissipated ne'er-do-wells belonging to important familiesin England and Canada were not cast off by their people while there wasany hope of reforming them, but when that last hope perished at last, thene'er-do-well was sent abroad to get him out of the way. He was shippedoff with just enough money in his pocket--no, in the purser's pocket--forthe needs of the voyage--and when he reached his destined port he wouldfind a remittance awaiting him there. Not a large one, but just enoughto keep him a month. A similar remittance would come monthly thereafter.It was the remittance-man's custom to pay his month's board and lodgingstraightway--a duty which his landlord did not allow him to forget--thenspree away the rest of his money in a single night, then brood and mopeand grieve in idleness till the next remittance came. It is a patheticlife.
We had other remittance-men on board, it was said. At least they saidthey were R. M.'s. There were two. But they did not resemble theCanadian; they lacked his tidiness, and his brains, and his gentlemanlyways, and his resolute spirit, and his humanities and generosities. Oneof them was a lad of nineteen or twenty, and he was a good deal of aruin, as to clothes, and morals, and general aspect. He said he was ascion of a ducal house in England, and had been shipped to Canada for thehouse's relief, that he had fallen into trouble there, and was now beingshipped to Australia. He said he had no title. Beyond this remark hewas economical of the truth. The first thing he did in Australia was toget into the lockup, and the next thing he did was to proclaim himself anearl in the police court in the morning and fail to prove it.
