Joan's Five Great Deeds
YES, ORLEANS was in a delirium of felicity. She invited the King, andmade sumptuous preparations to receive him, but--he didn't come. He wassimply a serf at that time, and La Tremouille was his master. Master andserf were visiting together at the master's castle of Sully-sur-Loire.
At Beaugency Joan had engaged to bring about a reconciliation between theConstable Richemont and the King. She took Richemont to Sully-sur-Loireand made her promise good.
The great deeds of Joan of Arc are five:
1. The Raising of the Siege.
2. The Victory of Patay.
3. The Reconciliation at Sully-sur-Loire.
4. The Coronation of the King.
5. The Bloodless March.
We shall come to the Bloodless March presently (and the Coronation). Itwas the victorious long march which Joan made through the enemy's countryfrom Gien to Rheims, and thence to the gates of Paris, capturing everyEnglish town and fortress that barred the road, from the beginning of thejourney to the end of it; and this by the mere force of her name, andwithout shedding a drop of blood--perhaps the most extraordinary campaignin this regard in history--this is the most glorious of her militaryexploits.
The Reconciliation was one of Joan's most important achievements. No oneelse could have accomplished it; and, in fact, no one else of highconsequence had any disposition to try. In brains, in scientific warfare,and in statesmanship the Constable Richemont was the ablest man inFrance. His loyalty was sincere; his probity was above suspicion--(and itmade him sufficiently conspicuous in that trivial and consciencelessCourt).
In restoring Richemont to France, Joan made thoroughly secure thesuccessful completion of the great work which she had begun. She hadnever seen Richemont until he came to her with his little army. Was itnot wonderful that at a glance she should know him for the one man whocould finish and perfect her work and establish it in perpetuity? How wasit that that child was able to do this? It was because she had the"seeing eye," as one of our knights had once said. Yes, she had thatgreat gift--almost the highest and rarest that has been granted to man.Nothing of an extraordinary sort was still to be done, yet the remainingwork could not safely be left to the King's idiots; for it would requirewise statesmanship and long and patient though desultory hammering of theenemy. Now and then, for a quarter of a century yet, there would be alittle fighting to do, and a handy man could carry that on with smalldisturbance to the rest of the country; and little by little, and withprogressive certainty, the English would disappear from France.
And that happened. Under the influence of Richemont the King became at alater time a man--a man, a king, a brave and capable and determinedsoldier. Within six years after Patay he was leading storming partieshimself; fighting in fortress ditches up to his waist in water, andclimbing scaling-ladders under a furious fire with a pluck that wouldhave satisfied even Joan of Arc. In time he and Richemont cleared awayall the English; even from regions where the people had been under theirmastership for three hundred years. In such regions wise and careful workwas necessary, for the English rule had been fair and kindly; and men whohave been ruled in that way are not always anxious for a change.
Which of Joan's five chief deeds shall we call the chiefest? It is mythought that each in its turn was that. This is saying that, taken as awhole, they equalized each other, and neither was then greater than itsmate.
Do you perceive? Each was a stage in an ascent. To leave out one of themwould defeat the journey; to achieve one of them at the wrong time and inthe wrong place would have the same effect.
Consider the Coronation. As a masterpiece of diplomacy, where can youfind its superior in our history? Did the King suspect its vastimportance? No. Did his ministers? No. Did the astute Bedford,representative of the English crown? No. An advantage of incalculableimportance was here under the eyes of the King and of Bedford; the Kingcould get it by a bold stroke, Bedford could get it without an effort;but, being ignorant of its value, neither of them put forth his hand. Ofall the wise people in high office in France, only one knew the pricelessworth of this neglected prize--the untaught child of seventeen, Joan ofArc--and she had known it from the beginning as an essential detail ofher mission.
How did she know it? It was simple: she was a peasant. That tells thewhole story. She was of the people and knew the people; those othersmoved in a loftier sphere and knew nothing much about them. We makelittle account of that vague, formless, inert mass, that mightyunderlying force which we call "the people"--an epithet which carriescontempt with it. It is a strange attitude; for at bottom we know thatthe throne which the people support stands, and that when that support isremoved nothing in this world can save it.
Now, then, consider this fact, and observe its importance. Whatever theparish priest believes his flock believes; they love him, they reverehim; he is their unfailing friend, their dauntless protector, theircomforter in sorrow, their helper in their day of need; he has theirwhole confidence; what he tells them to do, that they will do, with ablind and affectionate obedience, let it cost what it may. Add thesefacts thoughtfully together, and what is the sum? This: The parish priestgoverns the nation. What is the King, then, if the parish priestwithdraws his support and deny his authority? Merely a shadow and noKing; let him resign.
Do you get that idea? Then let us proceed. A priest is consecrated to hisoffice by the awful hand of God, laid upon him by his appointedrepresentative on earth. That consecration is final; nothing can undo it,nothing can remove it. Neither the Pope nor any other power can strip thepriest of his office; God gave it, and it is forever sacred and secure.The dull parish knows all this. To priest and parish, whatsoever isanointed of God bears an office whose authority can no longer be disputedor assailed. To the parish priest, and to his subjects the nation, anuncrowned king is a similitude of a person who has been named for holyorders but has not been consecrated; he has no office, he has not beenordained, another may be appointed to his place. In a word, an uncrownedking is a doubtful king; but if God appoint him and His servant theBishop anoint him, the doubt is annihilated; the priest and the parishare his loyal subjects straightway, and while he lives they willrecognize no king but him.
To Joan of Arc, the peasant-girl, Charles VII. was no King until he wascrowned; to her he was only the Dauphin; that is to say, the heir. If Ihave ever made her call him King, it was a mistake; she called him theDauphin, and nothing else until after the Coronation. It shows you as ina mirror--for Joan was a mirror in which the lowly hosts of France wereclearly reflected--that to all that vast underlying force called "thepeople," he was no King but only Dauphin before his crowning, and wasindisputably and irrevocably King after it.
Now you understand what a colossal move on the political chess-board theCoronation was. Bedford realized this by and by, and tried to patch uphis mistake by crowning his King; but what good could that do? None inthe world.
Speaking of chess, Joan's great acts may be likened to that game. Eachmove was made in its proper order, and it as great and effective becauseit was made in its proper order and not out of it. Each, at the timemade, seemed the greatest move; but the final result made them allrecognizable as equally essential and equally important. This is thegame, as played:
1. Joan moves to Orleans and Patay--check.
2. Then moves the Reconciliation--but does not proclaim check, it being amove for position, and to take effect later.
3. Next she moves the Coronation--check.
4. Next, the Bloodless March--check.
5. Final move (after her death), the reconciled Constable Richemont tothe French King's elbow--checkmate.
