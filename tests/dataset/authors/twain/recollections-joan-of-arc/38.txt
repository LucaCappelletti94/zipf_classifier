The Red Field of Patay
WHEN THE morning broke at last on that forever memorable 18th of June,thee was no enemy discoverable anywhere, as I have said. But that did nottrouble me. I knew we should find him, and that we should strike him;strike him the promised blow--the one from which the English power inFrance would not rise up in a thousand years, as Joan had said in hertrance.
The enemy had plunged into the wide plains of La Beauce--a roadless wastecovered with bushes, with here and there bodies of forest trees--a regionwhere an army would be hidden from view in a very little while. We foundthe trail in the soft wet earth and followed it. It indicated an orderlymarch; no confusion, no panic.
But we had to be cautious. In such a piece of country we could walk intoan ambush without any trouble. Therefore Joan sent bodies of cavalryahead under La Hire, Pothon, and other captains, to feel the way. Some ofthe other officers began to show uneasiness; this sort ofhide-and-go-seek business troubled them and made their confidence alittle shaky. Joan divined their state of mind and cried out impetuously:
"Name of God, what would you? We must smite these English, and we will.They shall not escape us. Though they were hung to the clouds we wouldget them!"
By and by we were nearing Patay; it was about a league away. Now at thistime our reconnaissance, feeling its way in the bush, frightened a deer,and it went bounding away and was out of sight in a moment. Then hardly aminute later a dull great shout went up in the distance toward Patay. Itwas the English soldiery. They had been shut up in a garrison so long onmoldy food that they could not keep their delight to themselves when thisfine fresh meat came springing into their midst. Poor creature, it hadwrought damage to a nation which loved it well. For the French knew wherethe English were now, whereas the English had no suspicion of where theFrench were.
La Hire halted where he was, and sent back the tidings. Joan was radiantwith joy. The Duke d'Alencon said to her:
"Very well, we have found them; shall we fight them?"
"Have you good spurs, prince?"
"Why? Will they make us run away?"
"Nenni, en nom de Dieu! These English are ours--they are lost. They willfly. Who overtakes them will need good spurs. Forward--close up!"
By the time we had come up with La Hire the English had discovered ourpresence. Talbot's force was marching in three bodies. First hisadvance-guard; then his artillery; then his battle-corps a good way inthe rear. He was now out of the bush and in a fair open country. He atonce posted his artillery, his advance-guard, and five hundred pickedarchers along some hedges where the French would be obliged to pass, andhoped to hold this position till his battle-corps could come up. Sir JohnFastolfe urged the battle-corps into a gallop. Joan saw her opportunityand ordered La Hire to advance--which La Hire promptly did, launching hiswild riders like a storm-wind, his customary fashion.
The duke and the Bastard wanted to follow, but Joan said:
"Not yet--wait."
So they waited--impatiently, and fidgeting in their saddles. But she wasready--gazing straight before her, measuring, weighing, calculating--byshades, minutes, fractions of minutes, seconds--with all her great soulpresent, in eye, and set of head, and noble pose of body--but patient,steady, master of herself--master of herself and of the situation.
And yonder, receding, receding, plumes lifting and falling, lifting andfalling, streamed the thundering charge of La Hire's godless crew, LaHire's great figure dominating it and his sword stretched aloft like aflagstaff.
"Oh, Satan and his Hellions, see them go!" Somebody muttered it in deepadmiration.
And now he was closing up--closing up on Fastolfe's rushing corps.
And now he struck it--struck it hard, and broke its order. It lifted theduke and the Bastard in their saddles to see it; and they turned,trembling with excitement, to Joan, saying:
"Now!"
But she put up her hand, still gazing, weighing, calculating, and saidagain:
"Wait--not yet."
Fastolfe's hard-driven battle-corps raged on like an avalanche toward thewaiting advance-guard. Suddenly these conceived the idea that it wasflying in panic before Joan; and so in that instant it broke and swarmedaway in a mad panic itself, with Talbot storming and cursing after it.
Now was the golden time. Joan drove her spurs home and waved the advancewith her sword. "Follow me!" she cried, and bent her head to her horse'sneck and sped away like the wind!
We went down into the confusion of that flying rout, and for three longhours we cut and hacked and stabbed. At last the bugles sang "Halt!"
The Battle of Patay was won.
Joan of Arc dismounted, and stood surveying that awful field, lost inthought. Presently she said:
"The praise is to God. He has smitten with a heavy hand this day." Aftera little she lifted her face, and looking afar off, said, with the mannerof one who is thinking aloud, "In a thousand years--a thousand years--theEnglish power in France will not rise up from this blow." She stood againa time thinking, then she turned toward her grouped generals, and therewas a glory in her face and a noble light in her eye; and she said:
"Oh, friends, friends, do you know?--do you comprehend? France is on theway to be free!"
"And had never been, but for Joan of Arc!" said La Hire, passing beforeher and bowing low, the other following and doing likewise; he mutteringas he went, "I will say it though I be damned for it." Then battalionafter battalion of our victorious army swung by, wildly cheering. Andthey shouted, "Live forever, Maid of Orleans, live forever!" while Joan,smiling, stood at the salute with her sword.
This was not the last time I saw the Maid of Orleans on the red field ofPatay. Toward the end of the day I came upon her where the dead and dyinglay stretched all about in heaps and winrows; our men had mortallywounded an English prisoner who was too poor to pay a ransom, and from adistance she had seen that cruel thing done; and had galloped to theplace and sent for a priest, and now she was holding the head of herdying enemy in her lap, and easing him to his death with comforting softwords, just as his sister might have done; and the womanly tears runningdown her face all the time.

It was a part ofthe testimony of the author of these "Personal Recollections of Joan ofArc," given by him in the Rehabilitation proceedings of 1456.--TRANSLATOR.
