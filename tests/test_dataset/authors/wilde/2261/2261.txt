To outer senses there is peace,A dreamy peace on either handDeep silence in the shadowy land,Deep silence where the shadows cease.
Save for a cry that echoes shrillFrom some lone bird disconsolate;A corncrake calling to its mate;The answer from the misty hill.
And suddenly the moon withdrawsHer sickle from the lightening skies,And to her sombre cavern flies,Wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze.
