  Reject me not if I should say to you	I do forget the sounding of your voice,	I do forget your eyes that searching through	The mists perceive our marriage, and rejoice.	 Yet, when the apple-blossom opens wide Under the pallid moonlight's fingering,	I see your blanched face at my breast, and hide	My eyes from diligent work, malingering.	 Ah, then, upon my bedroom I do draw	The blind to hide the garden, where the moon Enjoys the open blossoms as they straw	Their beauty for his taking, boon for boon.	 And I do lift my aching arms to you,	And I do lift my anguished, avid breast,	And I do weep for very pain of you, And fling myself at the doors of sleep, for rest.	 And I do toss through the troubled night for you,	Dreaming your yielded mouth is given to mine,	Feeling your strong breast carry me on into	The peace where sleep is stronger even than wine.
