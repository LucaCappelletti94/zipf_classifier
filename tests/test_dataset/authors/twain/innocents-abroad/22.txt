This Venice, which was a haughty, invincible, magnificent Republic fornearly fourteen hundred years; whose armies compelled the world'sapplause whenever and wherever they battled; whose navies well nigh helddominion of the seas, and whose merchant fleets whitened the remotestoceans with their sails and loaded these piers with the products of everyclime, is fallen a prey to poverty, neglect and melancholy decay. Sixhundred years ago, Venice was the Autocrat of Commerce; her mart was thegreat commercial centre, the distributing-house from whence the enormoustrade of the Orient was spread abroad over the Western world. To-day herpiers are deserted, her warehouses are empty, her merchant fleets arevanished, her armies and her navies are but memories. Her glory isdeparted, and with her crumbling grandeur of wharves and palaces abouther she sits among her stagnant lagoons, forlorn and beggared, forgottenof the world. She that in her palmy days commanded the commerce of ahemisphere and made the weal or woe of nations with a beck of herpuissant finger, is become the humblest among the peoples of the earth,--a peddler of glass beads for women, and trifling toys and trinkets forschool-girls and children.
The venerable Mother of the Republics is scarce a fit subject forflippant speech or the idle gossipping of tourists. It seems a sort ofsacrilege to disturb the glamour of old romance that pictures her to ussoftly from afar off as through a tinted mist, and curtains her ruin andher desolation from our view. One ought, indeed, to turn away from herrags, her poverty and her humiliation, and think of her only as she waswhen she sunk the fleets of Charlemagne; when she humbled FrederickBarbarossa or waved her victorious banners above the battlements ofConstantinople.
We reached Venice at eight in the evening, and entered a hearse belongingto the Grand Hotel d'Europe. At any rate, it was more like a hearse thanany thing else, though to speak by the card, it was a gondola. And thiswas the storied gondola of Venice!--the fairy boat in which the princelycavaliers of the olden time were wont to cleave the waters of the moonlitcanals and look the eloquence of love into the soft eyes of patricianbeauties, while the gay gondolier in silken doublet touched his guitarand sang as only gondoliers can sing! This the famed gondola and thisthe gorgeous gondolier!--the one an inky, rusty old canoe with a sablehearse-body clapped on to the middle of it, and the other a mangy,barefooted guttersnipe with a portion of his raiment on exhibition whichshould have been sacred from public scrutiny. Presently, as he turned acorner and shot his hearse into a dismal ditch between two long rows oftowering, untenanted buildings, the gay gondolier began to sing, true tothe traditions of his race. I stood it a little while. Then I said:
"Now, here, Roderigo Gonzales Michael Angelo, I'm a pilgrim, and I'm astranger, but I am not going to have my feelings lacerated by any suchcaterwauling as that. If that goes on, one of us has got to take water.It is enough that my cherished dreams of Venice have been blightedforever as to the romantic gondola and the gorgeous gondolier; thissystem of destruction shall go no farther; I will accept the hearse,under protest, and you may fly your flag of truce in peace, but here Iregister a dark and bloody oath that you shan't sing. Another yelp, andoverboard you go."
I began to feel that the old Venice of song and story had departedforever. But I was too hasty. In a few minutes we swept gracefully outinto the Grand Canal, and under the mellow moonlight the Venice of poetryand romance stood revealed. Right from the water's edge rose long linesof stately palaces of marble; gondolas were gliding swiftly hither andthither and disappearing suddenly through unsuspected gates and alleys;ponderous stone bridges threw their shadows athwart the glittering waves.There was life and motion everywhere, and yet everywhere there was ahush, a stealthy sort of stillness, that was suggestive of secretenterprises of bravoes and of lovers; and clad half in moonbeams and halfin mysterious shadows, the grim old mansions of the Republic seemed tohave an expression about them of having an eye out for just suchenterprises as these at that same moment. Music came floating over thewaters--Venice was complete.
It was a beautiful picture--very soft and dreamy and beautiful. But whatwas this Venice to compare with the Venice of midnight? Nothing. Therewas a fete--a grand fete in honor of some saint who had been instrumentalin checking the cholera three hundred years ago, and all Venice wasabroad on the water. It was no common affair, for the Venetians did notknow how soon they might need the saint's services again, now that thecholera was spreading every where. So in one vast space--say a third ofa mile wide and two miles long--were collected two thousand gondolas, andevery one of them had from two to ten, twenty and even thirty coloredlanterns suspended about it, and from four to a dozen occupants. Just asfar as the eye could reach, these painted lights were massed together--like a vast garden of many-colored flowers, except that these blossomswere never still; they were ceaselessly gliding in and out, and minglingtogether, and seducing you into bewildering attempts to follow their mazyevolutions. Here and there a strong red, green, or blue glare from arocket that was struggling to get away, splendidly illuminated all theboats around it. Every gondola that swam by us, with its crescents andpyramids and circles of colored lamps hung aloft, and lighting up thefaces of the young and the sweet-scented and lovely below, was a picture;and the reflections of those lights, so long, so slender, so numberless,so many-colored and so distorted and wrinkled by the waves, was a picturelikewise, and one that was enchantingly beautiful. Many and many a partyof young ladies and gentlemen had their state gondolas handsomelydecorated, and ate supper on board, bringing their swallow-tailed,white-cravatted varlets to wait upon them, and having their tablestricked out as if for a bridal supper. They had brought along thecostly globe lamps from their drawing-rooms, and the lace and silkencurtains from the same places, I suppose. And they had also broughtpianos and guitars, and they played and sang operas, while the plebeianpaper-lanterned gondolas from the suburbs and the back alleys crowdedaround to stare and listen.
There was music every where--choruses, string bands, brass bands, flutes,every thing. I was so surrounded, walled in, with music, magnificenceand loveliness, that I became inspired with the spirit of the scene, andsang one tune myself. However, when I observed that the other gondolashad sailed away, and my gondolier was preparing to go overboard, Istopped.
The fete was magnificent. They kept it up the whole night long, and Inever enjoyed myself better than I did while it lasted.
What a funny old city this Queen of the Adriatic is! Narrow streets,vast, gloomy marble palaces, black with the corroding damps of centuries,and all partly submerged; no dry land visible any where, and no sidewalksworth mentioning; if you want to go to church, to the theatre, or to therestaurant, you must call a gondola. It must be a paradise for cripples,for verily a man has no use for legs here.
For a day or two the place looked so like an overflowed Arkansas town,because of its currentless waters laving the very doorsteps of all thehouses, and the cluster of boats made fast under the windows, or skimmingin and out of the alleys and by-ways, that I could not get rid of theimpression that there was nothing the matter here but a spring freshet,and that the river would fall in a few weeks and leave a dirty high-watermark on the houses, and the streets full of mud and rubbish.
In the glare of day, there is little poetry about Venice, but under thecharitable moon her stained palaces are white again, their batteredsculptures are hidden in shadows, and the old city seems crowned oncemore with the grandeur that was hers five hundred years ago. It is easy,then, in fancy, to people these silent canals with plumed gallants andfair ladies--with Shylocks in gaberdine and sandals, venturing loans uponthe rich argosies of Venetian commerce--with Othellos and Desdemonas,with Iagos and Roderigos--with noble fleets and victorious legionsreturning from the wars. In the treacherous sunlight we see Venicedecayed, forlorn, poverty-stricken, and commerceless--forgotten andutterly insignificant. But in the moonlight, her fourteen centuries ofgreatness fling their glories about her, and once more is she theprinceliest among the nations of the earth.
 "There is a glorious city in the sea; The sea is in the broad, the narrow streets, Ebbing and flowing; and the salt-sea weed Clings to the marble of her palaces. No track of men, no footsteps to and fro, Lead to her gates! The path lies o'er the sea, Invisible: and from the land we went, As to a floating city--steering in, And gliding up her streets, as in a dream, So smoothly, silently--by many a dome, Mosque-like, and many a stately portico, The statues ranged along an azure sky; By many a pile, in more than Eastern pride, Of old the residence of merchant kings; The fronts of some, tho' time had shatter'd them, Still glowing with the richest hues of art, As tho' the wealth within them had run o'er."
What would one naturally wish to see first in Venice? The Bridge ofSighs, of course--and next the Church and the Great Square of St. Mark,the Bronze Horses, and the famous Lion of St. Mark.
We intended to go to the Bridge of Sighs, but happened into the DucalPalace first--a building which necessarily figures largely in Venetianpoetry and tradition. In the Senate Chamber of the ancient Republic wewearied our eyes with staring at acres of historical paintings byTintoretto and Paul Veronese, but nothing struck us forcibly except theone thing that strikes all strangers forcibly--a black square in themidst of a gallery of portraits. In one long row, around the great hall,were painted the portraits of the Doges of Venice (venerable fellows,with flowing white beards, for of the three hundred Senators eligible tothe office, the oldest was usually chosen Doge,) and each had itscomplimentary inscription attached--till you came to the place thatshould have had Marino Faliero's picture in it, and that was blank andblack--blank, except that it bore a terse inscription, saying that theconspirator had died for his crime. It seemed cruel to keep thatpitiless inscription still staring from the walls after the unhappywretch had been in his grave five hundred years.
At the head of the Giant's Staircase, where Marino Faliero was beheaded,and where the Doges were crowned in ancient times, two small slits in thestone wall were pointed out--two harmless, insignificant orifices thatwould never attract a stranger's attention--yet these were the terribleLions' Mouths! The heads were gone (knocked off by the French duringtheir occupation of Venice,) but these were the throats, down which wentthe anonymous accusation, thrust in secretly at dead of night by anenemy, that doomed many an innocent man to walk the Bridge of Sighs anddescend into the dungeon which none entered and hoped to see the sunagain. This was in the old days when the Patricians alone governedVenice--the common herd had no vote and no voice. There were onethousand five hundred Patricians; from these, three hundred Senators werechosen; from the Senators a Doge and a Council of Ten were selected, andby secret ballot the Ten chose from their own number a Council of Three.All these were Government spies, then, and every spy was undersurveillance himself--men spoke in whispers in Venice, and no man trustedhis neighbor--not always his own brother. No man knew who the Council ofThree were--not even the Senate, not even the Doge; the members of thatdread tribunal met at night in a chamber to themselves, masked, and robedfrom head to foot in scarlet cloaks, and did not even know each other,unless by voice. It was their duty to judge heinous political crimes,and from their sentence there was no appeal. A nod to the executionerwas sufficient. The doomed man was marched down a hall and out at adoor-way into the covered Bridge of Sighs, through it and into thedungeon and unto his death. At no time in his transit was he visible toany save his conductor. If a man had an enemy in those old days, thecleverest thing he could do was to slip a note for the Council of Threeinto the Lion's mouth, saying "This man is plotting against theGovernment." If the awful Three found no proof, ten to one they woulddrown him anyhow, because he was a deep rascal, since his plots wereunsolvable. Masked judges and masked executioners, with unlimited power,and no appeal from their judgements, in that hard, cruel age, were notlikely to be lenient with men they suspected yet could not convict.
We walked through the hall of the Council of Ten, and presently enteredthe infernal den of the Council of Three.
The table around which they had sat was there still, and likewise thestations where the masked inquisitors and executioners formerly stood,frozen, upright and silent, till they received a bloody order, and then,without a word, moved off like the inexorable machines they were, tocarry it out. The frescoes on the walls were startlingly suited to theplace. In all the other saloons, the halls, the great state chambers ofthe palace, the walls and ceilings were bright with gilding, rich withelaborate carving, and resplendent with gallant pictures of Venetianvictories in war, and Venetian display in foreign courts, and hallowedwith portraits of the Virgin, the Saviour of men, and the holy saintsthat preached the Gospel of Peace upon earth--but here, in dismalcontrast, were none but pictures of death and dreadful suffering!--not aliving figure but was writhing in torture, not a dead one but was smearedwith blood, gashed with wounds, and distorted with the agonies that hadtaken away its life!
From the palace to the gloomy prison is but a step--one might almost jumpacross the narrow canal that intervenes. The ponderous stone Bridge ofSighs crosses it at the second story--a bridge that is a covered tunnel--you can not be seen when you walk in it. It is partitioned lengthwise,and through one compartment walked such as bore light sentences inancient times, and through the other marched sadly the wretches whom theThree had doomed to lingering misery and utter oblivion in the dungeons,or to sudden and mysterious death. Down below the level of the water, bythe light of smoking torches, we were shown the damp, thick-walled cellswhere many a proud patrician's life was eaten away by the long-drawnmiseries of solitary imprisonment--without light, air, books; naked,unshaven, uncombed, covered with vermin; his useless tongue forgettingits office, with none to speak to; the days and nights of his life nolonger marked, but merged into one eternal eventless night; far away fromall cheerful sounds, buried in the silence of a tomb; forgotten by hishelpless friends, and his fate a dark mystery to them forever; losing hisown memory at last, and knowing no more who he was or how he came there;devouring the loaf of bread and drinking the water that were thrust intothe cell by unseen hands, and troubling his worn spirit no more withhopes and fears and doubts and longings to be free; ceasing to scratchvain prayers and complainings on walls where none, not even himself,could see them, and resigning himself to hopeless apathy, drivelingchildishness, lunacy! Many and many a sorrowful story like this thesestony walls could tell if they could but speak.
In a little narrow corridor, near by, they showed us where many aprisoner, after lying in the dungeons until he was forgotten by all savehis persecutors, was brought by masked executioners and garroted, orsewed up in a sack, passed through a little window to a boat, at dead ofnight, and taken to some remote spot and drowned.
They used to show to visitors the implements of torture wherewith theThree were wont to worm secrets out of the accused--villainous machinesfor crushing thumbs; the stocks where a prisoner sat immovable whilewater fell drop by drop upon his head till the torture was more thanhumanity could bear; and a devilish contrivance of steel, which incloseda prisoner's head like a shell, and crushed it slowly by means of ascrew. It bore the stains of blood that had trickled through its jointslong ago, and on one side it had a projection whereon the torturer restedhis elbow comfortably and bent down his ear to catch the moanings of thesufferer perishing within.
Of course we went to see the venerable relic of the ancient glory ofVenice, with its pavements worn and broken by the passing feet of athousand years of plebeians and patricians--The Cathedral of St. Mark.It is built entirely of precious marbles, brought from the Orient--nothing in its composition is domestic. Its hoary traditions make it anobject of absorbing interest to even the most careless stranger, and thusfar it had interest for me; but no further. I could not go intoecstasies over its coarse mosaics, its unlovely Byzantine architecture,or its five hundred curious interior columns from as many distantquarries. Every thing was worn out--every block of stone was smooth andalmost shapeless with the polishing hands and shoulders of loungers whodevoutly idled here in by-gone centuries and have died and gone to thedev--no, simply died, I mean.
Under the altar repose the ashes of St. Mark--and Matthew, Luke and John,too, for all I know. Venice reveres those relics above all thingsearthly. For fourteen hundred years St. Mark has been her patron saint.Every thing about the city seems to be named after him or so named as torefer to him in some way--so named, or some purchase rigged in some wayto scrape a sort of hurrahing acquaintance with him. That seems to bethe idea. To be on good terms with St. Mark, seems to be the very summitof Venetian ambition. They say St. Mark had a tame lion, and used totravel with him--and every where that St. Mark went, the lion was sure togo. It was his protector, his friend, his librarian. And so the WingedLion of St. Mark, with the open Bible under his paw, is a favorite emblemin the grand old city. It casts its shadow from the most ancient pillarin Venice, in the Grand Square of St. Mark, upon the throngs of freecitizens below, and has so done for many a long century. The winged lionis found every where--and doubtless here, where the winged lion is, noharm can come.
St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was martyred, I think.However, that has nothing to do with my legend. About the founding ofthe city of Venice--say four hundred and fifty years after Christ--(forVenice is much younger than any other Italian city,) a priest dreamedthat an angel told him that until the remains of St. Mark were brought toVenice, the city could never rise to high distinction among the nations;that the body must be captured, brought to the city, and a magnificentchurch built over it; and that if ever the Venetians allowed the Saint tobe removed from his new resting-place, in that day Venice would perishfrom off the face of the earth. The priest proclaimed his dream, andforthwith Venice set about procuring the corpse of St. Mark. Oneexpedition after another tried and failed, but the project was neverabandoned during four hundred years. At last it was secured bystratagem, in the year eight hundred and something. The commander of aVenetian expedition disguised himself, stole the bones, separated them,and packed them in vessels filled with lard. The religion of Mahometcauses its devotees to abhor anything that is in the nature of pork, andso when the Christian was stopped by the officers at the gates of thecity, they only glanced once into his precious baskets, then turned uptheir noses at the unholy lard, and let him go. The bones were buried inthe vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years toreceive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice weresecured. And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that ifthose holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would vanish like adream, and its foundations be buried forever in the unremembering sea.
