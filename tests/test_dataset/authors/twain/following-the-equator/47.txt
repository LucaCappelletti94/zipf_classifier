Simple rules for saving money: To save half, when you are fired by aneager impulse to contribute to a charity, wait, and count forty. To savethree-quarters, count sixty. To save it all, count sixty-five. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

The Thug said:
"How many of you English are passionately devoted to sporting!  Your daysand months are passed in its excitement.  A tiger, a panther, a buffaloor a hog rouses your utmost energies for its destruction--you even riskyour lives in its pursuit.  How much higher game is a Thug's!"
That must really be the secret of the rise and development of Thuggee.The joy of killing! the joy of seeing killing done--these are traits ofthe human race at large.  We white people are merely modified Thugs;Thugs fretting under the restraints of a not very thick skin ofcivilization; Thugs who long ago enjoyed the slaughter of the Romanarena, and later the burning of doubtful Christians by authenticChristians in the public squares, and who now, with the Thugs of Spainand Nimes, flock to enjoy the blood and misery of the bullring.  We haveno tourists of either sex or any religion who are able to resist thedelights of the bull-ring when opportunity offers; and we are gentleThugs in the hunting-season, and love to chase a tame rabbit and kill it.Still, we have made some progress-microscopic, and in truth scarcelyworth mentioning, and certainly nothing to be proud of--still, it isprogress: we no longer take pleasure in slaughtering or burning helplessmen.  We have reached a little altitude where we may look down upon theIndian Thugs with a complacent shudder; and we may even hope for a day,many centuries hence, when our posterity will look down upon us in thesame way.
There are many indications that the Thug often hunted men for the meresport of it; that the fright and pain of the quarry were no more to himthan are the fright and pain of the rabbit or the stag to us; and that hewas no more ashamed of beguiling his game with deceits and abusing itstrust than are we when we have imitated a wild animal's call and shot itwhen it honored us with its confidence and came to see what we wanted:
     "Madara, son of Nihal, and I, Ramzam, set out from Kotdee in the     cold weather and followed the high road for about twenty days in     search of travelers, until we came to Selempore, where we met a very     old man going to the east.  We won his confidence in this manner: he     carried a load which was too heavy for his old age; I said to him,     'You are an old man, I will aid you in carrying your load, as you     are from my part of the country.'  He said, 'Very well, take me with     you.'  So we took him with us to Selempore, where we slept that     night.  We woke him next morning before dawn and set out, and at the     distance of three miles we seated him to rest while it was still     very dark.  Madara was ready behind him, and strangled him.  He     never spoke a word.  He was about 60 or 70 years of age."
Another gang fell in with a couple of barbers and persuaded them to comealong in their company by promising them the job of shaving the wholecrew--30 Thugs.  At the place appointed for the murder 15 got shaved, andactually paid the barbers for their work.  Then killed them and took backthe money.
A gang of forty-two Thugs came across two Brahmins and a shopkeeper onthe road, beguiled them into a grove and got up a concert for theirentertainment.  While these poor fellows were listening to the music thestranglers were standing behind them; and at the proper moment fordramatic effect they applied the noose.
The most devoted fisherman must have a bite at least as often as oncea week or his passion will cool and he will put up his tackle.  Thetiger-sportsman must find a tiger at least once a fortnight or he will gettired and quit.  The elephant-hunter's enthusiasm will waste away littleby little, and his zeal will perish at last if he plod around a monthwithout finding a member of that noble family to assassinate.
But when the lust in the hunter's heart is for the noblest of allquarries, man, how different is the case! and how watery and poor is thezeal and how childish the endurance of those other hunters by comparison.Then, neither hunger, nor thirst, nor fatigue, nor deferred hope, normonotonous disappointment, nor leaden-footed lapse of time can conquerthe hunter's patience or weaken the joy of his quest or cool the splendidrage of his desire.  Of all the hunting-passions that burn in the breastof man, there is none that can lift him superior to discouragements likethese but the one--the royal sport, the supreme sport, whose quarry ishis brother.  By comparison, tiger-hunting is a colorless poor thing, forall it has been so bragged about.
Why, the Thug was content to tramp patiently along, afoot, in the wastingheat of India, week after week, at an average of nine or ten miles a day,if he might but hope to find game some time or other and refresh hislonging soul with blood.  Here is an instance:
     "I (Ramzam) and Hyder set out, for the purpose of strangling     travelers, from Guddapore, and proceeded via the Fort of Julalabad,     Newulgunge, Bangermow, on the banks of the Ganges (upwards of 100     miles), from whence we returned by another route.  Still no     travelers! till we reached Bowaneegunge, where we fell in with a     traveler, a boatman; we inveigled him and about two miles east of     there Hyder strangled him as he stood--for he was troubled and     afraid, and would not sit.  We then made a long journey (about 130     miles) and reached Hussunpore Bundwa, where at the tank we fell in     with a traveler--he slept there that night; next morning we followed     him and tried to win his confidence; at the distance of two miles we     endeavored to induce him to sit down--but he would not, having     become aware of us.  I attempted to strangle him as he walked along,     but did not succeed; both of us then fell upon him, he made a great     outcry, 'They are murdering me!' at length we strangled him and     flung his body into a well.  After this we returned to our homes,     having been out a month and traveled about 260 miles.  A total of     two men murdered on the expedition."
And here is another case-related by the terrible Futty Khan, a man with atremendous record, to be re-mentioned by and by:
     "I, with three others, traveled for about 45 days a distance of     about 200 miles in search of victims along the highway to Bundwa and     returned by Davodpore (another 200 miles) during which journey we     had only one murder, which happened in this manner.  Four miles to     the east of Noubustaghat we fell in with a traveler, an old man.  I,     with Koshal and Hyder, inveigled him and accompanied him that day     within 3 miles of Rampoor, where, after dark, in a lonely place, we     got him to sit down and rest; and while I kept him in talk, seated     before him, Hyder behind strangled him: he made no resistance.     Koshal stabbed him under the arms and in the throat, and we flung     the body into a running stream.  We got about 4 or 5 rupees each ($2     or $2.50).  We then proceeded homewards.  A total of one man     murdered on this expedition."
There.  They tramped 400 miles, were gone about three months, andharvested two dollars and a half apiece.  But the mere pleasure of thehunt was sufficient.  That was pay enough.  They did no grumbling.
Every now and then in this big book one comes across that patheticremark: "we tried to get him to sit down but he would not."  It tells thewhole story.  Some accident had awakened the suspicion in him that thesesmooth friends who had been petting and coddling him and making him feelso safe and so fortunate after his forlorn and lonely wanderings were thedreaded Thugs; and now their ghastly invitation to "sit and rest" hadconfirmed its truth.  He knew there was no help for him, and that he waslooking his last upon earthly things, but "he would not sit."  No, notthat--it was too awful to think of!
There are a number of instances which indicate that when a man had oncetasted the regal joys of man-hunting he could not be content with thedull monotony of a crimeless life after ward.  Example, from a Thug'stestimony:
     "We passed through to Kurnaul, where we found a former Thug named     Junooa, an old comrade of ours, who had turned religious mendicant     and become a disciple and holy.  He came to us in the serai and     weeping with joy returned to his old trade."
Neither wealth nor honors nor dignities could satisfy a reformed Thug forlong.  He would throw them all away, someday, and go back to the luridpleasures of hunting men, and being hunted himself by the British.
Ramzam was taken into a great native grandee's service and givenauthority over five villages.  "My authority extended over these peopleto summons them to my presence, to make them stand or sit.  I dressedwell, rode my pony, and had two sepoys, a scribe and a village guard toattend me.  During three years I used to pay each village a monthlyvisit, and no one suspected that I was a Thug!  The chief man used towait on me to transact business, and as I passed along, old and youngmade their salaam to me."
And yet during that very three years he got leave of absence "to attend awedding," and instead went off on a Thugging lark with six other Thugsand hunted the highway for fifteen days!--with satisfactory results.
Afterwards he held a great office under a Rajah.  There he had ten milesof country under his command and a military guard of fifteen men, withauthority to call out 2,000 more upon occasion.  But the British got onhis track, and they crowded him so that he had to give himself up.  Seewhat a figure he was when he was gotten up for style and had all histhings on: "I was fully armed--a sword, shield, pistols, a matchlockmusket and a flint gun, for I was fond of being thus arrayed, and when soarmed feared not though forty men stood before me."
He gave himself up and proudly proclaimed himself a Thug.  Then byrequest he agreed to betray his friend and pal, Buhram, a Thug with themost tremendous record in India.  "I went to the house where Buhram slept(often has he led our gangs!) I woke him, he knew me well, and cameoutside to me.  It was a cold night, so under pretence of warming myself,but in reality to have light for his seizure by the guards, I lightedsome straw and made a blaze.  We were warming our hands.  The guards drewaround us.  I said to them, 'This is Buhram,' and he was seized just as acat seizes a mouse.  Then Buhram said, 'I am a Thug! my father was aThug, my grandfather was a Thug, and I have thugged with many!'"
So spoke the mighty hunter, the mightiest of the mighty, the GordonCumming of his day.  Not much regret noticeable in it.--["Having planteda bullet in the shoulder-bone of an elephant, and caused the agonizedcreature to lean for support against a tree, I proceeded to brew somecoffee.  Having refreshed myself, taking observations of the elephant'sspasms and writhings between the sips, I resolved to make experiments onvulnerable points, and, approaching very near, I fired several bullets atdifferent parts of his enormous skull.  He only acknowledged the shots bya salaam-like movement of his trunk, with the point of which he gentlytouched the wounds with a striking and peculiar action.  Surprised andshocked to find that I was only prolonging the suffering of the noblebeast, which bore its trials with such dignified composure, I resolved tofinish the proceeding with all possible despatch, and accordingly openedfire upon him from the left side.  Aiming at the shoulder, I fired sixshots with the two-grooved rifle, which must have eventually provedmortal, after which I fired six shots at the same part with the Dutchsix-founder.  Large tears now trickled down from his eyes, which heslowly shut and opened, his colossal frame shivered convulsively, andfalling on his side he expired."--Gordon Cumming.]
So many many times this Official Report leaves one's curiosityunsatisfied.  For instance, here is a little paragraph out of the recordof a certain band of 193 Thugs, which has that defect:
     "Fell in with Lall Sing Subahdar and his family, consisting of nine     persons.  Traveled with them two days, and the third put them all to     death except the two children, little boys of one and a half years     old."
There it stops.  What did they do with those poor little fellows?  Whatwas their subsequent history?  Did they purpose training them up asThugs?  How could they take care of such little creatures on a marchwhich stretched over several months?  No one seems to have cared to askany questions about the babies.  But I do wish I knew.
One would be apt to imagine that the Thugs were utterly callous, utterlydestitute of human feelings, heartless toward their own families as wellas toward other people's; but this was not so.  Like all other Indians,they had a passionate love for their kin.  A shrewd British officer whoknew the Indian character, took that characteristic into account inlaying his plans for the capture of Eugene Sue's famous Feringhea.  Hefound out Feringhea's hiding-place, and sent a guard by night to seizehim, but the squad was awkward and he got away.  However, they got therest of the family--the mother, wife, child, and brother--and broughtthem to the officer, at Jubbulpore; the officer did not fret, but bidedhis time: "I knew Feringhea would not go far while links so dear to himwere in my hands."  He was right.  Feringhea knew all the danger he wasrunning by staying in the neighborhood, still he could not tear himselfaway.  The officer found that he divided his time between five villageswhere he had relatives and friends who could get news for him from hisfamily in Jubbulpore jail; and that he never slept two consecutive nightsin the same village.  The officer traced out his several haunts, thenpounced upon all the five villages on the one night and at the same hour,and got his man.
Another example of family affection.  A little while previously to thecapture of Feringhea's family, the British officer had capturedFeringhea's foster-brother, leader of a gang of ten, and had tried theeleven and condemned them to be hanged.  Feringhea's captured familyarrived at the jail the day before the execution was to take place.  Thefoster-brother, Jhurhoo, entreated to be allowed to see the aged motherand the others.  The prayer was granted, and this is what took place--itis the British officer who speaks:
     "In the morning, just before going to the scaffold, the interview     took place before me.  He fell at the old woman's feet and begged     that she would relieve him from the obligations of the milk with     which she had nourished him from infancy, as he was about to die     before he could fulfill any of them.  She placed her hands on his     head, and he knelt, and she said she forgave him all, and bid him     die like a man."
If a capable artist should make a picture of it, it would be full ofdignity and solemnity and pathos; and it could touch you.  You wouldimagine it to be anything but what it was.  There is reverence there, andtenderness, and gratefulness, and compassion, and resignation, andfortitude, and self-respect--and no sense of disgrace, no thought ofdishonor.  Everything is there that goes to make a noble parting, andgive it a moving grace and beauty and dignity.  And yet one of thesepeople is a Thug and the other a mother of Thugs!  The incongruities ofour human nature seem to reach their limit here.
I wish to make note of one curious thing while I think of it.  One of thevery commonest remarks to be found in this bewildering array of Thugconfessions is this:
"Strangled him and threw him an a well!"  In one case they threw sixteeninto a well--and they had thrown others in the same well before.  Itmakes a body thirsty to read about it.
And there is another very curious thing.  The bands of Thugs had privategraveyards.  They did not like to kill and bury at random, here and thereand everywhere.  They preferred to wait, and toll the victims along, andget to one of their regular burying-places ('bheels') if they could.  Inthe little kingdom of Oude, which was about half as big as Ireland andabout as big as the State of Maine, they had two hundred and seventy-four'bheels'.  They were scattered along fourteen hundred miles of road, atan average of only five miles apart, and the British government tracedout and located each and every one of them and set them down on the map.
The Oude bands seldom went out of their own country, but they did athriving business within its borders.  So did outside bands who came inand helped.  Some of the Thug leaders of Oude were noted for theirsuccessful careers.  Each of four of them confessed to above 300 murders;another to nearly 400; our friend Ramzam to 604--he is the one who gotleave of absence to attend a wedding and went thugging instead; and he isalso the one who betrayed Buhram to the British.
But the biggest records of all were the murder-lists of Futty Khan andBuhram.  Futty Khan's number is smaller than Ramzam's, but he is placedat the head because his average is the best in Oude-Thug history per yearof service.  His slaughter was 508 men in twenty years, and he was stilla young man when the British stopped his industry.  Buhram's list was 931murders, but it took him forty years.  His average was one man and nearlyall of another man per month for forty years, but Futty Khan's averagewas two men and a little of another man per month during his twenty yearsof usefulness.
There is one very striking thing which I wish to call attention to.  Youhave surmised from the listed callings followed by the victims of theThugs that nobody could travel the Indian roads unprotected and live toget through; that the Thugs respected no quality, no vocation, noreligion, nobody; that they killed every unarmed man that came in theirway.  That is wholly true--with one reservation.  In all the long file ofThug confessions an English traveler is mentioned but once--and this iswhat the Thug says of the circumstance:
     "He was on his way from Mhow to Bombay.  We studiously avoided him.     He proceeded next morning with a number of travelers who had sought     his protection, and they took the road to Baroda."
We do not know who he was; he flits across the page of this rusty oldbook and disappears in the obscurity beyond; but he is an impressivefigure, moving through that valley of death serene and unafraid, clothedin the might of the English name.
We have now followed the big official book through, and we understandwhat Thuggee was, what a bloody terror it was, what a desolating scourgeit was.  In 1830 the English found this cancerous organization imbeddedin the vitals of the empire, doing its devastating work in secrecy, andassisted, protected, sheltered, and hidden by innumerable confederates--big and little native chiefs, customs officers, village officials, andnative police, all ready to lie for it, and the mass of the people,through fear, persistently pretending to know nothing about its doings;and this condition of things had existed for generations, and wasformidable with the sanctions of age and old custom.  If ever there wasan unpromising task, if ever there was a hopeless task in the world,surely it was offered here--the task of conquering Thuggee.  But thatlittle handful of English officials in India set their sturdy andconfident grip upon it, and ripped it out, root and branch!  How modestdo Captain Vallancey's words sound now, when we read them again, knowingwhat we know:
     "The day that sees this far-spread evil completely eradicated from     India, and known only in name, will greatly tend to immortalize     British rule in the East."
It would be hard to word a claim more modestly than that for this mostnoble work.
