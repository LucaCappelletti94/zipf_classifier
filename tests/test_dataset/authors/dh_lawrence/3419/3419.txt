  The acrid scents of autumn,	Reminiscent of slinking beasts, make me fear	Everything, tear-trembling stars of autumn	And the snore of the night in my ear.	 For suddenly, flush-fallen, All my life, in a rush	Of shedding away, has left me	Naked, exposed on the bush.	 I, on the bush of the globe,	Like a newly-naked berry, shrink Disclosed: but I also am prowling	As well in the scents that slink	 Abroad: I in this naked berry	Of flesh that stands dismayed on the bush;	And I in the stealthy, brindled odours Prowling about the lush	 And acrid night of autumn;	My soul, along with the rout,	Rank and treacherous, prowling,	Disseminated out.  For the night, with a great breath intaken,	Has taken my spirit outside	Me, till I reel with disseminated consciousness,	Like a man who has died.	 At the same time I stand exposed Here on the bush of the globe,	A newly-naked berry of flesh	For the stars to probe.
