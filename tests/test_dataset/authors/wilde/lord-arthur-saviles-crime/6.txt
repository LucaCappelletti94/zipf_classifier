When the wedding took place, some three weeks later, St. Peter's wascrowded with a perfect mob of smart people. The service was read inthe most impressive manner by the Dean of Chichester, and everybodyagreed that they had never seen a handsomer couple than the brideand bridegroom. They were more than handsome, however--they werehappy. Never for a single moment did Lord Arthur regret all that hehad suffered for Sybil's sake, while she, on her side, gave him thebest things a woman can give to any man--worship, tenderness, andlove. For them romance was not killed by reality. They always feltyoung.
Some years afterwards, when two beautiful children had been born tothem, Lady Windermere came down on a visit to Alton Priory, a lovelyold place, that had been the Duke's wedding present to his son; andone afternoon as she was sitting with Lady Arthur under a lime-treein the garden, watching the little boy and girl as they played upand down the rose-walk, like fitful sunbeams, she suddenly took herhostess's hand in hers, and said, 'Are you happy, Sybil?'
'Dear Lady Windermere, of course I am happy. Aren't you?'
'I have no time to be happy, Sybil. I always like the last personwho is introduced to me; but, as a rule, as soon as I know people Iget tired of them.'
'Don't your lions satisfy you, Lady Windermere?'
'Oh dear, no! lions are only good for one season. As soon as theirmanes are cut, they are the dullest creatures going. Besides, theybehave very badly, if you are really nice to them. Do you rememberthat horrid Mr. Podgers? He was a dreadful impostor. Of course, Ididn't mind that at all, and even when he wanted to borrow money Iforgave him, but I could not stand his making love to me. He hasreally made me hate cheiromancy. I go in for telepathy now. It ismuch more amusing.'
'You mustn't say anything against cheiromancy here, Lady Windermere;it is the only subject that Arthur does not like people to chaffabout. I assure you he is quite serious over it.'
'You don't mean to say that he believes in it, Sybil?'
'Ask him, Lady Windermere, here he is'; and Lord Arthur came up thegarden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand, and his twochildren dancing round him.
'Lord Arthur?'
'Yes, Lady Windermere.'
'You don't mean to say that you believe in cheiromancy?'
'Of course I do,' said the young man, smiling.
'But why?'
'Because I owe to it all the happiness of my life,' he murmured,throwing himself into a wicker chair.
'My dear Lord Arthur, what do you owe to it?'
'Sybil,' he answered, handing his wife the roses, and looking intoher violet eyes.
'What nonsense!' cried Lady Windermere. 'I never heard suchnonsense in all my life.'
