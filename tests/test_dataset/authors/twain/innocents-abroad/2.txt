Occasionally, during the following month, I dropped in at 117 Wall Streetto inquire how the repairing and refurnishing of the vessel was comingon, how additions to the passenger list were averaging, how many peoplethe committee were decreeing not "select" every day and banishing insorrow and tribulation. I was glad to know that we were to have a littleprinting press on board and issue a daily newspaper of our own. I wasglad to learn that our piano, our parlor organ, and our melodeon were tobe the best instruments of the kind that could be had in the market. Iwas proud to observe that among our excursionists were three ministers ofthe gospel, eight doctors, sixteen or eighteen ladies, several militaryand naval chieftains with sounding titles, an ample crop of "Professors"of various kinds, and a gentleman who had "COMMISSIONER OF THE UNITEDSTATES OF AMERICA TO EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA" thundering after his namein one awful blast! I had carefully prepared myself to take rather aback seat in that ship because of the uncommonly select material thatwould alone be permitted to pass through the camel's eye of thatcommittee on credentials; I had schooled myself to expect an imposingarray of military and naval heroes and to have to set that back seatstill further back in consequence of it maybe; but I state frankly that Iwas all unprepared for this crusher.
I fell under that titular avalanche a torn and blighted thing. I saidthat if that potentate must go over in our ship, why, I supposed he must--but that to my thinking, when the United States considered it necessaryto send a dignitary of that tonnage across the ocean, it would be inbetter taste, and safer, to take him apart and cart him over in sectionsin several ships.
Ah, if I had only known then that he was only a common mortal, and thathis mission had nothing more overpowering about it than the collecting ofseeds and uncommon yams and extraordinary cabbages and peculiar bullfrogsfor that poor, useless, innocent, mildewed old fossil the SmithsonianInstitute, I would have felt so much relieved.
During that memorable month I basked in the happiness of being for oncein my life drifting with the tide of a great popular movement. Everybodywas going to Europe--I, too, was going to Europe. Everybody was going tothe famous Paris Exposition--I, too, was going to the Paris Exposition.The steamship lines were carrying Americans out of the various ports ofthe country at the rate of four or five thousand a week in the aggregate.If I met a dozen individuals during that month who were not going toEurope shortly, I have no distinct remembrance of it now. I walked aboutthe city a good deal with a young Mr. Blucher, who was booked for theexcursion. He was confiding, good-natured, unsophisticated,companionable; but he was not a man to set the river on fire. He had themost extraordinary notions about this European exodus and came at last toconsider the whole nation as packing up for emigration to France. Westepped into a store on Broadway one day, where he bought a handkerchief,and when the man could not make change, Mr. B. said:
"Never mind, I'll hand it to you in Paris."
"But I am not going to Paris."
"How is--what did I understand you to say?"
"I said I am not going to Paris."
"Not going to Paris! Not g---- well, then, where in the nation are yougoing to?"
"Nowhere at all."
"Not anywhere whatsoever?--not any place on earth but this?"
"Not any place at all but just this--stay here all summer."
My comrade took his purchase and walked out of the store without a word--walked out with an injured look upon his countenance. Up the streetapiece he broke silence and said impressively: "It was a lie--that is myopinion of it!"
In the fullness of time the ship was ready to receive her passengers.I was introduced to the young gentleman who was to be my roommate, andfound him to be intelligent, cheerful of spirit, unselfish, full ofgenerous impulses, patient, considerate, and wonderfully good-natured.Not any passenger that sailed in the Quaker City will withhold hisendorsement of what I have just said. We selected a stateroom forward ofthe wheel, on the starboard side, "below decks." It bad two berths init, a dismal dead-light, a sink with a washbowl in it, and a long,sumptuously cushioned locker, which was to do service as a sofa--partly--and partly as a hiding place for our things. Notwithstanding all thisfurniture, there was still room to turn around in, but not to swing a catin, at least with entire security to the cat. However, the room waslarge, for a ship's stateroom, and was in every way satisfactory.
The vessel was appointed to sail on a certain Saturday early in June.
A little after noon on that distinguished Saturday I reached the ship andwent on board. All was bustle and confusion. [I have seen that remarkbefore somewhere.] The pier was crowded with carriages and men;passengers were arriving and hurrying on board; the vessel's decks wereencumbered with trunks and valises; groups of excursionists, arrayed inunattractive traveling costumes, were moping about in a drizzling rainand looking as droopy and woebegone as so many molting chickens. Thegallant flag was up, but it was under the spell, too, and hung limp anddisheartened by the mast. Altogether, it was the bluest, bluestspectacle! It was a pleasure excursion--there was no gainsaying that,because the program said so--it was so nominated in the bond--but itsurely hadn't the general aspect of one.
Finally, above the banging, and rumbling, and shouting, and hissing ofsteam rang the order to "cast off!"--a sudden rush to the gangways--ascampering ashore of visitors-a revolution of the wheels, and we wereoff--the pic-nic was begun! Two very mild cheers went up from thedripping crowd on the pier; we answered them gently from the slipperydecks; the flag made an effort to wave, and failed; the "battery of guns"spake not--the ammunition was out.
We steamed down to the foot of the harbor and came to anchor. It wasstill raining. And not only raining, but storming. "Outside" we couldsee, ourselves, that there was a tremendous sea on. We must lie still,in the calm harbor, till the storm should abate. Our passengers hailedfrom fifteen states; only a few of them had ever been to sea before;manifestly it would not do to pit them against a full-blown tempest untilthey had got their sea-legs on. Toward evening the two steam tugs thathad accompanied us with a rollicking champagne-party of young New Yorkerson board who wished to bid farewell to one of our number in due andancient form departed, and we were alone on the deep. On deep fivefathoms, and anchored fast to the bottom. And out in the solemn rain, atthat. This was pleasuring with a vengeance.
It was an appropriate relief when the gong sounded for prayer meeting.The first Saturday night of any other pleasure excursion might have beendevoted to whist and dancing; but I submit it to the unprejudiced mind ifit would have been in good taste for us to engage in such frivolities,considering what we had gone through and the frame of mind we were in.We would have shone at a wake, but not at anything more festive.
However, there is always a cheering influence about the sea; and in myberth that night, rocked by the measured swell of the waves and lulled bythe murmur of the distant surf, I soon passed tranquilly out of allconsciousness of the dreary experiences of the day and damagingpremonitions of the future.
