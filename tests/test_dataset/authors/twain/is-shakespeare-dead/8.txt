Shakespeare as a Lawyer {2}
The Plays and Poems of Shakespeare supply ample evidence that theirauthor not only had a very extensive and accurate knowledge of law,but that he was well acquainted with the manners and customs ofmembers of the Inns of Court and with legal life generally.
"While novelists and dramatists are constantly making mistakes asto the laws of marriage, of wills, and inheritance, toShakespeare's law, lavishly as he expounds it, there can neither bedemurrer, nor bill of exceptions, nor writ of error." Such was thetestimony borne by one of the most distinguished lawyers of thenineteenth century who was raised to the high office of Lord ChiefJustice in 1850, and subsequently became Lord Chancellor. Itsweight will, doubtless, be more appreciated by lawyers than bylaymen, for only lawyers know how impossible it is for those whohave not served an apprenticeship to the law to avoid displayingtheir ignorance if they venture to employ legal terms and todiscuss legal doctrines. "There is nothing so dangerous," wroteLord Campbell, "as for one not of the craft to tamper with ourfreemasonry." A layman is certain to betray himself by using someexpression which a lawyer would never employ. Mr. Sidney Leehimself supplies us with an example of this. He writes (p. 164):"On February 15, 1609, Shakespeare . . . obtained judgment from ajury against Addenbroke for the payment of No. 6, and No. 1. 5s.0d. costs." Now a lawyer would never have spoken of obtaining"judgment from a jury," for it is the function of a jury not todeliver judgment (which is the prerogative of the court), but tofind a verdict on the facts. The error is, indeed, a venial one,but it is just one of those little things which at once enable alawyer to know if the writer is a layman or "one of the craft."
But when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal subjects, heis naturally apt to make an exhibition of his incompetence. "Let anon-professional man, however acute," writes Lord Campbell again,"presume to talk law, or to draw illustrations from legal sciencein discussing other subjects, and he will speedily fall intolaughable absurdity."
And what does the same high authority say about Shakespeare? Hehad "a deep technical knowledge of the law," and an easyfamiliarity with "some of the most abstruse proceedings in Englishjurisprudence." And again: "Whenever he indulges this propensityhe uniformly lays down good law." Of Henry IV., Part 2, he says:"If Lord Eldon could be supposed to have written the play, I do notsee how he could be chargeable with having forgotten any of his lawwhile writing it." Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke speak of "themarvelous intimacy which he displays with legal terms, his frequentadoption of them in illustration, and his curiously technicalknowledge of their form and force." Malone, himself a lawyer,wrote: "His knowledge of legal terms is not merely such as mightbe acquired by the casual observation of even his all-comprehendingmind; it has the appearance of technical skill." Another lawyerand well-known Shakespearean, Richard Grant White, says: "Nodramatist of the time, not even Beaumont, who was the younger sonof a judge of the Common Pleas, and who after studying in the Innsof Court abandoned law for the drama, used legal phrases withShakespeare's readiness and exactness. And the significance ofthis fact is heightened by another, that it is only to the languageof the law that he exhibits this inclination. The phrases peculiarto other occupations serve him on rare occasions by way ofdescription, comparison or illustration, generally when somethingin the scene suggests them, but legal phrases flow from his pen aspart of his vocabulary, and parcel of his thought. Take the word'purchase' for instance, which, in ordinary use, means to acquireby giving value, but applies in law to all legal modes of obtainingproperty except by inheritance or descent, and in this peculiarsense the word occurs five times in Shakespeare's thirty-fourplays, and only in one single instance in the fifty-four plays ofBeaumont and Fletcher. It has been suggested that it was inattendance upon the courts in London that he picked up his legalvocabulary. But this supposition not only fails to account forShakespeare's peculiar freedom and exactness in the use of thatphraseology, it does not even place him in the way of learningthose terms his use of which is most remarkable, which are not suchas he would have heard at ordinary proceedings at nisi prius, butsuch as refer to the tenure or transfer of real property, 'fine andrecovery,' 'statutes merchant,' 'purchase,' 'indenture,' 'tenure,''double voucher,' 'fee simple,' 'fee farm,' 'remainder,''reversion,' 'forfeiture,' etc. This conveyancer's jargon couldnot have been picked up by hanging round the courts of law inLondon two hundred and fifty years ago, when suits as to the titleof real property were comparatively rare. And beside, Shakespeareuses his law just as freely in his first plays, written in hisfirst London years, as in those produced at a later period. Justas exactly, too; for the correctness and propriety with which theseterms are introduced have compelled the admiration of a ChiefJustice and a Lord Chancellor."
Senator Davis wrote: "We seem to have something more than asciolist's temerity of indulgence in the terms of an unfamiliarart. No legal solecisms will be found. The abstrusest elements ofthe common law are impressed into a disciplined service. Over andover again, where such knowledge is unexampled in writers unlearnedin the law, Shakespeare appears in perfect possession of it. Inthe law of real property, its rules of tenure and descents, itsentails, its fines and recoveries, their vouchers and doublevouchers, in the procedure of the Courts, the method of bringingwrits and arrests, the nature of actions, the rules of pleading,the law of escapes and of contempt of court, in the principles ofevidence, both technical and philosophical, in the distinctionbetween the temporal and spiritual tribunals, in the law ofattainder and forfeiture, in the requisites of a valid marriage, inthe presumption of legitimacy, in the learning of the law ofprerogative, in the inalienable character of the Crown, thismastership appears with surprising authority."
To all this testimony (and there is much more which I have notcited) may now be added that of a great lawyer of our own times,viz.: Sir James Plaisted Wilde, Q.C. created a Baron of theExchequer in 1860, promoted to the post of Judge-Ordinary and Judgeof the Courts of Probate and Divorce in 1863, and better known tothe world as Lord Penzance, to which dignity he was raised in 1869.Lord Penzance, as all lawyers know, and as the late Mr. Inderwick,K.C., has testified, was one of the first legal authorities of hisday, famous for his "remarkable grasp of legal principles," and"endowed by nature with a remarkable facility for marshallingfacts, and for a clear expression of his views."
Lord Penzance speaks of Shakespeare's "perfect familiarity with notonly the principles, axioms, and maxims, but the technicalities ofEnglish law, a knowledge so perfect and intimate that he was neverincorrect and never at fault . . . The mode in which this knowledgewas pressed into service on all occasions to express his meaningand illustrate his thoughts, was quite unexampled. He seems tohave had a special pleasure in his complete and ready mastership ofit in all its branches. As manifested in the plays, this legalknowledge and learning had therefore a special character whichplaces it on a wholly different footing from the rest of themultifarious knowledge which is exhibited in page after page of theplays. At every turn and point at which the author required ametaphor, simile, or illustration, his mind ever turned FIRST tothe law. He seems almost to have THOUGHT in legal phrases, thecommonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of his pen indescription or illustration. That he should have descanted inlawyer language when he had a forensic subject in hand, such asShylock's bond, was to be expected, but the knowledge of law in'Shakespeare' was exhibited in a far different manner: itprotruded itself on all occasions, appropriate or inappropriate,and mingled itself with strains of thought widely divergent fromforensic subjects." Again: "To acquire a perfect familiarity withlegal principles, and an accurate and ready use of the technicalterms and phrases not only of the conveyancer's office but of thepleader's chambers and the Courts at Westminster, nothing short ofemployment in some career involving constant contact with legalquestions and general legal work would be requisite. But acontinuous employment involves the element of time, and time wasjust what the manager of two theatres had not at his disposal. Inwhat portion of Shakespeare's (i.e. Shakspere's) career would it bepossible to point out that time could be found for theinterposition of a legal employment in the chambers or offices ofpractising lawyers?"
Stratfordians, as is well known, casting about for some possibleexplanation of Shakespeare's extraordinary knowledge of law, havemade the suggestion that Shakespeare might, conceivably, have beena clerk in an attorney's office before he came to London. Mr.Collier wrote to Lord Campbell to ask his opinion as to theprobability of this being true. His answer was as follows: "Yourequire us to believe implicitly a fact, of which, if true,positive and irrefragable evidence in his own handwriting mighthave been forthcoming to establish it. Not having been actuallyenrolled as an attorney, neither the records of the local court atStratford nor of the superior Courts at Westminster would presenthis name as being concerned in any suit as an attorney, but itmight reasonably have been expected that there would be deeds orwills witnessed by him still extant, and after a very diligentsearch none such can be discovered."
Upon this Lord Penzance comments: "It cannot be doubted that LordCampbell was right in this. No young man could have been at workin an attorney's office without being called upon continually toact as a witness, and in many other ways leaving traces of his workand name." There is not a single fact or incident in all that isknown of Shakespeare, even by rumor or tradition, which supportsthis notion of a clerkship. And after much argument and surmisewhich has been indulged in on this subject, we may, I think, safelyput the notion on one side, for no less an authority than Mr. GrantWhite says finally that the idea of his having been clerk to anattorney has been "blown to pieces."
It is altogether characteristic of Mr. Churton Collins that he,nevertheless, adopts this exploded myth. "That Shakespeare was inearly life employed as a clerk in an attorney's office, may becorrect. At Stratford there was by royal charter a Court of Recordsitting every fortnight, with six attorneys, beside the town clerk,belonging to it, and it is certainly not straining probability tosuppose that the young Shakespeare may have had employment in oneof them. There is, it is true, no tradition to this effect, butsuch traditions as we have about Shakespeare's occupation betweenthe time of leaving school and going to London are so loose andbaseless that no confidence can be placed in them. It is, to saythe least, more probable that he was in an attorney's office thanthat he was a butcher killing calves 'in a high style,' and makingspeeches over them."
This is a charming specimen of Stratfordian argument. There is, aswe have seen, a very old tradition that Shakespeare was a butcher'sapprentice. John Dowdall, who made a tour in Warwickshire in 1693,testifies to it as coming from the old clerk who showed him overthe church, and it is unhesitatingly accepted as true by Mr.Halliwell-Phillipps. (Vol I, p. 11, and see Vol. II, p. 71, 72.)Mr. Sidney Lee sees nothing improbable in it, and it is supportedby Aubrey, who must have written his account some time before 1680,when his manuscript was completed. Of the attorney's clerkhypothesis, on the other hand, there is not the faintest vestige ofa tradition. It has been evolved out of the fertile imaginationsof embarrassed Stratfordians, seeking for some explanation of theStratford rustic's marvellous acquaintance with law and legal termsand legal life. But Mr. Churton Collins has not the leasthesitation in throwing over the tradition which has the warrant ofantiquity and setting up in its stead this ridiculous invention,for which not only is there no shred of positive evidence, butwhich, as Lord Campbell and Lord Penzance point out, is really putout of court by the negative evidence, since "no young man couldhave been at work in an attorney's office without being called uponcontinually to act as a witness, and in many other ways leavingtraces of his work and name." And as Mr. Edwards further pointsout, since the day when Lord Campbell's book was published (betweenforty and fifty years ago), "every old deed or will, to say nothingof other legal papers, dated during the period of WilliamShakespeare's youth, has been scrutinized over half a dozen shires,and not one signature of the young man has been found."
Moreover, if Shakespeare had served as clerk in an attorney'soffice it is clear that he must have so served for a considerableperiod in order to have gained (if indeed it is credible that hecould have so gained) his remarkable knowledge of law. Can we thenfor a moment believe that, if this had been so, tradition wouldhave been absolutely silent on the matter? That Dowdall's oldclerk, over eighty years of age, should have never heard of it(though he was sure enough about the butcher's apprentice), andthat all the other ancient witnesses should be in similarignorance!
But such are the methods of Stratfordian controversy. Tradition isto be scouted when it is found inconvenient, but cited asirrefragable truth when it suits the case. Shakespeare ofStratford was the author of the Plays and Poems, but the author ofthe Plays and Poems could not have been a butcher's apprentice.Away, therefore, with tradition. But the author of the Plays andPoems must have had a very large and a very accurate knowledge ofthe law. Therefore, Shakespeare of Stratford must have been anattorney's clerk! The method is simplicity itself. By similarreasoning Shakespeare has been made a country schoolmaster, asoldier, a physician, a printer, and a good many other thingsbeside, according to the inclination and the exigencies of thecommentator. It would not be in the least surprising to find thathe was studying Latin as a schoolmaster and law in an attorney'soffice at the same time.
However, we must do Mr. Collins the justice of saying that he hasfully recognized, what is indeed tolerably obvious, thatShakespeare must have had a sound legal training. "It may, ofcourse, be urged," he writes, "that Shakespeare's knowledge ofmedicine, and particularly that branch of it which related tomorbid psychology, is equally remarkable, and that no one has evercontended that he was a physician. (Here Mr. Collins is wrong;that contention also has been put forward.) It may be urged thathis acquaintance with the technicalities of other crafts andcallings, notably of marine and military affairs, was alsoextraordinary, and yet no one has suspected him of being a sailoror a soldier. (Wrong again. Why even Messrs. Garnett and Gosse'suspect' that he was a soldier!) This may be conceded, but theconcession hardly furnishes an analogy. To these and all othersubjects he recurs occasionally, and in season, but withreminiscences of the law his memory, as is abundantly clear, wassimply saturated. In season and out of season now in manifest, nowin recondite application, he presses it into the service ofexpression and illustration. At least a third of his myriadmetaphors are derived from it. It would indeed be difficult tofind a single act in any of his dramas, nay, in some of them, asingle scene, the diction and imagery of which is not colored byit. Much of his law may have been acquired from three books easilyaccessible to him, namely Tottell's Precedents (1572), Pulton'sStatutes (1578), and Fraunce's Lawier's Logike (1588), works withwhich he certainly seems to have been familiar; but much of itcould only have come from one who had an intimate acquaintance withlegal proceedings. We quite agree with Mr. Castle thatShakespeare's legal knowledge is not what could have been picked upin an attorney's office, but could only have been learned by anactual attendance at the Courts, at a Pleader's Chambers, and oncircuit, or by associating intimately with members of the Bench andBar."
This is excellent. But what is Mr. Collins' explanation. "Perhapsthe simplest solution of the problem is to accept the hypothesisthat in early life he was in an attorney's office (!), that hethere contracted a love for the law which never left him, that as ayoung man in London, he continued to study or dabble in it for hisamusement, to stroll in leisure hours into the Courts, and tofrequent the society of lawyers. On no other supposition is itpossible to explain the attraction which the law evidently had forhim, and his minute and undeviating accuracy in a subject where nolayman who has indulged in such copious and ostentatious display oflegal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in keeping himself fromtripping."
A lame conclusion. "No other supposition" indeed! Yes, there isanother, and a very obvious supposition, namely, that Shakespearewas himself a lawyer, well versed in his trade, versed in all theways of the courts, and living in close intimacy with judges andmembers of the Inns of Court.
One is, of course, thankful that Mr. Collins has appreciated thefact that Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training, but Imay be forgiven if I do not attach quite so much importance to hispronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those of Malone,Lord Campbell, Judge Holmes, Mr. Castle, K.C., Lord Penzance, Mr.Grant White, and other lawyers, who have expressed their opinion onthe matter of Shakespeare's legal acquirements.
Here it may, perhaps, be worth while to quote again from LordPenzance's book as to the suggestion that Shakespeare had somehowor other managed "to acquire a perfect familiarity with legalprinciples, and an accurate and ready use of the technical termsand phrases, not only of the conveyancer's office, but of thepleader's chambers and the courts at Westminster." This, as LordPenzance points out, "would require nothing short of employment insome career involving CONSTANT CONTACT with legal questions andgeneral legal work." But "in what portion of Shakespeare's careerwould it be possible to point out that time could be found for theinterposition of a legal employment in the chambers or offices ofpractising lawyers? . . . It is beyond doubt that at an earlyperiod he was called upon to abandon his attendance at school andassist his father, and was soon after, at the age of sixteen, boundapprentice to a trade. While under the obligation of this bond hecould not have pursued any other employment. Then he leavesStratford and comes to London. He has to provide himself with themeans of a livelihood, and this he did in some capacity at thetheatre. No one doubts that. The holding of horses is scouted bymany, and perhaps with justice, as being unlikely and certainlyunproved; but whatever the nature of his employment was at thetheatre, there is hardly room for the belief that it could havebeen other than continuous, for his progress there was so rapid.Ere long he had been taken into the company as an actor, and wassoon spoken of as a 'Johannes Factotum.' His rapid accumulation ofwealth speaks volumes for the constancy and activity of hisservices. One fails to see when there could be a break in thecurrent of his life at this period of it, giving room oropportunity for legal or indeed any other employment. 'In 1589,'says Knight, 'we have undeniable evidence that he had not only acasual engagement, was not only a salaried servant, as many playerswere, but was a shareholder in the company of the Queen's playerswith other shareholders below him on the list.' This (1589) wouldbe within two years after his arrival in London, which is placed byWhite and Halliwell-Phillipps about the year 1587. The difficultyin supposing that, starting with a state of ignorance in 1587, whenhe is supposed to have come to London, he was induced to enter upona course of most extended study and mental culture, is almostinsuperable. Still it was physically possible, provided alwaysthat he could have had access to the needful books. But this legaltraining seems to me to stand on a different footing. It is notonly unaccountable and incredible, but it is actually negatived bythe known facts of his career." Lord Penzance then refers to thefact that "by 1592 (according to the best authority, Mr. GrantWhite) several of the plays had been written. The Comedy of Errorsin 1589, Love's Labour's Lost in 1589, Two Gentlemen of Verona in1589 or 1590, and so forth, and then asks, "with this catalogue ofdramatic work on hand . . . was it possible that he could havetaken a leading part in the management and conduct of two theatres,and if Mr. Phillipps is to be relied upon, taken his share in theperformances of the provincial tours of his company--and at thesame time devoted himself to the study of the law in all itsbranches so efficiently as to make himself complete master of itsprinciples and practice, and saturate his mind with all its mosttechnical terms?"
I have cited this passage from Lord Penzance's book, because it laybefore me, and I had already quoted from it on the matter ofShakespeare's legal knowledge; but other writers have still betterset forth the insuperable difficulties, as they seem to me, whichbeset the idea that Shakespeare might have found time in someunknown period of early life, amid multifarious other occupations,for the study of classics, literature and law, to say nothing oflanguages and a few other matters. Lord Penzance further asks hisreaders: "Did you ever meet with or hear of an instance in which ayoung man in this country gave himself up to legal studies andengaged in legal employments, which is the only way of becomingfamiliar with the technicalities of practice, unless with the viewof practicing in that profession? I do not believe that it wouldbe easy, or indeed possible, to produce an instance in which thelaw has been seriously studied in all its branches, except as aqualification for practice in the legal profession."
This testimony is so strong, so direct, so authoritative; and souncheapened, unwatered by guesses, and surmises, and maybe-so's,and might-have-beens, and could-have-beens, and must-have-beens,and the rest of that ton of plaster of paris out of which thebiographers have built the colossal brontosaur which goes by theStratford actor's name, that it quite convinces me that the man whowrote Shakespeare's Works knew all about law and lawyers. Also,that that man could not have been the Stratford Shakespeare--andWASN'T.
Who did write these Works, then?
I wish I knew.
