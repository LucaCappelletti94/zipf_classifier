SCENE I
  Sunday morning.  Market-place of a large mining village in the  Midlands.  A man addressing a small gang of colliers from the  foot of a stumpy memorial obelisk.  Church bells heard.  Church-  goers passing along the outer pavements.
WILLIE HOUGHTON.  What's the matter with you folks, as I've told youbefore, and as I shall keep on telling you every now and again, thoughit doesn't make a bit of difference, is that you've got no idea offreedom whatsoever. I've lived in this blessed place for fifty years,and I've never seen the spark of an idea, nor of any response to anidea, come out of a single one of you, all the time.  I don't knowwhat it is with colliers--whether it's spending so much time in thebowels of the earth--but they never seem to be able to get theirthoughts above their bellies.  If you've got plenty to eat and drink,and a bit over to keep the missis quiet, you're satisfied.  I neversaw such a satisfied bloomin' lot in my life as you Barlow & Wasall'smen are, really.  Of course you can growse as well as anybody, andyou do growse.  But you don't do anything else.  You're stuck in asort of mud of contentment, and you feel yourselves sinking, but youmake no efforts to get out.  You bleat a bit, like sheep in a bog--butyou like it, you know.  You like sinking in--you don't have to standon your own feet then.
I'll tell you what'll happen to you chaps.  I'll give you a littlepicture of what you'll be like in the future.  Barlow & Walsall's 'llmake a number of compounds, such as they keep niggers in in SouthAfrica, and there you'll be kept.  And every one of you'll have alittle brass collar round his neck, with a number on it. You won'thave names any more.  And you'll go from the compound to the pit, andfrom the pit back again to the compound.  You won't be allowed to gooutside the gates, except at week-ends.  They'll let you go home toyour wives on Saturday nights, to stop over Sunday.  But you'll haveto be in again by half-past nine on Sunday night; and if you're late,you'll have your next week-end knocked off.  And there you'll be--and you'll be quite happy.  They'll give you plenty to eat, and a canof beer a day, and a bit of bacca--and they'll provide dominoes andskittles for you to play with.  And you'll be the most contented setof men alive.--But you won't be men.  You won't even be animals.You'll go from number one to number three thousand, a lot of numberedslaves--a new sort of slaves---
VOICE.  An' wheer shall thee be, Willie?
WILLIE.  Oh, I shall be outside the palings, laughing at you.  I shallhave to laugh, because it'll be your own faults.  You'll have nobodybut yourself to thank for it.  You don't WANT to be men.  You'd ratherNOT be free--much rather.  You're like those people spoken of inShakespeare: "Oh, how eager these men are to be slaves!"  I believeit's Shakespeare--or the Bible--one or the other--it mostly is---
ANABEL WRATH (she was passing to church).  It was Tiberius.
WILLIE.  Eh?
ANABEL.  Tiberius said it.
WILLIE.  Tiberius!--Oh, did he?  (Laughs.)  Thanks!  Well, if Tiberiussaid it, there must be something in it.  and he only just missed beingin the Bible anyway.  He was a day late, or they'd have had him in."Oh, how eager these men are to be slaves!"--It's evident the Romansdeserved all they got from Tiberius--and you'll deserve all you get,every bit of it.  But don't you bother, you'll get it.  You won't beat the mercy of Tiberius, you'll be at the mercy of something a jollysight worse.  Tiberius took the skin off a few Romans, apparently.But you'll have the soul taken out of you--every one of you.  And I'drather lose my skin than my soul, any day.  But perhaps you wouldn't.
VOICE.  What art makin' for, Willie?  Tha seems to say a lot, but thagoes round it.  Tha'rt like a donkey on a gin.  Tha gets ravelled.
WILLIE.  Yes, that's just it.  I am precisely like a donkey on a gin--a donkey that's trying to wind a lot of colliers up to the surface.There's many a donkey that's brought more colliers than you up to seedaylight, by trotting round.--But do you want to know what I'm makingfor?  I can soon tell you that.  You Barlow & Wasall's men, youhaven't a soul to call your own.  Barlow & Wasall's have only to sayto one of you, Come, and he cometh, Go, and he goeth, LieVOICE.  Ay--an' what about it?  Tha's got a behind o' thy own, hasn'tyer?
WILLIE.  Do you stand there and ask me what about it, and haven't thesense to alter it?  Couldn't you set up a proper Government to-morrow,if you liked?  Couldn't you contrive that the pits belonged to you,instead of you belonging to the pits, like so many old pit-ponies thatstop down till they are blind, and take to eating coal-slack formeadow-grass, not knowing the difference?  If only you'd learn tothink, I'd respect you.  As you are, I can't, not if I try my hardest.All you can think of is to ask for another shilling a day.  That's asfar as your imagination carries you. And perhaps you get sevenpenceha'penny, but pay for it with half-a-crown's worth of sweat.  Themasters aren't fools--as you are.  They'll give you two-thirds ofwhat you ask for, but they'll get five-thirds of it back again--andthey'll get it out of your flesh and blood, too, in jolly hard work.Shylock wasn't in it with them.  He only wanted a pound of flesh.But you cheerfully give up a pound a week, each one of you, and keepon giving it up.--But you don't seem to see these things.  You can'tthink beyond your dinners and your 'lowance.  You think if you can getanother shilling a day you're set up.  You make me tired, I tell you.
JOB ARTHUR FREER.  We think of others besides ourselves.
WILLIE.  Hello, Job Arthur--are you there?  I didn't recognise youwithout your frock-coat and  silk hat--on the Sabbath.--What was thatyou said?  You think of something else, besides yourselves?--Oh ay--I'm glad to hear it.  Did you mean your own importance?
(A motor car, GERALD BARLOW driving, OLIVER TURTON with him has     pulled up.)
JOB ARTHUR (glancing at the car).  No, I didn't.
WILLIE.  Didn't you, though?--Come, speak up, let us have it.  Themore the merrier.  You were going to say something.
JOB ARTHUR.  Nay, you were doing the talking.
WILLIE.  Yes, so I was, till you interrupted, with a great idea on thetip of your tongue.  Come, spit it out.  No matter if Mr. Barlow hearsyou.  You know how sorry for you we feel, that you've always got tomake your speeches twice--once to those above, and once to us herebelow I didn't meant the angels and the devils, but never mind.  Speakup, Job Arthur.
JOB ARTHUR.  It's not everybody as has as much to say as you, Mr.Houghton.
WILLIE.  No, not in the open--that's a fact.  Some folks says a greatdeal more, in semi-private.  You were just going to explain to me, onbehalf of the men, whom you so ably represent and so wisely lead, JobArthur--we won't say by the nose--you were just going to tell me--onbehalf of the men, of course, not of the masters--that you think ofothers, besides yourself.  Do you mind explaining WHAT others?
JOB ARTHUR.  Everybody's used to your talk, Mr. Houghton, and for thatreason it doesn't make much impression.  What I meant to say, in plainwords, was that we have to think of what's best for everybody, notonly of ourselves.
WILLIE.  Oh, I see.  What's best for everybody!  I see!  Well, formyself, I'm much obliged--there's nothing for us to do, gentlemen,but for all of us to bow acknowledgments to Mr. Job Arthur Freer, whoso kindly has ALL our interests at heart.
JOB ARTHUR.  I don't profess to be a red-rag Socialist.  I don'tpretend to think that if the Government had the pits it would be anybetter for us.  No.  What I mean is, that the pits are there and everyman on this place depends on them, one way or another.  They're thecow that gives the milk.  And what I mean is, how every man shall havea proper share of the milk, which is food and living.  It's likekilling the goose that laid the golden egg.  I want to keep the cowhealthy and strong.  And the cow is the pits, and we're the men thatdepend on the pits.
WILLIE.  Who's the cat that's going to lick the cream?
JOB ARTHUR.  My position is this--and I state it before masters andmen--that it's our business to strike such a balance between theinterests of the men and the interests of the masters that the pitsremain healthy, and everybody profits.
WILLIE.  You're out for the millennium, I can see--with Mr. Job ArthurFreer striking the balance.  We all see you, Job Arthur, one foot oneither side of the fence, balancing the see-saw, with masters at oneend and men at the other.  You'll have to give one side a lot ofpudding.--But go back a bit, to where we were before the motor cartook your breath away.  When you said, Job Arthur, that you think ofothers besides yourself, didn't you mean, as a matter of fact, theoffice men?  Didn't you mean that the colliers, led--we won't mentionnoses--by you, were going to come out in sympathy with the officeclerks, supposing they didn't get the rise in wages which they'veasked for--the office clerks?  Wasn't that it?
JOB ARTHUR.  There's been some talk among the men of standing by theoffice.  I don't know what they'll do.  But they'll do it of theirown decision, whatever it is.
WILLIE.  There's not a shadow of doubt about it, Job Arthur.  But it'sa funny thing the decisions all have the same foxy smell about them,Job Arthur.
OLIVER TURTON (calling from the car).  What was the speech about, inthe first place?
WILLIE.  I beg pardon?
OLIVER.  What was the address about, to begin with?
WILLIE.  Oh, the same old hat--Freedom.  But partly it's given toannoy the Unco Guid, as they pass to their Sabbath banquet of self-complacency.
OLIVER.  What ABOUT Freedom?
WILLIE.  Very much as usual, I believe.  But you should have been hereten minutes sooner, before we began to read the lessons.  (Laughs.)
ANABEL W. (moving forward, and holding out her hand).  You'd merelyhave been told what Freedom ISN'T; and you know that already.  Howare you, Oliver?
OLIVER.  Good God, Anabel!--are you part of the meeting?  How longhave you been back in England?
ANABEL.  Some months, now.  My family have moved here, you know.
OLIVER.  Your family!  Where have they moved from?--from the moon?
ANABEL.  No, only from Derby.--How are you, Gerald?
(GERALD twists in his seat to give her his hand.)
GERALD.  I saw you before.
ANABEL.  Yes, I know you did.
(JOB ARTHUR has disappeared.  The men disperse sheepishly into groups,     to stand and sit on their heels by the walls and the causeway     edge.  WILLIE HOUGHTON begins to talk to individuals.)
OLIVER.  Won't you get in and drive on with us a little way?
ANABEL.  No, I was going to church.
OLIVER.  Going to church!  Is that a new habit?
ANABEL.  Not a habit.  But I've been twice since I saw you last.
OLIVER.  I see.  And that's nearly two years ago.  It's an annualthing, like a birthday?
ANABEL.  No.  I'll go on, then.
OLIVER.  You'll be late now.
ANABEL.  Shall I?  It doesn't matter.
OLIVER.  We are going to see you again, aren't we?
ANABEL (after a pause).  Yes, I hope so, Oliver.
OLIVER.  How have you been these two years--well?--happy?
ANABEL.  No, neither.  How have you?
OLIVER.  Yes, fairly happy.  Have you been ill?
ANABEL.  Yes, in France I was very ill.
OLIVER.  Your old neuritis?
ANABEL.  No.  My chest.  Pneumonia--oh, a complication.
OLIVER.  How sickening!  Who looked after you?  Is it better?
ANABEL.  Yes, it's a great deal better.
OLIVER.  But, Anabel--we must fix a meeting.  I say, wait just amoment.  Could I call on your people?  Go into town with me one day.I don't know whether Gerald intends to see you--whether he intendsto ask you to Lilley Close.
GERALD.  Oh, it's all right.
ANABEL.  He's no need.  I'm fixed up there already.
GERALD.  What do you mean?
ANABEL.  I am at Lilley Close every day--or most days--to work withyour sister Winifred in the studio.
GERALD.  What?--why, how's that?
ANABEL.  Your father asked me.  My father was already giving her somelessons.
GERALD.  And you're at our house every day?
ANABEL.  Most days.
GERALD.  Well, I'm--well, I'll be--you managed it very sharp, didn'tyou?  I've only been away a fort-night.
ANABEL.  Your father asked me--he offered me twelve pounds a month--I wanted to do something.
GERALD.  Oh yes, but you didn't hire yourself out at Lilley Close asa sort of upper servant just for twelve pounds a month.
ANABEL.  You're wrong--you're wrong.  I'm not a sort of upper servantat all--not at all.
GERALD.  Oh, yes, you are, if you're paid twelve pounds a month--threepounds a week.  That's about what father's sick-nurse gets, I believe.You don't do it for twelve pounds a month.  You can make twelve poundsin a day, if you like to work at your little models: I know you cansell your statuette things as soon as you make them.
ANABEL.  But I CAN'T make them.  I CAN'T make them.  I've lost thespirit--the--_joi de vivre_--I don't know what, since I've been ill.I tell you I've GOT to earn something.
GERALD.  Nevertheless, you won't make me believe, Anabel, that you'vecome and buried yourself in the provinces--SUCH provinces--just toearn father's three pounds a week.  Why don't you admit it, that youcame back to try and take up the old threads.
OLIVER.  Why not, Gerald?  Don't you think we ought to take up theold threads?
GERALD.  I don't think we ought to be left without choice.  I don'tthink Anabel ought to come back and thrust herself on me--for that'swhat it amounts to, after all--when one remembers what's gone before.
ANABEL.  I DON'T thrust myself on you at all.  I know I'm a fool, afool, to come back.  But I wanted to.  I wanted to see you again.Now I know I've presumed.  I've made myself CHEAP to you.  I wantedto--I wanted to.  And now I've done it, I won't come to Lilley Closeagain, nor anywhere where you are.  Tell your father I have gone toFrance again--it will be true.
GERALD.  You play tricks on me--and on yourself.  You know you do.You do it for the pure enjoyment of it.  You're making a scene herein this filthy market-place, just for the fun of it.  You like tosee these accursed colliers standing eyeing you, and squatting ontheir heels.  You like to catch me out, here where I'm known, whereI've been the object of their eyes since I was born.  This is agreat _coup de main_ for you.  I knew it the moment I saw you here.
OLIVER.  After all, we ARE making a scene in the market-place.  Getin, Anabel, and we'll settle the dispute more privately.  I'm gladyou came back, anyhow.  I'm glad you came right down on us.  Get in,and let us run down to Whatmore.
ANABEL.  No, Oliver.  I don't want to run down to Whatmore.  I wantedto see you--I wanted to see Gerald--and I've seen him--and I've heardhim.  That will suffice me.  We'll make an end of the scene in themarket-place.  (She turns away.)
OLIVER.  I knew it wasn't ended.  I knew she would come back and tellus she'd come.  But she's done her bit--now she'll go again.  My God,what a fool of a world!--You go on, Gerald--I'll just go after herand see it out.  (Calls.)  One moment, Anabel.
ANABEL (calling).  Don't come, Oliver.  (Turns.)
GERALD.  Anabel!  (Blows the horn of the motor car violently andagitatively--she looks round--turns again as if frightened.)  Goddamn the woman!  (Gets down from the car.)  Drive home for me, Oliver.
(Curtain.)
SCENE II
  WINIFRED'S studio at Lilley Close.  ANABEL and WINIFRED working  at a model in clay.
WINIFRED.  But isn't it lovely to be in Paris, and to have exhibitions,and to be famous?
ANABEL.  Paris WAS a good place.  But I was never famous.
WINIFRED.  But your little animals and birds were famous.  Jack saidso.  You know he brought us that bronze thrush that is singing, thatis in his room.  He has only let me see it twice.  It's the loveliestthing I've ever seen.  Oh, if I can do anything like that!--I'veworshipped it, I have.  It is your best thing?
ANABEL.  One of the best.
WINIFRED.  It must be.  When I see it, with its beak lifted, singing,something comes loose in my heart, and I feel as if I should cry, andfly up to heaven.  Do you know what I mean?  Oh, I'm sure you do, oryou could never have made that thrush.  Father is so glad you've cometo show me how to work.  He says now I shall have a life-work, and Ishall be happy.  It's true, too.
ANABEL.  Yes, till the life-work collapses.
WINIFRED.  Oh, it can't collapse.  I can't believe it could collapse.Do tell me about something else you made, which you loved--somethingyou sculpted.  Oh, it makes my heart burn to hear you!--Do you thinkI might call you Anabel?  I should love to.  You do call me Winifredalready.
ANABEL.  Yes, do.
WINIFRED.  Won't you tell me about something else you made--somethinglovely?
ANABEL.  Well, I did a small kitten--asleep--with its paws crossed.You know, Winifred, that wonderful look that kittens have, as if theywere blown along like a bit of fluff--as if they weighed nothing atall, just wafted about--and yet so ALIVE--do you know---?
WINIFRED.  Darlings--darlings--I  love them!
ANABEL.  Well my kitten really came off--it had that quality.  Itlooked as if it had just wafted there.
WINIFRED.  Oh, yes!--oh, I know!  And was it in clay?
ANABEL.  I cut it in soft grey stone as well.  I love my kitten.  AnArmenian bought her.
WINIFRED.  And where is she now?
ANABEL.  I don't know--in Armenia, I suppose, if there is such aplace.  It would have to be kept under glass, because the stonewouldn't polish--and I didn't want it polished.  But I dislikethings under glass--don't you?
WINIFRED.  Yes, I do.  We had a golden clock, but Gerald wouldn'thave the glass cover, and Daddy wouldn't have it without.  So nowthe clock is in father's room.  Gerald often went to Paris.  Oliverused to have a studio there.  I don't care much for painting, do you?
ANABEL.  No.  I want something I can touch, if it's something outsideme.
WINIFRED.  Yes, isn't it wonderful, when things are substantial.Gerald and Oliver came back yesterday from Yorkshire.  You know wehave a colliery there.
ANABEL.  Yes, I believe I've heard.
WINIFRED.  I want to introduce you to Gerald, to see if you like him.He's good at the bottom, but he's very overbearing and definite.
ANABEL.  Is he?
WINIFRED.  Terribly clever in business.  He'll get awfully rich.
ANABEL.  Isn't he rich enough already?
WINIFRED.  Oh, yes, because Daddy is rich enough, really.  I thinkif Gerald was a bit different, he'd be really nice.  Now he's soMANAGING.  It's sickening.  Do you dislike managing people, Anabel?
ANABEL.  I dislike them extremely, Winifred.
WINIFRED.  They're such a bore.
ANABEL.  What does Gerald manage?
WINIFRED.  Everything.  You know he's revolutionised the collieriesand the whole Company.  He's made a whole new thing of it, so MODERN.Father says he almost wishes he'd let it die out--let the pits beclosed.  But I suppose things MUST be modernised, don't you think?Though it's very unpeaceful, you know, really.
ANABEL.  Decidedly unpeaceful, I should say.
WINIFRED.  The colliers work awfully hard.  The pits are quitewonderful now.  Father says it's against nature--all this electricityand so on.  Gerald adores electricity.  Isn't it curious?
ANABEL.  Very.  How are you getting on?
WINIFRED.  I don't know.  It's so hard to make things BALANCE as ifthey were alive.  Where IS the balance in a thing that's alive?
ANABEL.  The poise?  Yes, Winifred--to me, all the secret of life is inthat--just the--the inexpressible poise of a living thing, that makesit so different from a dead thing.  To me it's the soul, you know--allliving things have it--flowers, trees as well.  It makes life alwaysmarvellous.
WINIFRED.  Ah, yes!--ah, yes!  If only I could put it in my model.
ANABEL.  I think you will.  You are a sculptor, Winifred.--Isn'tthere someone there?
WINIFRED (running to the door).  Oh, Oliver!
OLIVER.  Hello, Winnie!  Can I come in?  This is your sanctum: youcan keep us out if you like.
WINIFRED.  Oh, no.  Do you know Miss Wrath, Oliver?  She's a famoussculptress.
OLIVER.  Is she?  We have met.--Is Winifred going to make asculptress, do you think?
ANABEL.  I do.
OLIVER.  Good!  I like your studio, Winnie.  Awfully nice up hereover the out-buildings.  Are you happy in it?
WINIFRED.  Yes, I'm perfectly happy--only I shall NEVER be able tomake real models, Oliver--it's so difficult.
OLIVER.  Fine room for a party--Give us a studio party one day, Win,and we'll dance.
WINIFRED (flying to him).  Yes, Oliver, do let us dance.  What shallwe dance to?
OLIVER.  Dance?--Dance _Vigni-vignons_--we all know that.  Ready?
WINIFRED.  Yes.
(They begin to sing, dancing meanwhile, in a free little ballet-     manner, a wine-dance, dancing separate and then together.)
          De terre en vigne,          La voila la jolie vigne,          Vigni-vignons--vignons le vin,          La voila la jolie vigne au vin,          La voila la jolie vigne.
OLIVER.  Join in--join in, all.
(ANABEL joins in; the three dance and move in rhythm.)
WINIFRED.  I love it--I love it!  Do _Ma capote a trois boutons_--youknow it, don't you, Anabel?  Ready--now---
(They begin to dance to a quick little march-rhythm, all singing and     dancing till they are out of breath.)
OLIVER.  Oh!--tired!--let us sit down.
WINIFRED.  Oliver!--oh, Oliver!--I LOVE you and Anabel.
OLIVER.  Oh, Winifred, I brought you a present--you'll love me morenow.
WINIFRED.  Yes, I shall.  Do give it me.
OLIVER.  I left it in the morning-room.  I put it on the mantel-piecefor you.
WINIFRED.  Shall I go for it?
OLIVER.  There it is, if you want it.
WINIFRED.  Yes--do you mind?  I won't be long.  (Exit.)
OLIVER.  She's a nice child.
ANABEL.  A VERY nice child.
OLIVER.  Why did you come back, Anabel?
ANABEL.  Why does the moon rise, Oliver?
OLIVER.  For some mischief or other, so they say.
ANABEL.  You think I came back for mischief's sake?
OLIVER.  Did you?
ANABEL.  No.
OLIVER.  Ah!
ANABEL.  Tell me, Oliver, how is everything now?--how is it with you?--how is it between us all?
OLIVER.  How is it between us all?--How ISN'T it, is more the mark.
ANABEL.  Why?
OLIVER.  You made a fool of us.
ANABEL.  Of whom?
OLIVER.  Well--of Gerald particularly--and of me.
ANABEL.  How did I make a fool of you, Oliver?
OLIVER.  That you know best, Anabel.
ANABEL.  No, I don't know.  Was it ever right between Gerald and me,all the three years we knew each other--we were together?
OLIVER.  Was it all wrong?
ANABEL.  No, not all.  But it was terrible.  It was terrible, Oliver.You don't realise.  You don't realise how awful passion can be, whenit never resolves, when it never becomes anything else.  It is hate,really.
OLIVER.  What did you want the passion to resolve into?
ANABEL.  I was blinded--maddened.  Gerald stung me and stung me tillI was mad.  I left him for reason's sake, for sanity's sake.  Weshould have killed one another.
OLIVER.  You, stung him, too, you know--and pretty badly, at the last:you dehumanised him.
ANABEL.  When?  When I left him, you mean?
OLIVER.  Yes, when you went away with that Norwegian--playing yourgame a little too far.
ANABEL.  Yes, I knew you'd blame me.  I knew you'd be against me.But don't you see, Oliver, you helped to make it impossible for us.
OLIVER.  Did I?  I didn't intend to.
ANABEL.  Ha, ha, Oliver!  Your good intentions!  They are too good tobear investigation, my friend.  Ah, but for your good and friendlyintentions---
OLIVER.  You mean my friendship with Gerald went against you?
ANABEL.  Yes.  And your friendship with me went against Gerald.
OLIVER.  So I am the devil in the piece.
ANABEL.  You see, Oliver, Gerald loved you far too well ever to loveme altogether.  He loved us both.  But the Gerald that loved you sodearly, old, old friends as you were, and TRUSTED you, he turned aterrible face of contempt on me.  You don't know, Oliver, the coldedge of Gerald's contempt for me--because he was so secure and strongin his old friendship with you.  You don't know his sneering attitudeto me in the deepest things with you.  He had a passion for me.  Buthe loved you.
OLIVER.  Well, he doesn't any more.  We went apart after you had gone.The friendship has become almost casual.
ANABEL.  You see how bitterly you speak.
OLIVER.  Yet you didn't hate me, Anabel.
ANABEL.  No, Oliver--I was AWFULLY fond of you.  I trusted you--and Itrust you still.  You see I knew how fond Gerald was of you.  And Ihad to respect this feeling.  So I HAD to be aware of you: and I HADto be conscious of you: in a way, I had to love you.  You understandhow I mean?  Not with the same fearful love with which I loved Gerald.You seemed to me warm and protecting--like a brother, you know--but abrother one LOVES.
OLIVER.  And then you hated me?
ANABEL.  Yes, I had to hate you.
OLIVER.  And you hated Gerald?
ANABEL.  Almost to madness--almost to madness.
OLIVER.  Then you went away with that Norwegian.  What of him?
ANABEL.  What of him?  Well, he's dead.
OLIVER.  Ah!  That's why you came back?
ANABEL.  No, no.  I came back because my only hope in life was incoming back.  Baard was beautiful--and awful.  You know howglisteningly blond he was.  Oliver, have you ever watched the polarbears?  He was cold as iron when it is so cold that it burns you.Coldness wasn't negative with him.  It was positive--and awfulbeyond expression--like the aurora borealis.
OLIVER.  I wonder you ever got back.
ANABEL.  Yes, so do I.  I feel as if I'd fallen down a fissure in theice.  Yet I have come back, haven't I?
OLIVER.  God knows!  At least, Anabel, we've gone through too muchever to start the old game again.  There'll be no more sticky lovebetween us.
ANABEL.  No, I think there won't, either.
OLIVER.  And what of Gerald?
ANABEL.  I don't know.  What do you think of him?
OLIVER.  I can't think any more.  I can only blindly go from day today, now.
ANABEL.  So can I.  Do you think I was wrong to come back?  Do youthink I wrong Gerald?
OLIVER.  No. I'm glad you came.  But I feel I can't KNOW anything.We must just go on.
ANABEL.  Sometimes I feel I ought never to have come to Gerald again--never--never--never.
OLIVER.  Just left the gap?--Perhaps, if everything has to comeasunder.  But I think, if ever there is to be life--hope,--then youhad to come back.  I always knew it.  There is something eternalbetween you and him;  and if there is to be any happiness, it dependson that.  But perhaps there is to BE no happiness--for our part ofthe world.
ANABEL (after a pause).  Yet I feel hope--don't you?
OLIVER.  Yes, sometimes.
ANABEL.  It seemed to me, especially that winter in Norway,--I canhardly express it,--as if any moment life might give way under one,like thin ice, and one would be more than dead.  And then I knew myonly hope was here--the only hope.
OLIVER.  Yes, I believe it.  And I believe---
(Enter MRS. BARLOW.)
MRS. BARLOW.  Oh, I wanted to speak to you, Oliver.
OLIVER.  Shall I come across?
MRS. BARLOW.  No, not now.  I believe father is coming here withGerald.
OLIVER.  Is he going to walk so far?
MRS. BARLOW.  He will do it.--I suppose you know Oliver?
ANABEL.  Yes, we have met before.
MRS. BARLOW (to OLIVER).  You didn't mention it.  Where have you metMiss Wrath?  She's been about the world, I believe.
ANABEL.  About the world?--no, Mrs. Barlow.  If one happens to knowParis and London---
MRS. BARLOW.  Paris and London!  Well, I don't say you are alltogether an adventuress.  My husband seems very pleased with you--for Winifred's sake, I suppose--and he's wrapped up in Winifred.
ANABEL.  Winifred is an artist.
MRS. BARLOW.  All my children have the artist in them.  They get itfrom my family.  My father went mad in Rome.  My family is born witha black fate--they all inherit it.
OLIVER.  I believe one is master of one's fate sometimes, Mrs. Barlow.There are moments of pure choice.
MRS. BARLOW.  Between two ways to the same end, no doubt.  There's nochanging the end.
OLIVER.  I think there is.
MRS. BARLOW.  Yes, you have a _parvenu's_ presumptuousness somewhereabout you.
OLIVER.  Well, better than a blue-blooded fatalism.
MRS. BARLOW.  The fate is in the blood: you can't change the blood.
(Enter WINIFRED.)
WINIFRED.  Oh, thank you, Oliver, for the wolf and the goat, thankyou so much!--The wolf has sprung on the goat, Miss Wrath, and hasher by the throat.
ANABEL.  The wolf?
OLIVER.  It's a little marble group--Italian--in hard marble.
WINIFRED.  The wolf--I love the wolf--he pounces so beautifully.His backbone is so terribly fierce.  I don't feel a bit sorry forthe goat, somehow.
OLIVER.  I didn't.  She is too much like the wrong sort of clergyman.
WINIFRED.  Yes--such a stiff, long face.  I wish he'd kill her.
MRS. BARLOW.  There's a wish!
WINIFRED.  Father and Gerald are coming.  That's them, I suppose.
(Enter MR. BARLOW and GERALD.)
MR. BARLOW.  Ah, good morning--good morning--quite a little gathering!Ah---
OLIVER.  The steps tire you, Mr. Barlow.
MR. BARLOW.  A little--a little--thank you.--Well, Miss Wrath, areyou quite comfortable here?
ANABEL.  Very comfortable, thanks.
GERALD.  It was clever of you, father, to turn this place into astudio.
MR. BARLOW.  Yes, Gerald.  You make the worldly schemes, and I thehomely.  Yes, it's a delightful place.  I shall come here often ifthe two young ladies will allow me.--By the way, Miss Wrath, I don'tknow if you have been introduced to my son Gerald.  I beg yourpardon.  Miss Wrath, Gerald--my son, Miss Wrath.  (They bow.)  Well,we are quite a gathering, quite a pleasant little gathering.  Wenever expected anything so delightful a month ago, did we, Winifred,darling?
WINIFRED.  No, daddy, it's much nicer than expectations.
MR. BARLOW.  So it is, dear--to have such exceptional companionshipand such a pleasant retreat.  We are very happy to have Miss Wrathwith us--very happy.
GERALD.  A studio's awfully nice, you know; it is such a retreat.  Anewspaper has no effect in it--falls quite flat, no matter what theheadlines are.
MR. BARLOW.  Quite true, Gerald, dear.  It is a sanctum the worldcannot invade--unlike all other sanctuaries, I am afraid.
GERALD.  By the way, Oliver--to go back to profanities--the colliersreally are coming out in support of the poor, ill-used clerks.
MR. BARLOW.  No, no, Gerald--no, no!  Don't be such an alarmist.  Letus leave these subjects before the ladies.  No, no: the clerks willhave their increase quite peacefully.
GERALD.  Yes, dear father--but they can't have it peacefully now.We've been threatened already by the colliers--we've already receivedan ultimatum.
MR. BARLOW.  Nonsense, my boy--nonsense!  Don't let us split words.You won't go against the clerks in such a small matter.  Always avoidtrouble over small matters.  Don't make bad feeling--don't make badblood.
MRS. BARLOW.  The blood is already rotten in the neighbourhood.  Whatit needs is letting out.  We need a few veins opening, or we shallhave mortification setting in.  The blood is black.
MR. BARLOW.  We won't accept your figure of speech literally, dear.No, Gerald, don't go to war over trifles.
GERALD.  It's just over trifles that one must make war, father.  Onecan yield gracefully over big matters.  But to be bullied over triflesis a sign of criminal weakness.
MR. BARLOW.  Ah, not so, not so, my boy.  When you are as old as I am,you will know the comparative insignificance of these trifles.
GERALD.  The older _I_ get, father, the more such trifles stick in mythroat.
MR. BARLOW.  Ah, it is an increasingly irritable disposition in you,my child.  Nothing costs so bitterly, in the end, as a stubborn pride.
MRS. BARLOW.  Except a stubborn humility--and that will cost you more.Avoid humility, beware of stubborn humility: it degrades.  Hark,Gerald--fight!  When the occasion comes, fight!  If it's one againstfive thousand, fight!  Don't give them your heart on a dish!  Never!If they want to eat your heart out, make them fight for it, and thengive it them poisoned at last, poisoned with your own blood.--What doyou say, young woman?
ANABEL.  Is it for me to speak, Mrs. Barlow?
MRS. BARLOW.  Weren't you asked?
ANABEL.  Certainly I would NEVER give the world my heart on a dish.But can't there ever be peace--real peace?
MRS. BARLOW.  No--not while there is devilish enmity.
MR. BARLOW.  You are wrong, dear, you are wrong.  The peace can come,the peace that passeth all understanding.
MRS. BARLOW.  That there is already between me and Almighty God.  I amat peace with the God that made me, and made me proud.  With men whohumiliate me I am at war.  Between me and the shameful humble thereis war to the end, though they are millions and I am one.  I hate thepeople.  Between my race and them and my children--for ever war, forever and ever.
MR. BARLOW.  Ah, Henrietta--you have said all this before.
MRS. BARLOW.  And say it again.  Fight, Gerald.  You have my blood inyou, thank God.  Fight for it, Gerald.  Spend it as if it were costly,Gerald, drop by drop.  Let no dogs lap it.--Look at your father.  Heset his heart on a plate at the door, for the poorest mongrel to eatup.  See him now, wasted and crossed out like a mistake--and swear,Gerald, swear to be true to my blood in you.  Never lie down beforethe mob, Gerald.  Fight it and stab it, and die fighting.  It's alost hope--but fight!
GERALD.  Don't say these things here, mother.
MRS. BARLOW.  Yes, I will--I will.  I'll say them before you, and thechild Winifred--she knows.  And before Oliver and the young woman--they know, too.
MR. BARLOW.  You see, dear, you can never understand that, although Iam weak and wasted, although I may be crossed out from the world likea mistake, I still have peace in my soul, dear, the peach that passethall understanding.
MRS. BARLOW.  And what right have you to it?  All very well for youto take peace with you into the other world.  What do you leave foryour sons to inherit?
MR. BARLOW.  The peace of God, Henrietta, if there is no peace amongmen.
MRS. BARLOW.  Then why did you have children?  Why weren't youcelibate?  They have to live among men.  If they have no place amongmen, why have you put them there?  If the peace of God is no morethan the peace of death, why are your sons born of you?  How can youhave peace with God, if you leave no peace for your sons--no peace,no pride, no place on earth?
GERALD.  Nay, mother, nay.  You shall never blame father on my behalf.
MRS. BARLOW.  Don't trouble--he is blameless--I, a hulking, half-demented woman, I am GLAD when you blame me.  But don't blame me whenI tell you to fight.  Don't do that, or you will regret it when youmust die.  Ah, your father was stiff and proud enough before men ofbetter rank than himself.  He was overbearing enough with his equalsand his betters.  But he humbled himself before the poor, he made meashamed.  He must hear it--he must hear it!  Better he should hear itthan die coddling himself with peace.  His humility, and my pride,they have made a nice ruin of each other.  Yet he is the man I wantedto marry--he is the man I would marry again.  But never, never againwould I give way before his goodness.  Gerald, if you must be true toyour father, be true to me as well.  Don't set me down at nothingbecause I haven't a humble case.
GERALD.  No, mother--no, dear mother.  You see, dear mother, I haverather a job between the two halves of myself.  When you come to havethe wild horses in your own soul, mother, it makes it difficult.
MRS. BARLOW.  Never mind, you'll have help.
GERALD.  Thank you for the assurance, darling.--Father, you don't mindwhat mother says, I hope.  I believe there's some truth in it--don'tyou?
MR. BARLOW.  I have nothing to say.
WINIFRED.  _I_ think there's some truth in it, daddy.  You were alwaysworrying about those horrid colliers, and they didn't care a bit aboutyou.  And they OUGHT to gave cared a million pounds.
MR. BARLOW.  You don't understand, my child.
(Curtain.)
