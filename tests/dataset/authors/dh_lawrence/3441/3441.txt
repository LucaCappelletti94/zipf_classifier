  She bade me follow to her garden, where	The mellow sunlight stood as in a cup	Between the old grey walls; I did not dare	To raise my face, I did not dare look up,	Lest her bright eyes like sparrows should fly in My windows of discovery, and shrill "Sin."	 So with a downcast mien and laughing voice	I followed, followed the swing of her white dress	That rocked in a lilt along: I watched the poise	Of her feet as they flew for a space, then paused to press The grass deep down with the royal burden of her:	And gladly I'd offered my breast to the tread of her.	 "I like to see," she said, and she crouched her down,	She sunk into my sight like a settling bird;	And her bosom couched in the confines of her gown Like heavy birds at rest there, softly stirred	By her measured breaths: "I like to see," said she,	"The snap dragon put out his tongue at me."	 She laughed, she reached her hand out to the flower,	Closing its crimson throat. My own throat in her power Strangled, my heart swelled up so full	As if it would burst its wine-skin in my throat,	Choke me in my own crimson. I watched her pull	The gorge of the gaping flower, till the blood did float	 

      Over my eyes, and I was blind--	            Her large brown hand stretched over	    The windows of my mind;	    And there in the dark I did discover	    Things I was out to find:	    My Grail, a brown bowl twined	            With swollen veins that met in the wrist,	    Under whose brown the amethyst	    I longed to taste. I longed to turn	    My heart's red measure in her cup,	    I longed to feel my hot blood burn	            With the amethyst in her cup.	     Then suddenly she looked up,	    And I was blind in a tawny-gold day,	    Till she took her eyes away.	    So she came down from above	            And emptied my heart of love.	    So I held my heart aloft	    To the cuckoo that hung like a dove,	    And she settled soft.	       It seemed that I and the morning world	              Were pressed cup-shape to take this reiver	      Bird who was weary to have furled	      Her wings in us,	      As we were weary to receive her.	       This bird, this rich,	              Sumptuous central grain,	      This mutable witch,	      This one refrain,	      This laugh in the fight,	      This clot of night,	              This core of delight.	     She spoke, and I closed my eyes	    To shut hallucinations out.	    I echoed with surprise	    Hearing my mere lips shout	            The answer they did devise.	    Again I saw a brown bird hover	    Over the flowers at my feet;	    I felt a brown bird hover	    Over my heart, and sweet	            Its shadow lay on my heart.	    I thought I saw on the clover	    A brown bee pulling apart	    The closed flesh of the clover	    And burrowing in its heart.	             She moved her hand, and again	    I felt the brown bird cover	    My heart; and then	    The bird came down on my heart,	    As on a nest the rover	            Cuckoo comes, and shoves over	    The brim each careful part	    Of love, takes possession, and settles her down,	    With her wings and her feathers to drown	    The nest in a heat of love.	         

She turned her flushed face to me for the glint	Of a moment. "See," she laughed, "if you also	Can make them yawn." I put my hand to the dint	In the flower's throat, and the flower gaped wide with woe.	She watched, she went of a sudden intensely still, She watched my hand, to see what I would fulfil.	 I pressed the wretched, throttled flower between	My fingers, till its head lay back, its fangs	Poised at her. Like a weapon my hand was white and keen,	And I held the choked flower-serpent in its pangs Of mordant anguish, till she ceased to laugh,	Until her pride's flag, smitten, cleaved down to the staff.	 She hid her face, she murmured between her lips	The low word "Don't." I let the flower fall,	But held my hand afloat towards the slips Of blossom she fingered, and my fingers all	Put forth to her: she did not move, nor I,	For my hand like a snake watched hers, that could not fly.	 Then I laughed in the dark of my heart, I did exult	Like a sudden chuckling of music. I bade her eyes Meet mine, I opened her helpless eyes to consult	Their fear, their shame, their joy that underlies	Defeat in such a battle. In the dark of her eyes	My heart was fierce to make her laughter rise.	 Till her dark deeps shook with convulsive thrills, and the dark Of her spirit wavered like water thrilled with light;	And my heart leaped up in longing to plunge its stark	Fervour within the pool of her twilight,	Within her spacious soul, to grope in delight.	 And I do not care, though the large hands of revenge Shall get my throat at last, shall get it soon,	If the joy that they are searching to avenge	Have risen red on my night as a harvest moon,	Which even death can only put out for me;	And death, I know, is better than not-to-be.
