It is more trouble to make a maxim than it is to do right. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
On the seventh day out we saw a dim vast bulk standing up out of thewastes of the Pacific and knew that that spectral promontory was DiamondHead, a piece of this world which I had not seen before for twenty-nineyears. So we were nearing Honolulu, the capital city of the SandwichIslands--those islands which to me were Paradise; a Paradise which I hadbeen longing all those years to see again. Not any other thing in theworld could have stirred me as the sight of that great rock did.
In the night we anchored a mile from shore. Through my port I could seethe twinkling lights of Honolulu and the dark bulk of the mountain-rangethat stretched away right and left. I could not make out the beautifulNuuana valley, but I knew where it lay, and remembered how it used tolook in the old times. We used to ride up it on horseback in those days--we young people--and branch off and gather bones in a sandy regionwhere one of the first Kamehameha's battles was fought. He was aremarkable man, for a king; and he was also a remarkable man for asavage. He was a mere kinglet and of little or no consequence at thetime of Captain Cook's arrival in 1788; but about four years afterward heconceived the idea of enlarging his sphere of influence. That is acourteous modern phrase which means robbing your neighbor--for yourneighbor's benefit; and the great theater of its benevolences is Africa.Kamehameha went to war, and in the course of ten years he whipped out allthe other kings and made himself master of every one of the nine or tenislands that form the group. But he did more than that. He boughtships, freighted them with sandal wood and other native products, andsent them as far as South America and China; he sold to his savages theforeign stuffs and tools and utensils which came back in these ships, andstarted the march of civilization. It is doubtful if the match to thisextraordinary thing is to be found in the history of any other savage.Savages are eager to learn from the white man any new way to kill eachother, but it is not their habit to seize with avidity and apply withenergy the larger and nobler ideas which he offers them. The details ofKamehameha's history show that he was always hospitably ready to examinethe white man's ideas, and that he exercised a tidy discrimination inmaking his selections from the samples placed on view.
A shrewder discrimination than was exhibited by his son and successor,Liholiho, I think. Liholiho could have qualified as a reformer, perhaps,but as a king he was a mistake. A mistake because he tried to be bothking and reformer. This is mixing fire and gunpowder together. A kinghas no proper business with reforming. His best policy is to keep thingsas they are; and if he can't do that, he ought to try to make them worsethan they are. This is not guesswork; I have thought over this matter agood deal, so that if I should ever have a chance to become a king Iwould know how to conduct the business in the best way.
When Liholiho succeeded his father he found himself possessed of anequipment of royal tools and safeguards which a wiser king would haveknown how to husband, and judiciously employ, and make profitable. Theentire country was under the one scepter, and his was that scepter.There was an Established Church, and he was the head of it. There was aStanding Army, and he was the head of that; an Army of 114 privates undercommand of 27 Generals and a Field Marshal. There was a proud andancient Hereditary Nobility. There was still one other asset. This wasthe tabu--an agent endowed with a mysterious and stupendous power, anagent not found among the properties of any European monarch, a tool ofinestimable value in the business. Liholiho was headmaster of the tabu.The tabu was the most ingenious and effective of all the inventions thathas ever been devised for keeping a people's privileges satisfactorilyrestricted.
It required the sexes to live in separate houses. It did not allowpeople to eat in either house; they must eat in another place. It didnot allow a man's woman-folk to enter his house. It did not allow thesexes to eat together; the men must eat first, and the women must wait onthem. Then the women could eat what was left--if anything was left--andwait on themselves. I mean, if anything of a coarse or unpalatable sortwas left, the women could have it. But not the good things, the finethings, the choice things, such as pork, poultry, bananas, cocoanuts, thechoicer varieties of fish, and so on. By the tabu, all these were sacredto the men; the women spent their lives longing for them and wonderingwhat they might taste like; and they died without finding out.
These rules, as you see, were quite simple and clear. It was easy toremember them; and useful. For the penalty for infringing any rule inthe whole list was death. Those women easily learned to put up withshark and taro and dog for a diet when the other things were soexpensive.
It was death for any one to walk upon tabu'd ground; or defile a tabu'dthing with his touch; or fail in due servility to a chief; or step uponthe king's shadow. The nobles and the King and the priests were alwayssuspending little rags here and there and yonder, to give notice to thepeople that the decorated spot or thing was tabu, and death lurking near.The struggle for life was difficult and chancy in the islands in thosedays.
Thus advantageously was the new king situated. Will it be believed thatthe first thing he did was to destroy his Established Church, root andbranch? He did indeed do that. To state the case figuratively, he was aprosperous sailor who burnt his ship and took to a raft. This Church wasa horrid thing. It heavily oppressed the people; it kept them alwaystrembling in the gloom of mysterious threatenings; it slaughtered them insacrifice before its grotesque idols of wood and stone; it cowed them, itterrorized them, it made them slaves to its priests, and through thepriests to the king. It was the best friend a king could have, and themost dependable. To a professional reformer who should annihilate sofrightful and so devastating a power as this Church, reverence and praisewould be due; but to a king who should do it, could properly be duenothing but reproach; reproach softened by sorrow; sorrow for hisunfitness for his position.
He destroyed his Established Church, and his kingdom is a republic today,in consequence of that act.
When he destroyed the Church and burned the idols he did a mighty thingfor civilization and for his people's weal--but it was not "business."It was unkingly, it was inartistic. It made trouble for his line. TheAmerican missionaries arrived while the burned idols were still smoking.They found the nation without a religion, and they repaired the defect.They offered their own religion and it was gladly received. But it wasno support to arbitrary kingship, and so the kingly power began to weakenfrom that day. Forty-seven years later, when I was in the islands,Kainehameha V. was trying to repair Liholiho's blunder, and notsucceeding. He had set up an Established Church and made himself thehead of it. But it was only a pinchbeck thing, an imitation, a bauble,an empty show. It had no power, no value for a king. It could not harryor burn or slay, it in no way resembled the admirable machine whichLiholiho destroyed. It was an Established Church without anEstablishment; all the people were Dissenters.
Long before that, the kingship had itself become but a name, a show. Atan early day the missionaries had turned it into something very much likea republic; and here lately the business whites have turned it intosomething exactly like it.
In Captain Cook's time (1778), the native population of the islands wasestimated at 400,000; in 1836 at something short of 200,000, in 1866 at50,000; it is to-day, per census, 25,000. All intelligent people praiseKamehameha I. and Liholiho for conferring upon their people the greatboon of civilization. I would do it myself, but my intelligence is outof repair, now, from over-work.
When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago, I was acquainted witha young American couple who had among their belongings an attractivelittle son of the age of seven--attractive but not practicablycompanionable with me, because he knew no English. He had played fromhis birth with the little Kanakas on his father's plantation, and hadpreferred their language and would learn no other. The family removed toAmerica a month after I arrived in the islands, and straightway the boybegan to lose his Kanaka and pick up English. By the time he was twelvebe hadn't a word of Kanaka left; the language had wholly departed fromhis tongue and from his comprehension. Nine years later, when he wastwenty-one, I came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York,and the mother told me about an adventure which her son had been having.By trade he was now a professional diver. A passenger boat had beencaught in a storm on the lake, and had gone down, carrying her peoplewith her. A few days later the young diver descended, with his armor on,and entered the berth-saloon of the boat, and stood at the foot of thecompanionway, with his hand on the rail, peering through the dim water.Presently something touched him on the shoulder, and he turned and founda dead man swaying and bobbing about him and seemingly inspecting himinquiringly. He was paralyzed with fright. His entry had disturbed thewater, and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him andwagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying todance. His senses forsook him, and in that condition he was drawn to thesurface. He was put to bed at home, and was soon very ill. During somedays he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time; andwhile they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly; and Kanakaonly. He was still very ill, and he talked to me in that tongue; but Idid not understand it, of course. The doctor-books tell us that caseslike this are not uncommon. Then the doctors ought to study the casesand find out how to multiply them. Many languages and things get mislaidin a person's head, and stay mislaid for lack of this remedy.
Many memories of my former visit to the islands came up in my mind whilewe lay at anchor in front of Honolulu that night. And pictures--picturespictures--an enchanting procession of them! I was impatient for themorning to come.
When it came it brought disappointment, of course. Cholera had brokenout in the town, and we were not allowed to have any communication withthe shore. Thus suddenly did my dream of twenty-nine years go to ruin.Messages came from friends, but the friends themselves I was not to haveany sight of. My lecture-hall was ready, but I was not to see that,either.
Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu, and these were sentashore; but nobody could go ashore and return. There were people onshore who were booked to go with us to Australia, but we could notreceive them; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term in Sydney. Theycould have escaped the day before, by ship to San Francisco; but the barshad been put up, now, and they might have to wait weeks before any shipcould venture to give them a passage any whither. And there werehardships for others. An elderly lady and her son, recreation-seekersfrom Massachusetts, had wandered westward, further and further from home,always intending to take the return track, but always concluding to gostill a little further; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulupositively their last westward-bound indulgence--they had made up theirminds to that--but where is the use in making up your mind in this world?It is usually a waste of time to do it. These two would have to staywith us as far as Australia. Then they could go on around the world, orgo back the way they had come; the distance and the accommodations andoutlay of time would be just the same, whichever of the two routes theymight elect to take. Think of it: a projected excursion of five hundredmiles gradually enlarged, without any elaborate degree of intention, to apossible twenty-four thousand. However, they were used to extensions bythis time, and did not mind this new one much.
And we had with us a lawyer from Victoria, who had been sent out by theGovernment on an international matter, and he had brought his wife withhim and left the children at home with the servants and now what was tobe done? Go ashore amongst the cholera and take the risks? Mostcertainly not. They decided to go on, to the Fiji islands, wait there afortnight for the next ship, and then sail for home. They couldn'tforesee that they wouldn't see a homeward-bound ship again for six weeks,and that no word could come to them from the children, and no word gofrom them to the children in all that time. It is easy to make plans inthis world; even a cat can do it; and when one is out in those remoteoceans it is noticeable that a cat's plans and a man's are worth aboutthe same. There is much the same shrinkage in both, in the matter ofvalues.
There was nothing for us to do but sit about the decks in the shade ofthe awnings and look at the distant shore. We lay in luminous bluewater; shoreward the water was green-green and brilliant; at the shoreitself it broke in a long white ruffle, and with no crash, no sound thatwe could hear. The town was buried under a mat of foliage that lookedlike a cushion of moss. The silky mountains were clothed in soft, richsplendors of melting color, and some of the cliffs were veiled inslanting mists. I recognized it all. It was just as I had seen it longbefore, with nothing of its beauty lost, nothing of its charm wanting.
A change had come, but that was political, and not visible from the ship.The monarchy of my day was gone, and a republic was sitting in its seat.It was not a material change. The old imitation pomps, the fuss andfeathers, have departed, and the royal trademark--that is about all thatone could miss, I suppose. That imitation monarchy, was grotesqueenough, in my time; if it had held on another thirty years it would havebeen a monarchy without subjects of the king's race.
We had a sunset of a very fine sort. The vast plain of the sea wasmarked off in bands of sharply-contrasted colors: great stretches of darkblue, others of purple, others of polished bronze; the billowy mountainsshowed all sorts of dainty browns and greens, blues and purples andblacks, and the rounded velvety backs of certain of them made one want tostroke them, as one would the sleek back of a cat. The long, slopingpromontory projecting into the sea at the west turned dim and leaden andspectral, then became suffused with pink--dissolved itself in a pinkdream, so to speak, it seemed so airy and unreal. Presently thecloud-rack was flooded with fiery splendors, and these were copied on thesurface of the sea, and it made one drunk with delight to look upon it.
From talks with certain of our passengers whose home was Honolulu, andfrom a sketch by Mrs. Mary H. Krout, I was able to perceive what theHonolulu of to-day is, as compared with the Honolulu of my time. In mytime it was a beautiful little town, made up of snow-white woodencottages deliciously smothered in tropical vines and flowers and treesand shrubs; and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth, and aswhite as the houses. The outside aspects of the place suggested thepresence of a modest and comfortable prosperity--a general prosperity--perhaps one might strengthen the term and say universal. There were nofine houses, no fine furniture. There were no decorations. Tallowcandles furnished the light for the bedrooms, a whale-oil lamp furnishedit for the parlor. Native matting served as carpeting. In the parlorone would find two or three lithographs on the walls--portraits as arule: Kamehameha IV., Louis Kossuth, Jenny Lind; and may be an engravingor two: Rebecca at the Well, Moses smiting the rock, Joseph's servantsfinding the cup in Benjamin's sack. There would be a center table, withbooks of a tranquil sort on it: The Whole Duty of Man, Baxter's Saints'Rest, Fox's Martyrs, Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, bound copies of TheMissionary Herald and of Father Damon's Seaman's Friend. A melodeon; amusic stand, with 'Willie, We have Missed You', 'Star of the Evening','Roll on Silver Moon', 'Are We Most There', 'I Would not Live Alway', andother songs of love and sentiment, together with an assortment of hymns.A what-not with semi-globular glass paperweights, enclosing miniaturepictures of ships, New England rural snowstorms, and the like; sea-shellswith Bible texts carved on them in cameo style; native curios; whale'stooth with full-rigged ship carved on it. There was nothing reminiscentof foreign parts, for nobody had been abroad. Trips were made to SanFrancisco, but that could not be called going abroad. Comprehensivelyspeaking, nobody traveled.
But Honolulu has grown wealthy since then, and of course wealth hasintroduced changes; some of the old simplicities have disappeared. Hereis a modern house, as pictured by Mrs. Krout:
 "Almost every house is surrounded by extensive lawns and gardens enclosed by walls of volcanic stone or by thick hedges of the brilliant hibiscus.
 "The houses are most tastefully and comfortably furnished; the floors are either of hard wood covered with rugs or with fine Indian matting, while there is a preference, as in most warm countries, for rattan or bamboo furniture; there are the usual accessories of bric-a-brac, pictures, books, and curios from all parts of the world, for these island dwellers are indefatigable travelers.
 "Nearly every house has what is called a lanai. It is a large apartment, roofed, floored, open on three sides, with a door or a draped archway opening into the drawing-room. Frequently the roof is formed by the thick interlacing boughs of the hou tree, impervious to the sun and even to the rain, except in violent storms. Vines are trained about the sides--the stephanotis or some one of the countless fragrant and blossoming trailers which abound in the islands. There are also curtains of matting that may be drawn to exclude the sun or rain. The floor is bare for coolness, or partially covered with rugs, and the lanai is prettily furnished with comfortable chairs, sofas, and tables loaded with flowers, or wonderful ferns in pots.
 "The lanai is the favorite reception room, and here at any social function the musical program is given and cakes and ices are served; here morning callers are received, or gay riding parties, the ladies in pretty divided skirts, worn for convenience in riding astride, --the universal mode adopted by Europeans and Americans, as well as by the natives.
 "The comfort and luxury of such an apartment, especially at a seashore villa, can hardly be imagined. The soft breezes sweep across it, heavy with the fragrance of jasmine and gardenia, and through the swaying boughs of palm and mimosa there are glimpses of rugged mountains, their summits veiled in clouds, of purple sea with the white surf beating eternally against the reefs, whiter still in the yellow sunlight or the magical moonlight of the tropics."
There: rugs, ices, pictures, lanais, worldly books, sinful bric-a-bracfetched from everywhere. And the ladies riding astride. These arechanges, indeed. In my time the native women rode astride, but the whiteones lacked the courage to adopt their wise custom. In my time ice wasseldom seen in Honolulu. It sometimes came in sailing vessels from NewEngland as ballast; and then, if there happened to be a man-of-war inport and balls and suppers raging by consequence, the ballast was worthsix hundred dollars a ton, as is evidenced by reputable tradition. Butthe ice-machine has traveled all over the world, now, and brought icewithin everybody's reach. In Lapland and Spitzbergen no one uses nativeice in our day, except the bears and the walruses.
The bicycle is not mentioned. It was not necessary. We know that it isthere, without inquiring. It is everywhere. But for it, people couldnever have had summer homes on the summit of Mont Blanc; before its day,property up there had but a nominal value. The ladies of the Hawaiiancapital learned too late the right way to occupy a horse--too late to getmuch benefit from it. The riding-horse is retiring from businesseverywhere in the world. In Honolulu a few years from now he will beonly a tradition.
We all know about Father Damien, the French priest who voluntarilyforsook the world and went to the leper island of Molokai to labor amongits population of sorrowful exiles who wait there, in slow-consumingmisery, for death to cone and release them from their troubles; and weknow that the thing which he knew beforehand would happen, did happen:that he became a leper himself, and died of that horrible disease. Therewas still another case of self-sacrifice, it appears. I asked after"Billy" Ragsdale, interpreter to the Parliament in my time--a half-white.He was a brilliant young fellow, and very popular. As an interpreter hewould have been hard to match anywhere. He used to stand up in theParliament and turn the English speeches into Hawaiian and the Hawaiianspeeches into English with a readiness and a volubility that wereastonishing. I asked after him, and was told that his prosperous careerwas cut short in a sudden and unexpected way, just as he was about tomarry a beautiful half-caste girl. He discovered, by some nearlyinvisible sign about his skin, that the poison of leprosy was in him.The secret was his own, and might be kept concealed for years; but hewould not be treacherous to the girl that loved him; he would not marryher to a doom like his. And so he put his affairs in order, and wentaround to all his friends and bade them good-bye, and sailed in the lepership to Molokai. There he died the loathsome and lingering death thatall lepers die.
In this place let me insert a paragraph or two from "The Paradise ofthe Pacific" (Rev. H. H. Gowen)--
 "Poor lepers! It is easy for those who have no relatives or friends among them to enforce the decree of segregation to the letter, but who can write of the terrible, the heart-breaking scenes which that enforcement has brought about?
 "A man upon Hawaii was suddenly taken away after a summary arrest, leaving behind him a helpless wife about to give birth to a babe. The devoted wife with great pain and risk came the whole journey to Honolulu, and pleaded until the authorities were unable to resist her entreaty that she might go and live like a leper with her leper husband.
 "A woman in the prime of life and activity is condemned as an incipient leper, suddenly removed from her home, and her husband returns to find his two helpless babes moaning for their lost mother.
 "Imagine it! The case of the babies is hard, but its bitterness is a trifle--less than a trifle--less than nothing--compared to what the mother must suffer; and suffer minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, month by month, year by year, without respite, relief, or any abatement of her pain till she dies.
 "One woman, Luka Kaaukau, has been living with her leper husband in the settlement for twelve years. The man has scarcely a joint left, his limbs are only distorted ulcerated stumps, for four years his wife has put every particle of food into his mouth. He wanted his wife to abandon his wretched carcass long ago, as she herself was sound and well, but Luka said that she was content to remain and wait on the man she loved till the spirit should be freed from its burden.
 "I myself have known hard cases enough:--of a girl, apparently in full health, decorating the church with me at Easter, who before Christmas is taken away as a confirmed leper; of a mother hiding her child in the mountains for years so that not even her dearest friends knew that she had a child alive, that he might not be taken away; of a respectable white man taken away from his wife and family, and compelled to become a dweller in the Leper Settlement, where he is counted dead, even by the insurance companies."
And one great pity of it all is, that these poor sufferers are innocent.The leprosy does not come of sins which they committed, but of sinscommitted by their ancestors, who escaped the curse of leprosy!
Mr. Gowan has made record of a certain very striking circumstance. Wouldyou expect to find in that awful Leper Settlement a custom worthy to betransplanted to your own country? They have one such, and it isinexpressibly touching and beautiful. When death sets open theprison-door of life there, the band salutes the freed soul with a burstof glad music!
