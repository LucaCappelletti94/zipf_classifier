The Heir of France is Crowned
IT WAS here hat we saw again the Grand Master of the King's Household, inwhose castle Joan was guest when she tarried at Chinon in those firstdays of her coming out of her own country. She made him Bailiff of Troyesnow by the King's permission.
And now we marched again; Chalons surrendered to us; and there by Chalonsin a talk, Joan, being asked if she had no fears for the future, saidyes, one--treachery. Who would believe it? who could dream it? And yet ina sense it was prophecy. Truly, man is a pitiful animal.
We marched, marched, kept on marching; and at last, on the 16th of July,we came in sight of our goal, and saw the great cathedraled towers ofRheims rise out of the distance! Huzza after huzza swept the army fromvan to rear; and as for Joan of Arc, there where she sat her horsegazing, clothed all in white armor, dreamy, beautiful, and in her face adeep, deep joy, a joy not of earth, oh, she was not flesh, she was aspirit! Her sublime mission was closing--closing in flawless triumph.To-morrow she could say, "It is finished--let me go free."
We camped, and the hurry and rush and turmoil of the grand preparationsbegan. The Archbishop and a great deputation arrived; and after thesecame flock after flock, crowd after crowd, of citizens and country-folk,hurrahing, in, with banners and music, and flowed over the camp, onerejoicing inundation after another, everybody drunk with happiness. Andall night long Rheims was hard at work, hammering away, decorating thetown, building triumphal arches and clothing the ancient cathedral withinand without in a glory of opulent splendors.
We moved betimes in the morning; the coronation ceremonies would begin atnine and last five hours. We were aware that the garrison of English andBurgundian soldiers had given up all thought of resisting the Maid, andthat we should find the gates standing hospitably open and the whole cityready to welcome us with enthusiasm.
It was a delicious morning, brilliant with sunshine, but cool and freshand inspiring. The army was in great form, and fine to see, as ituncoiled from its lair fold by fold, and stretched away on the finalmarch of the peaceful Coronation Campaign.
Joan, on her black horse, with the Lieutenant-General and the personalstaff grouped about her, took post for a final review and a good-by; forshe was not expecting to ever be a soldier again, or ever serve withthese or any other soldiers any more after this day. The army knew this,and believed it was looking for the last time upon the girlish face ofits invincible little Chief, its pet, its pride, its darling, whom it hadennobled in its private heart with nobilities of its own creation, callher "Daughter of God," "Savior of France," "Victory's Sweetheart," "ThePage of Christ," together with still softer titles which were simplynaive and frank endearments such as men are used to confer upon childrenwhom they love. And so one saw a new thing now; a thing bred of theemotion that was present there on both sides. Always before, in themarch-past, the battalions had gone swinging by in a storm of cheers,heads up and eyes flashing, the drums rolling, the bands braying pans ofvictory; but now there was nothing of that. But for one impressive sound,one could have closed his eyes and imagined himself in a world of thedead. That one sound was all that visited the ear in the summerstillness--just that one sound--the muffled tread of the marching host.As the serried masses drifted by, the men put their right hands up totheir temples, palms to the front, in military salute, turning their eyesupon Joan's face in mute God-bless-you and farewell, and keeping themthere while they could. They still kept their hands up in reverent salutemany steps after they had passed by. Every time Joan put her handkerchiefto her eyes you could see a little quiver of emotion crinkle along thefaces of the files.
The march-past after a victory is a thing to drive the heart mad withjubilation; but this one was a thing to break it.
We rode now to the King's lodgings, which was the Archbishop's countrypalace; and he was presently ready, and we galloped off and took positionat the head of the army. By this time the country-people were arriving inmultitudes from every direction and massing themselves on both sides ofthe road to get sight of Joan--just as had been done every day since ourfirst day's march began. Our march now lay through the grassy plain, andthose peasants made a dividing double border for that plain. Theystretched right down through it, a broad belt of bright colors on eachside of the road; for every peasant girl and woman in it had a whitejacket on her body and a crimson skirt on the rest of her. Endlessborders made of poppies and lilies stretching away in front of us--thatis what it looked like. And that is the kind of lane we had been marchingthrough all these days. Not a lane between multitudinous flowers standingupright on their stems--no, these flowers were always kneeling; kneeling,these human flowers, with their hands and faces lifted toward Joan ofArc, and the grateful tears streaming down. And all along, those closestto the road hugged her feet and kissed them and laid their wet cheeksfondly against them. I never, during all those days, saw any of eithersex stand while she passed, nor any man keep his head covered. Afterwardin the Great Trial these touching scenes were used as a weapon againsther. She had been made an object of adoration by the people, and this wasproof that she was a heretic--so claimed that unjust court.
As we drew near the city the curving long sweep of ramparts and towerswas gay with fluttering flags and black with masses of people; and allthe air was vibrant with the crash of artillery and gloomed with driftingclouds of smoke. We entered the gates in state and moved in processionthrough the city, with all the guilds and industries in holiday costumemarching in our rear with their banners; and all the route was hedgedwith a huzzaing crush of people, and all the windows were full and allthe roofs; and from the balconies hung costly stuffs of rich colors; andthe waving of handkerchiefs, seen in perspective through a long vista,was like a snowstorm.
Joan's name had been introduced into the prayers of the Church--an honortheretofore restricted to royalty. But she had a dearer honor and anhonor more to be proud of, from a humbler source: the common people hadhad leaden medals struck which bore her effigy and her escutcheon, andthese they wore as charms. One saw them everywhere.
From the Archbishop's Palace, where we halted, and where the King andJoan were to lodge, the King sent to the Abbey Church of St. Remi, whichwas over toward the gate by which we had entered the city, for the SainteAmpoule, or flask of holy oil. This oil was not earthly oil; it was madein heaven; the flask also. The flask, with the oil in it, was broughtdown from heaven by a dove. It was sent down to St. Remi just as he wasgoing to baptize King Clovis, who had become a Christian. I know this tobe true. I had known it long before; for Pere Fronte told me in Domremy.I cannot tell you how strange and awful it made me feel when I saw thatflask and knew I was looking with my own eyes upon a thing which hadactually been in heave, a thing which had been seen by angels, perhaps;and by God Himself of a certainty, for He sent it. And I was looking uponit--I. At one time I could have touched it. But I was afraid; for I couldnot know but that God had touched it. It is most probable that He had.
From this flask Clovis had been anointed; and from it all the kings ofFrance had been anointed since. Yes, ever since the time of Clovis, andthat was nine hundred years. And so, as I have said, that flask of holyoil was sent for, while we waited. A coronation without that would nothave been a coronation at all, in my belief.
Now in order to get the flask, a most ancient ceremonial had to be gonethrough with; otherwise the Abb of St. Remi, hereditary guardian inperpetuity of the oil, would not deliver it. So, in accordance withcustom, the King deputed five great nobles to ride in solemn state andrichly armed and accoutered, they and their steeds, to the Abbey Churchas a guard of honor to the Archbishop of Rheims and his canons, who wereto bear the King's demand for the oil. When the five great lords wereready to start, they knelt in a row and put up their mailed hands beforetheir faces, palm joined to palm, and swore upon their lives to conductthe sacred vessel safely, and safely restore it again to the Church ofSt. Remi after the anointing of the King. The Archbishop and hissubordinates, thus nobly escorted, took their way to St. Remi. TheArchbishop was in grand costume, with his miter on his head and his crossin his hand. At the door of St. Remi they halted and formed, to receivethe holy vial. Soon one heard the deep tones of the organ and of chantingmen; then one saw a long file of lights approaching through the dimchurch. And so came the Abbot, in his sacerdotal panoply, bearing thevial, with his people following after. He delivered it, with solemnceremonies, to the Archbishop; then the march back began, and it was mostimpressive; for it moved, the whole way, between two multitudes of menand women who lay flat upon their faces and prayed in dumb silence and indread while that awful thing went by that had been in heaven.
This August company arrived at the great west door of the cathedral; andas the Archbishop entered a noble anthem rose and filled the vastbuilding. The cathedral was packed with people--people in thousands. Onlya wide space down the center had been kept free. Down this space walkedthe Archbishop and his canons, and after them followed those five statelyfigures in splendid harness, each bearing his feudal banner--and riding!
Oh, that was a magnificent thing to see. Riding down the cavernousvastness of the building through the rich lights streaming in long raysfrom the pictured windows--oh, there was never anything so grand!
They rode clear to the choir--as much as four hundred feet from the door,it was said. Then the Archbishop dismissed them, and they made deepobeisance till their plumes touched their horses' necks, then made thoseproud prancing and mincing and dancing creatures go backward all the wayto the door--which was pretty to see, and graceful; then they stood themon their hind-feet and spun them around and plunged away and disappeared.
For some minutes there was a deep hush, a waiting pause; a silence soprofound that it was as if all those packed thousands there were steepedin dreamless slumber--why, you could even notice the faintest sounds,like the drowsy buzzing of insects; then came a mighty flood of richstrains from four hundred silver trumpets, and then, framed in thepointed archway of the great west door, appeared Joan and the King. Theyadvanced slowly, side by side, through a tempest of welcome--explosionafter explosion of cheers and cries, mingled with the deep thunders ofthe organ and rolling tides of triumphant song from chanting choirs.Behind Joan and the King came the Paladin and the Banner displayed; and amajestic figure he was, and most proud and lofty in his bearing, for heknew that the people were marking him and taking note of the gorgeousstate dress which covered his armor.
At his side was the Sire d'Albret, proxy for the Constable of France,bearing the Sword of State.
After these, in order of rank, came a body royally attired representingthe lay peers of France; it consisted of three princes of the blood, andLa Tremouille and the young De Laval brothers.
These were followed by the representatives of the ecclesiasticalpeers--the Archbishop of Rheims, and the Bishops of Laon, Chalons,Orleans, and one other.
Behind these came the Grand Staff, all our great generals and famousnames, and everybody was eager to get a sight of them. Through all thedin one could hear shouts all along that told you where two of them were:"Live the Bastard of Orleans!" "Satan La Hire forever!"
The August procession reached its appointed place in time, and thesolemnities of the Coronation began. They were long and imposing--withprayers, and anthems, and sermons, and everything that is right for suchoccasions; and Joan was at the King's side all these hours, with herStandard in her hand. But at last came the grand act: the King took theoath, he was anointed with the sacred oil; a splendid personage, followedby train-bearers and other attendants, approached, bearing the Crown ofFrance upon a cushion, and kneeling offered it. The King seemed tohesitate--in fact, did hesitate; for he put out his hand and then stoppedwith it there in the air over the crown, the fingers in the attitude oftaking hold of it. But that was for only a moment--though a moment is anotable something when it stops the heartbeat of twenty thousand peopleand makes them catch their breath. Yes, only a moment; then he caughtJoan's eye, and she gave him a look with all the joy of her thankfulgreat soul in it; then he smiled, and took the Crown of France in hishand, and right finely and right royally lifted it up and set it upon hishead.
Then what a crash there was! All about us cries and cheers, and thechanting of the choirs and groaning of the organ; and outside theclamoring of the bells and the booming of the cannon. The fantasticdream, the incredible dream, the impossible dream of the peasant-childstood fulfilled; the English power was broken, the Heir of France wascrowned.
She was like one transfigured, so divine was the joy that shone in herface as she sank to her knees at the King's feet and looked up at himthrough her tears. Her lips were quivering, and her words came soft andlow and broken:
"Now, O gentle King, is the pleasure of God accomplished according to Hiscommand that you should come to Rheims and receive the crown thatbelongeth of right to you, and unto none other. My work which was givenme to do is finished; give me your peace, and let me go back to mymother, who is poor and old, and has need of me."
The King raised her up, and there before all that host he praised hergreat deeds in most noble terms; and there he confirmed her nobility andtitles, making her the equal of a count in rank, and also appointed ahousehold and officers for her according to her dignity; and then hesaid:
"You have saved the crown. Speak--require--demand; and whatsoever graceyou ask it shall be granted, though it make the kingdom poor to meet it."
Now that was fine, that was royal. Joan was on her knees againstraightway, and said:
"Then, O gentle King, if out of your compassion you will speak the word,I pray you give commandment that my village, poor and hard pressed byreason of war, may have its taxes remitted."
"It is so commanded. Say on."
"That is all."
"All? Nothing but that?"
"It is all. I have no other desire."
"But that is nothing--less than nothing. Ask--do not be afraid."
"Indeed, I cannot, gentle King. Do not press me. I will not have aughtelse, but only this alone."
The King seemed nonplussed, and stood still a moment, as if trying tocomprehend and realize the full stature of this strange unselfishness.Then he raised his head and said:
"Who has won a kingdom and crowned its King; and all she asks and all shewill take is this poor grace--and even this is for others, not forherself. And it is well; her act being proportioned to the dignity of onewho carries in her head and heart riches which outvalue any that any Kingcould add, though he gave his all. She shall have her way. Now,therefore, it is decreed that from this day forth Domremy, natal villageof Joan of Arc, Deliverer of France, called the Maid of Orleans, is freedfrom all taxation forever." Whereat the silver horns blew a jubilantblast.
There, you see, she had had a vision of this very scene the time she wasin a trance in the pastures of Domremy and we asked her to name to boonshe would demand of the King if he should ever chance to tell her shemight claim one. But whether she had the vision or not, this act showedthat after all the dizzy grandeurs that had come upon her, she was stillthe same simple, unselfish creature that she was that day.
Yes, Charles VII. remitted those taxes "forever." Often the gratitude ofkings and nations fades and their promises are forgotten or deliberatelyviolated; but you, who are children of France, should remember with pridethat France has kept this one faithfully. Sixty-three years have gone bysince that day. The taxes of the region wherein Domremy lies have beencollected sixty-three times since then, and all the villages of thatregion have paid except that one--Domremy. The tax-gatherer never visitsDomremy. Domremy has long ago forgotten what that dread sorrow-sowingapparition is like. Sixty-three tax-books have been filed meantime, andthey lie yonder with the other public records, and any may see them thatdesire it. At the top of every page in the sixty-three books stands thename of a village, and below that name its weary burden of taxation isfigured out and displayed; in the case of all save one. It is true, justas I tell you. In each of the sixty-three books there is a page headed"Domremi," but under that name not a figure appears. Where the figuresshould be, there are three words written; and the same words have beenwritten every year for all these years; yes, it is a blank page, withalways those grateful words lettered across the face of it--a touchingmemorial. Thus:
__________________________________ | | | DOMREMI | | | |

"NOTHING--THE MAID OF ORLEANS."
How brief it is; yet how much it says! It is the nation speaking. Youhave the spectacle of that unsentimental thing, a Government, makingreverence to that name and saying to its agent, "Uncover, and pass on; itis France that commands." Yes, the promise has been kept; it will be keptalways; "forever" was the King's word. [1] At two o'clock in theafternoon the ceremonies of the Coronation came at last to an end; thenthe procession formed once more, with Joan and the King at its head, andtook up its solemn march through the midst of the church, all instrumentsand all people making such clamor of rejoicing noises as was, indeed, amarvel to hear. An so ended the third of the great days of Joan's life.And how close together they stand--May 8th, June 18th, July 17th!
[1] IT was faithfully kept during three hundred and sixty years and more;then the over-confident octogenarian's prophecy failed. During the tumultof the French Revolution the promise was forgotten and the gracewithdrawn. It has remained in disuse ever since. Joan never asked to beremembered, but France has remembered her with an inextinguishable loveand reverence; Joan never asked for a statue, but France has lavishedthem upon her; Joan never asked for a church for Domremy, but France isbuilding one; Joan never asked for saintship, but even that is impending.Everything which Joan of Arc did not ask for has been given her, and witha noble profusion; but the one humble little thing which she did ask forand get has been taken away from her. There is something infinitelypathetic about this. France owes Domremy a hundred years of taxes, andcould hardly find a citizen within her borders who would vote against thepayment of the debt. -- NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR.
