Nay, Lord, not thus! white lilies in the spring,Sad olive-groves, or silver-breasted dove,Teach me more clearly of Thy life and loveThan terrors of red flame and thundering.The hillside vines dear memories of Thee bring:A bird at evening flying to its nestTells me of One who had no place of rest:I think it is of Thee the sparrows sing.Come rather on some autumn afternoon,When red and brown are burnished on the leaves,And the fields echo to the gleaner's song,Come when the splendid fulness of the moonLooks down upon the rows of golden sheaves,And reap Thy harvest: we have waited long.
