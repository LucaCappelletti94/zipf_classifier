  When you went, how was it you carried with you	My missal book of fine, flamboyant hours?	My book of turrets and of red-thorn bowers,	And skies of gold, and ladies in bright tissue?	 Now underneath a blue-grey twilight, heaped Beyond the withering snow of the shorn fields	Stands rubble of stunted houses; all is reaped	And garnered that the golden daylight yields.	 Dim lamps like yellow poppies glimmer among	The shadowy stubble of the under-dusk, As farther off the scythe of night is swung,	And little stars come rolling from their husk.	 And all the earth is gone into a dust	Of greyness mingled with a fume of gold,	Covered with aged lichens, past with must, And all the sky has withered and gone cold.	 And so I sit and scan the book of grey,	Feeling the shadows like a blind man reading,	All fearful lest I find the last words bleeding	With wounds of sunset and the dying day.
