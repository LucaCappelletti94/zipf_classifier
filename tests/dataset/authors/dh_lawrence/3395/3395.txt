From Amores, (1916).
  See the stars, love,	In the water much clearer and brighter	Than those above us, and whiter,	Like nenuphars.	 Star-shadows shine, love, How many stars in your bowl?	How many shadows in your soul,	Only mine, love, mine?	 When I move the oars, love,	See how the stars are tossed, Distorted, the brightest lost.	So that bright one of yours, love.	 The poor waters spill	The stars, waters broken, forsaken.	The heavens are not shaken, you say, love, Its stars stand still.	 There, did you see	That spark fly up at us; even	Stars are not safe in heaven.	What of yours, then, love, yours?  What then, love, if soon	Your light be tossed over a wave?	Will you count the darkness a grave,	And swoon, love, swoon?
