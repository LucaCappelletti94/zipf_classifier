The last twenty-four hours we staid in Damascus I lay prostrate with aviolent attack of cholera, or cholera morbus, and therefore had a goodchance and a good excuse to lie there on that wide divan and take anhonest rest. I had nothing to do but listen to the pattering of thefountains and take medicine and throw it up again. It was dangerousrecreation, but it was pleasanter than traveling in Syria. I had plentyof snow from Mount Hermon, and as it would not stay on my stomach, therewas nothing to interfere with my eating it--there was always room formore. I enjoyed myself very well. Syrian travel has its interestingfeatures, like travel in any other part of the world, and yet to breakyour leg or have the cholera adds a welcome variety to it.
We left Damascus at noon and rode across the plain a couple of hours, andthen the party stopped a while in the shade of some fig-trees to give mea chance to rest. It was the hottest day we had seen yet--the sun-flamesshot down like the shafts of fire that stream out before a blow-pipe--therays seemed to fall in a steady deluge on the head and pass downward likerain from a roof. I imagined I could distinguish between the floods ofrays--I thought I could tell when each flood struck my head, when itreached my shoulders, and when the next one came. It was terrible. Allthe desert glared so fiercely that my eyes were swimming in tears all thetime. The boys had white umbrellas heavily lined with dark green. Theywere a priceless blessing. I thanked fortune that I had one, too,notwithstanding it was packed up with the baggage and was ten milesahead. It is madness to travel in Syria without an umbrella. They toldme in Beirout (these people who always gorge you with advice) that it wasmadness to travel in Syria without an umbrella. It was on this accountthat I got one.
But, honestly, I think an umbrella is a nuisance any where when itsbusiness is to keep the sun off. No Arab wears a brim to his fez, oruses an umbrella, or any thing to shade his eyes or his face, and healways looks comfortable and proper in the sun. But of all theridiculous sights I ever have seen, our party of eight is the most so--they do cut such an outlandish figure. They travel single file; they allwear the endless white rag of Constantinople wrapped round and roundtheir hats and dangling down their backs; they all wear thick greenspectacles, with side-glasses to them; they all hold white umbrellas,lined with green, over their heads; without exception their stirrups aretoo short--they are the very worst gang of horsemen on earth, theiranimals to a horse trot fearfully hard--and when they get strung out oneafter the other; glaring straight ahead and breathless; bouncing high andout of turn, all along the line; knees well up and stiff, elbows flappinglike a rooster's that is going to crow, and the long file of umbrellaspopping convulsively up and down--when one sees this outrageous pictureexposed to the light of day, he is amazed that the gods don't get outtheir thunderbolts and destroy them off the face of the earth! I do--Iwonder at it. I wouldn't let any such caravan go through a country ofmine.
And when the sun drops below the horizon and the boys close theirumbrellas and put them under their arms, it is only a variation of thepicture, not a modification of its absurdity.
But may be you can not see the wild extravagance of my panorama. Youcould if you were here. Here, you feel all the time just as if you wereliving about the year 1200 before Christ--or back to the patriarchs--orforward to the New Era. The scenery of the Bible is about you--thecustoms of the patriarchs are around you--the same people, in the sameflowing robes, and in sandals, cross your path--the same long trains ofstately camels go and come--the same impressive religious solemnity andsilence rest upon the desert and the mountains that were upon them in theremote ages of antiquity, and behold, intruding upon a scene like this,comes this fantastic mob of green-spectacled Yanks, with their flappingelbows and bobbing umbrellas! It is Daniel in the lion's den with agreen cotton umbrella under his arm, all over again.
My umbrella is with the baggage, and so are my green spectacles--andthere they shall stay. I will not use them. I will show some respectfor the eternal fitness of things. It will be bad enough to getsun-struck, without looking ridiculous into the bargain. If I fall,let me fall bearing about me the semblance of a Christian, at least.
Three or four hours out from Damascus we passed the spot where Saul wasso abruptly converted, and from this place we looked back over thescorching desert, and had our last glimpse of beautiful Damascus, deckedin its robes of shining green. After nightfall we reached our tents,just outside of the nasty Arab village of Jonesborough. Of course thereal name of the place is El something or other, but the boys stillrefuse to recognize the Arab names or try to pronounce them. When I saythat that village is of the usual style, I mean to insinuate that allSyrian villages within fifty miles of Damascus are alike--so much alikethat it would require more than human intelligence to tell wherein onediffered from another. A Syrian village is a hive of huts one story high(the height of a man,) and as square as a dry-goods box; it ismud-plastered all over, flat roof and all, and generally whitewashedafter a fashion. The same roof often extends over half the town,covering many of the streets, which are generally about a yard wide.When you ride through one of these villages at noon-day, you first meeta melancholy dog, that looks up at you and silently begs that you won'trun over him, but he does not offer to get out of the way; next you meeta young boy without any clothes on, and he holds out his hand and says"Bucksheesh!"--he don't really expect a cent, but then he learned tosay that before he learned to say mother, and now he can not breakhimself of it; next you meet a woman with a black veil drawn closelyover her face, and her bust exposed; finally, you come to severalsore-eyed children and children in all stages of mutilation and decay;and sitting humbly in the dust, and all fringed with filthy rags, is apoor devil whose arms and legs are gnarled and twisted like grape-vines.These are all the people you are likely to see. The balance of thepopulation are asleep within doors, or abroad tending goats in theplains and on the hill-sides. The village is built on some consumptivelittle water-course, and about it is a little fresh-looking vegetation.Beyond this charmed circle, for miles on every side, stretches a wearydesert of sand and gravel, which produces a gray bunchy shrub likesage-brush. A Syrian village is the sorriest sight in the world, andits surroundings are eminently in keeping with it.
I would not have gone into this dissertation upon Syrian villages but forthe fact that Nimrod, the Mighty Hunter of Scriptural notoriety, isburied in Jonesborough, and I wished the public to know about how he islocated. Like Homer, he is said to be buried in many other places, butthis is the only true and genuine place his ashes inhabit.
When the original tribes were dispersed, more than four thousand yearsago, Nimrod and a large party traveled three or four hundred miles, andsettled where the great city of Babylon afterwards stood. Nimrod builtthat city. He also began to build the famous Tower of Babel, butcircumstances over which he had no control put it out of his power tofinish it. He ran it up eight stories high, however, and two of themstill stand, at this day--a colossal mass of brickwork, rent down thecentre by earthquakes, and seared and vitrified by the lightnings of anangry God. But the vast ruin will still stand for ages, to shame thepuny labors of these modern generations of men. Its huge compartmentsare tenanted by owls and lions, and old Nimrod lies neglected in thiswretched village, far from the scene of his grand enterprise.
We left Jonesborough very early in the morning, and rode forever andforever and forever, it seemed to me, over parched deserts and rockyhills, hungry, and with no water to drink. We had drained the goat-skinsdry in a little while. At noon we halted before the wretched Arab townof El Yuba Dam, perched on the side of a mountain, but the dragoman saidif we applied there for water we would be attacked by the whole tribe,for they did not love Christians. We had to journey on. Two hours laterwe reached the foot of a tall isolated mountain, which is crowned by thecrumbling castle of Banias, the stateliest ruin of that kind on earth, nodoubt. It is a thousand feet long and two hundred wide, all of the mostsymmetrical, and at the same time the most ponderous masonry. Themassive towers and bastions are more than thirty feet high, and have beensixty. From the mountain's peak its broken turrets rise above the grovesof ancient oaks and olives, and look wonderfully picturesque. It is ofsuch high antiquity that no man knows who built it or when it was built.It is utterly inaccessible, except in one place, where a bridle-pathwinds upward among the solid rocks to the old portcullis. The horses'hoofs have bored holes in these rocks to the depth of six inches duringthe hundreds and hundreds of years that the castle was garrisoned. Wewandered for three hours among the chambers and crypts and dungeons ofthe fortress, and trod where the mailed heels of many a knightly Crusaderhad rang, and where Phenician heroes had walked ages before them.
We wondered how such a solid mass of masonry could be affected even by anearthquake, and could not understand what agency had made Banias a ruin;but we found the destroyer, after a while, and then our wonder wasincreased tenfold. Seeds had fallen in crevices in the vast walls; theseeds had sprouted; the tender, insignificant sprouts had hardened; theygrew larger and larger, and by a steady, imperceptible pressure forcedthe great stones apart, and now are bringing sure destruction upon agiant work that has even mocked the earthquakes to scorn! Gnarled andtwisted trees spring from the old walls every where, and beautify andovershadow the gray battlements with a wild luxuriance of foliage.
From these old towers we looked down upon a broad, far-reaching greenplain, glittering with the pools and rivulets which are the sources ofthe sacred river Jordan. It was a grateful vision, after so much desert.
And as the evening drew near, we clambered down the mountain, throughgroves of the Biblical oaks of Bashan, (for we were just stepping overthe border and entering the long-sought Holy Land,) and at its extremefoot, toward the wide valley, we entered this little execrable village ofBanias and camped in a great grove of olive trees near a torrent ofsparkling water whose banks are arrayed in fig-trees, pomegranates andoleanders in full leaf. Barring the proximity of the village, it is asort of paradise.
The very first thing one feels like doing when he gets into camp, allburning up and dusty, is to hunt up a bath. We followed the stream up towhere it gushes out of the mountain side, three hundred yards from thetents, and took a bath that was so icy that if I did not know this wasthe main source of the sacred river, I would expect harm to come of it.It was bathing at noonday in the chilly source of the Abana, "River ofDamascus," that gave me the cholera, so Dr. B. said. However, itgenerally does give me the cholera to take a bath.
The incorrigible pilgrims have come in with their pockets full ofspecimens broken from the ruins. I wish this vandalism could be stopped.They broke off fragments from Noah's tomb; from the exquisite sculpturesof the temples of Baalbec; from the houses of Judas and Ananias, inDamascus; from the tomb of Nimrod the Mighty Hunter in Jonesborough; fromthe worn Greek and Roman inscriptions set in the hoary walls of theCastle of Banias; and now they have been hacking and chipping these oldarches here that Jesus looked upon in the flesh. Heaven protect theSepulchre when this tribe invades Jerusalem!
The ruins here are not very interesting. There are the massive walls ofa great square building that was once the citadel; there are manyponderous old arches that are so smothered with debris that they barelyproject above the ground; there are heavy-walled sewers through which thecrystal brook of which Jordan is born still runs; in the hill-side arethe substructions of a costly marble temple that Herod the Great builthere--patches of its handsome mosaic floors still remain; there is aquaint old stone bridge that was here before Herod's time, may be;scattered every where, in the paths and in the woods, are Corinthiancapitals, broken porphyry pillars, and little fragments of sculpture; andup yonder in the precipice where the fountain gushes out, are well-wornGreek inscriptions over niches in the rock where in ancient times theGreeks, and after them the Romans, worshipped the sylvan god Pan. Buttrees and bushes grow above many of these ruins now; the miserable hutsof a little crew of filthy Arabs are perched upon the broken masonry ofantiquity, the whole place has a sleepy, stupid, rural look about it, andone can hardly bring himself to believe that a busy, substantially builtcity once existed here, even two thousand years ago. The place wasnevertheless the scene of an event whose effects have added page afterpage and volume after volume to the world's history. For in this placeChrist stood when he said to Peter:
 "Thou art Peter; and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
On those little sentences have been built up the mighty edifice of theChurch of Rome; in them lie the authority for the imperial power of thePopes over temporal affairs, and their godlike power to curse a soul orwash it white from sin. To sustain the position of "the only trueChurch," which Rome claims was thus conferred upon her, she has foughtand labored and struggled for many a century, and will continue to keepherself busy in the same work to the end of time. The memorable words Ihave quoted give to this ruined city about all the interest it possessesto people of the present day.
It seems curious enough to us to be standing on ground that was onceactually pressed by the feet of the Saviour. The situation is suggestiveof a reality and a tangibility that seem at variance with the vaguenessand mystery and ghostliness that one naturally attaches to the characterof a god. I can not comprehend yet that I am sitting where a god hasstood, and looking upon the brook and the mountains which that god lookedupon, and am surrounded by dusky men and women whose ancestors saw him,and even talked with him, face to face, and carelessly, just as theywould have done with any other stranger. I can not comprehend this; thegods of my understanding have been always hidden in clouds and very faraway.
This morning, during breakfast, the usual assemblage of squalid humanitysat patiently without the charmed circle of the camp and waited for suchcrumbs as pity might bestow upon their misery. There were old and young,brown-skinned and yellow. Some of the men were tall and stalwart, (forone hardly sees any where such splendid-looking men as here in the East,)but all the women and children looked worn and sad, and distressed withhunger. They reminded me much of Indians, did these people. They hadbut little clothing, but such as they had was fanciful in character andfantastic in its arrangement. Any little absurd gewgaw or gimcrack theyhad they disposed in such a way as to make it attract attention mostreadily. They sat in silence, and with tireless patience watched ourevery motion with that vile, uncomplaining impoliteness which is so trulyIndian, and which makes a white man so nervous and uncomfortable andsavage that he wants to exterminate the whole tribe.
These people about us had other peculiarities, which I have noticed inthe noble red man, too: they were infested with vermin, and the dirt hadcaked on them till it amounted to bark.
The little children were in a pitiable condition--they all had sore eyes,and were otherwise afflicted in various ways. They say that hardly anative child in all the East is free from sore eyes, and that thousandsof them go blind of one eye or both every year. I think this must be so,for I see plenty of blind people every day, and I do not remember seeingany children that hadn't sore eyes. And, would you suppose that anAmerican mother could sit for an hour, with her child in her arms, andlet a hundred flies roost upon its eyes all that time undisturbed? I seethat every day. It makes my flesh creep. Yesterday we met a womanriding on a little jackass, and she had a little child in her arms--honestly, I thought the child had goggles on as we approached, and Iwondered how its mother could afford so much style. But when we drewnear, we saw that the goggles were nothing but a camp meeting of fliesassembled around each of the child's eyes, and at the same time there wasa detachment prospecting its nose. The flies were happy, the child wascontented, and so the mother did not interfere.
As soon as the tribe found out that we had a doctor in our party, theybegan to flock in from all quarters. Dr. B., in the charity of hisnature, had taken a child from a woman who sat near by, and put some sortof a wash upon its diseased eyes. That woman went off and started thewhole nation, and it was a sight to see them swarm! The lame, the halt,the blind, the leprous--all the distempers that are bred of indolence,dirt, and iniquity--were represented in the Congress in ten minutes, andstill they came! Every woman that had a sick baby brought it along, andevery woman that hadn't, borrowed one. What reverent and what worshipinglooks they bent upon that dread, mysterious power, the Doctor! Theywatched him take his phials out; they watched him measure the particlesof white powder; they watched him add drops of one precious liquid, anddrops of another; they lost not the slightest movement; their eyes wereriveted upon him with a fascination that nothing could distract.I believe they thought he was gifted like a god. When each individualgot his portion of medicine, his eyes were radiant with joy--notwithstanding by nature they are a thankless and impassive race--andupon his face was written the unquestioning faith that nothing on earthcould prevent the patient from getting well now.
Christ knew how to preach to these simple, superstitious,disease-tortured creatures: He healed the sick. They flocked to ourpoor human doctor this morning when the fame of what he had done to thesick child went abroad in the land, and they worshiped him with theireyes while they did not know as yet whether there was virtue in hissimples or not. The ancestors of these--people precisely like them incolor, dress, manners, customs, simplicity--flocked in vast multitudesafter Christ, and when they saw Him make the afflicted whole with aword, it is no wonder they worshiped Him. No wonder His deeds were thetalk of the nation. No wonder the multitude that followed Him was sogreat that at one time--thirty miles from here--they had to let a sickman down through the roof because no approach could be made to the door;no wonder His audiences were so great at Galilee that He had to preachfrom a ship removed a little distance from the shore; no wonder thateven in the desert places about Bethsaida, five thousand invaded Hissolitude, and He had to feed them by a miracle or else see them sufferfor their confiding faith and devotion; no wonder when there was a greatcommotion in a city in those days, one neighbor explained it to anotherin words to this effect: "They say that Jesus of Nazareth is come!"
Well, as I was saying, the doctor distributed medicine as long as he hadany to distribute, and his reputation is mighty in Galilee this day.Among his patients was the child of the Shiek's daughter--for even thispoor, ragged handful of sores and sin has its royal Shiek--a poor oldmummy that looked as if he would be more at home in a poor-house than inthe Chief Magistracy of this tribe of hopeless, shirtless savages. Theprincess--I mean the Shiek's daughter--was only thirteen or fourteenyears old, and had a very sweet face and a pretty one. She was the onlySyrian female we have seen yet who was not so sinfully ugly that shecouldn't smile after ten o'clock Saturday night without breaking theSabbath. Her child was a hard specimen, though--there wasn't enough ofit to make a pie, and the poor little thing looked so pleadingly up atall who came near it (as if it had an idea that now was its chance ornever,) that we were filled with compassion which was genuine and not puton.
But this last new horse I have got is trying to break his neck over thetent-ropes, and I shall have to go out and anchor him. Jericho and Ihave parted company. The new horse is not much to boast of, I think.One of his hind legs bends the wrong way, and the other one is asstraight and stiff as a tent-pole. Most of his teeth are gone, and he isas blind as bat. His nose has been broken at some time or other, and isarched like a culvert now. His under lip hangs down like a camel's, andhis ears are chopped off close to his head. I had some trouble at firstto find a name for him, but I finally concluded to call him Baalbec,because he is such a magnificent ruin. I can not keep from talking aboutmy horses, because I have a very long and tedious journey before me, andthey naturally occupy my thoughts about as much as matters of apparentlymuch greater importance.
We satisfied our pilgrims by making those hard rides from Baalbec toDamascus, but Dan's horse and Jack's were so crippled we had to leavethem behind and get fresh animals for them. The dragoman says Jack'shorse died. I swapped horses with Mohammed, the kingly-looking Egyptianwho is our Ferguson's lieutenant. By Ferguson I mean our dragomanAbraham, of course. I did not take this horse on account of his personalappearance, but because I have not seen his back. I do not wish to seeit. I have seen the backs of all the other horses, and found most ofthem covered with dreadful saddle-boils which I know have not been washedor doctored for years. The idea of riding all day long over such ghastlyinquisitions of torture is sickening. My horse must be like the others,but I have at least the consolation of not knowing it to be so.
I hope that in future I may be spared any more sentimental praises of theArab's idolatry of his horse. In boyhood I longed to be an Arab of thedesert and have a beautiful mare, and call her Selim or Benjamin orMohammed, and feed her with my own hands, and let her come into the tent,and teach her to caress me and look fondly upon me with her great tendereyes; and I wished that a stranger might come at such a time and offer mea hundred thousand dollars for her, so that I could do like the otherArabs--hesitate, yearn for the money, but overcome by my love for mymare, at last say, "Part with thee, my beautiful one! Never with mylife! Away, tempter, I scorn thy gold!" and then bound into the saddleand speed over the desert like the wind!
But I recall those aspirations. If these Arabs be like the other Arabs,their love for their beautiful mares is a fraud. These of myacquaintance have no love for their horses, no sentiment of pity forthem, and no knowledge of how to treat them or care for them. The Syriansaddle-blanket is a quilted mattress two or three inches thick. It isnever removed from the horse, day or night. It gets full of dirt andhair, and becomes soaked with sweat. It is bound to breed sores. Thesepirates never think of washing a horse's back. They do not shelter thehorses in the tents, either--they must stay out and take the weather asit comes. Look at poor cropped and dilapidated "Baalbec," and weep forthe sentiment that has been wasted upon the Selims of romance!
