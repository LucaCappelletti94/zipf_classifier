"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger runSOUTH?"
No, they allowed he wouldn't. I had to accountfor things some way, so I says:
"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri,where I was born, and they all died off but me and paand my brother Ike. Pa, he 'lowed he'd break upand go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got alittle one-horse place on the river, forty-four milebelow Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had somedebts; so when he'd squared up there warn't nothingleft but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. Thatwarn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deckpassage nor no other way. Well, when the river rosepa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this pieceof a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans onit. Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run overthe forrard corner of the raft one night, and we allwent overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim andme come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike wasonly four years old, so they never come up no more.Well, for the next day or two we had considerabletrouble, because people was always coming out in skiffsand trying to take Jim away from me, saying they be-lieved he was a runaway nigger. We don't run day-times no more now; nights they don't bother us."
The duke says:
"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can runin the daytime if we want to. I'll think the thingover -- I'll invent a plan that'll fix it. We'll let italone for to-day, because of course we don't want togo by that town yonder in daylight -- it mightn't behealthy."
Towards night it begun to darken up and look likerain; the heat lightning was squirting around low downin the sky, and the leaves was beginning to shiver -- itwas going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that.So the duke and the king went to overhauling ourwigwam, to see what the beds was like. My bed wasa straw tickQbetter than Jim's, which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in ashuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; andwhen you roll over the dry shucks sound like you wasrolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such arustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed hewould take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.He says:
"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would asejested to you that a corn-shuck bed warn't just fittenfor me to sleep on. Your Grace 'll take the shuckbed yourself."
Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, beingafraid there was going to be some more troubleamongst them; so we was pretty glad when the dukesays:
"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mireunder the iron heel of oppression. Misfortune hasbroken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I submit; 'tismy fate. I am alone in the world -- let me suffer;can bear it."
We got away as soon as it was good and dark. Theking told us to stand well out towards the middle ofthe river, and not show a light till we got a long waysbelow the town. We come in sight of the little bunchof lights by and by -- that was the town, you know --and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. Whenwe was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted upour signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come onto rain and blow and thunder and lighten like every-thing; so the king told us to both stay on watch tillthe weather got better; then him and the duke crawledinto the wigwam and turned in for the night. It wasmy watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned inanyway if I'd had a bed, because a body don't seesuch a storm as that every day in the week, not by along sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along!And every second or two there'd come a glare that litup the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'dsee the islands looking dusty through the rain, and thetrees thrashing around in the wind; then comes aH-WHACK! -- bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the thunder would go rumbling andgrumbling away, and quit -- and then RIP comes an-other flash and another sockdolager. The waves mostwashed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't anyclothes on, and didn't mind. We didn't have notrouble about snags; the lightning was glaring andflittering around so constant that we could see themplenty soon enough to throw her head this way or thatand miss them.
I had the middle watch, you know, but I was prettysleepy by that time, so Jim he said he would stand thefirst half of it for me; he was always mighty goodthat way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, butthe king and the duke had their legs sprawled aroundso there warn't no show for me; so I laid outside -- Ididn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and thewaves warn't running so high now. About two theycome up again, though, and Jim was going to call me;but he changed his mind, because he reckoned theywarn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he wasmistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a suddenalong comes a regular ripper and washed me over-board. It most killed Jim a-laughing. He was theeasiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.
I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snoredaway; and by and by the storm let up for good andall; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted himout, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for theday.
The king got out an old ratty deck of cards afterbreakfast, and him and the duke played seven-up awhile, five cents a game. Then they got tired of it,and allowed they would "lay out a campaign," asthey called it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills andread them out loud. One bill said, "The celebratedDr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris," would "lectureon the Science of Phrenology" at such and such aplace, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admis-sion, and "furnish charts of character at twenty-fivecents apiece." The duke said that was HIM. In an-other bill he was the "world-renowned Shakespeariantragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, Lon-don." In other bills he had a lot of other names anddone other wonderful things, like finding water andgold with a "divining-rod," "dissipating witchspells," and so on. By and by he says:
"But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have youever trod the boards, Royalty?"
"No," says the king.
"You shall, then, before you're three days older,Fallen Grandeur," says the duke. "The first goodtown we come to we'll hire a hall and do the swordfight in Richard III. and the balcony scene in Romeoand Juliet. How does that strike you?"
"I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay,Bilgewater; but, you see, I don't know nothing aboutplay-actin', and hain't ever seen much of it. I was toosmall when pap used to have 'em at the palace. Doyou reckon you can learn me?"
"Easy!"
"All right. I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh,anyway. Le's commence right away."
So the duke he told him all about who Romeo wasand who Juliet was, and said he was used to beingRomeo, so the king could be Juliet.
"But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeledhead and my white whiskers is goin' to look oncommonodd on her, maybe."
"No, don't you worry; these country jakes won'tever think of that. Besides, you know, you'll be incostume, and that makes all the difference in theworld; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlightbefore she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumesfor the parts."
He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, whichhe said was meedyevil armor for Richard III. andt'other chap, and a long white cotton nightshirt and aruffled nightcap to match. The king was satisfied; sothe duke got out his book and read the parts over inthe most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing aroundand acting at the same time, to show how it had got tobe done; then he give the book to the king and toldhim to get his part by heart.
There was a little one-horse town about three miledown the bend, and after dinner the duke said he hadciphered out his idea about how to run in daylightwithout it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowedhe would go down to the town and fix that thing.The king allowed he would go, too, and see if hecouldn't strike something. We was out of coffee, soJim said I better go along with them in the canoe andget some.
When we got there there warn't nobody stirring;streets empty, and perfectly dead and still, like Sun-day. We found a sick nigger sunning himself in aback yard, and he said everybody that warn't tooyoung or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the woods. The kinggot the directions, and allowed he'd go and work thatcamp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go,too.
The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it; a little bit of a concern, up overa carpenter shop -- carpenters and printers all gone tothe meeting, and no doors locked. It was a dirty,littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbillswith pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them,all over the walls. The duke shed his coat and said hewas all right now. So me and the king lit out for thecamp-meeting.
We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping,for it was a most awful hot day. There was as muchas a thousand people there from twenty mile around.The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitchedeverywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs andstomping to keep off the flies. There was sheds madeout of poles and roofed over with branches, where theyhad lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles ofwatermelons and green corn and such-like truck.
The preaching was going on under the same kindsof sheds, only they was bigger and held crowds ofpeople. The benches was made out of outside slabsof logs, with holes bored in the round side to drivesticks into for legs. They didn't have no backs.The preachers had high platforms to stand on at oneend of the sheds. The women had on sun-bonnets;and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some ginghamones, and a few of the young ones had on calico.Some of the young men was barefooted, and some ofthe children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, andsome of the young folks was courting on the sly.
The first shed we come to the preacher was liningout a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sungit, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was somany of them and they done it in such a rousing way;then he lined out two more for them to sing -- and soon. The people woke up more and more, and sunglouder and louder; and towards the end some begunto groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacherbegun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and wentweaving first to one side of the platform and then theother, and then a-leaning down over the front of it,with his arms and his body going all the time, andshouting his words out with all his might; and everynow and then he would hold up his Bible and spread itopen, and kind of pass it around this way and that,shouting, "It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!Look upon it and live!" And people would shoutout, "Glory! -- A-a-MEN!" And so he went on, andthe people groaning and crying and saying amen:
"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, blackwith sin! (AMEN!) come, sick and sore! (AMEN!)come, lame and halt and blind! (AMEN!) come, poreand needy, sunk in shame! (A-A-MEN!) come, allthat's worn and soiled and suffering! -- come with abroken spirit! come with a contrite heart! come inyour rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse isfree, the door of heaven stands open -- oh, enter inand be at rest!" (A-A-MEN! GLORY, GLORY HALLELUJAH!)
And so on. You couldn't make out what thepreacher said any more, on account of the shoutingand crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd,and worked their way just by main strength to themourners' bench, with the tears running down theirfaces; and when all the mourners had got up there tothe front benches in a crowd, they sung and shoutedand flung themselves down on the straw, just crazyand wild.
Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, andyou could hear him over everybody; and next hewent a-charging up on to the platform, and thepreacher he begged him to speak to the people, andhe done it. He told them he was a pirate -- been apirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean -- andhis crew was thinned out considerable last spring in afight, and he was home now to take out some freshmen, and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed lastnight and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent,and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing thatever happened to him, because he was a changed mannow, and happy for the first time in his life; and,poor as he was, he was going to start right off andwork his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in therest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the truepath; for he could do it better than anybody else,being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean;and though it would take him a long time to getthere without money, he would get there anyway, andevery time he convinced a pirate he would say to him,"Don't you thank me, don't you give me no credit;it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race,and that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirateever had!"
And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.Then somebody sings out, "Take up a collection forhim, take up a collection!" Well, a half a dozenmade a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, "LetHIM pass the hat around!" Then everybody said it,the preacher too.
So the king went all through the crowd with his hatswabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praisingthem and thanking them for being so good to the poorpirates away off there; and every little while theprettiest kind of girls, with the tears running downtheir cheeks, would up and ask him would he let themkiss him for to remember him by; and he always doneit; and some of them he hugged and kissed as manyas five or six times -- and he was invited to stay aweek; and everybody wanted him to live in theirhouses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but hesaid as this was the last day of the camp-meeting hecouldn't do no good, and besides he was in a sweat toget to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work onthe pirates.
When we got back to the raft and he come to countup he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars andseventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away athree-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under awagon when he was starting home through the woods.The king said, take it all around, it laid over any dayhe'd ever put in in the missionarying line. He said itwarn't no use talking, heathens don't amount to shucksalongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.
The duke was thinking HE'D been doing pretty welltill the king come to show up, but after that he didn'tthink so so much. He had set up and printed off twolittle jobs for farmers in that printing-office -- horsebills -- and took the money, four dollars. And hehad got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for thepaper, which he said he would put in for four dollarsif they would pay in advance -- so they done it. Theprice of the paper was two dollars a year, but he tookin three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on con-dition of them paying him in advance; they were goingto pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he saidhe had just bought the concern and knocked down theprice as low as he could afford it, and was going torun it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry,which he made, himself, out of his own head -- threeverses -- kind of sweet and saddish -- the name of itwas, "Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart" --and he left that all set up and ready to print in thepaper, and didn't charge nothing for it. Well, hetook in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done apretty square day's work for it.
Then he showed us another little job he'd printedand hadn't charged for, because it was for us. It hada picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stickover his shoulder, and "$200 reward" under it. Thereading was all about Jim, and just described him to adot. It said he run away from St. Jacques' planta-tion, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, andlikely went north, and whoever would catch him andsend him back he could have the reward and expenses.
"Now," says the duke, "after to-night we can runin the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see any-body coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope,and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill andsay we captured him up the river, and were too poorto travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft oncredit from our friends and are going down to get thereward. Handcuffs and chains would look still betteron Jim, but it wouldn't go well with the story of usbeing so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes arethe correct thing -- we must preserve the unities, as wesay on the boards."
We all said the duke was pretty smart, and therecouldn't be no trouble about running daytimes. Wejudged we could make miles enough that night to getout of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke'swork in the printing office was going to make in thatlittle town; then we could boom right along if wewanted to.
We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out tillnearly ten o'clock; then we slid by, pretty wide awayfrom the town, and didn't hoist our lantern till we wasclear out of sight of it.
When Jim called me to take the watch at four in themorning, he says:
"Huck, does you reck'n we gwyne to run acrostany mo' kings on dis trip?"
"No," I says, "I reckon not."
"Well," says he, "dat's all right, den. I doan'mine one er two kings, but dat's enough. Dis one'spowerful drunk, en de duke ain' much better."
I found Jim had been trying to get him to talkFrench, so he could hear what it was like; but he saidhe had been in this country so long, and had so muchtrouble, he'd forgot it.
