Oft have we trod the vales of CastalyAnd heard sweet notes of sylvan music blownFrom antique reeds to common folk unknown:And often launched our bark upon that seaWhich the nine Muses hold in empery,And ploughed free furrows through the wave and foam,Nor spread reluctant sail for more safe homeTill we had freighted well our argosy.Of which despoiled treasures these remain,Sordello's passion, and the honeyed lineOf young Endymion, lordly TamburlaineDriving his pampered jades, and more than these,The seven-fold vision of the Florentine,And grave-browed Milton's solemn harmonies.
