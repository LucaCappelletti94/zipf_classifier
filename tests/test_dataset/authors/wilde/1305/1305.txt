THE CRITIC AS ARTIST: WITH SOME REMARKS UPON THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING NOTHINGA DIALOGUE. Part I. Persons: Gilbert and Ernest. Scene: thelibrary of a house in Piccadilly, overlooking the Green Park.GILBERT (at the Piano). My dear Ernest, what are you laughing at?ERNEST (looking up). At a capital story that I have just comeacross in this volume of Reminiscences that I have found on yourtable.GILBERT. What is the book? Ah! I see. I have not read it yet.Is it good?ERNEST. Well, while you have been playing, I have been turningover the pages with some amusement, though, as a rule, I dislikemodern memoirs. They are generally written by people who haveeither entirely lost their memories, or have never done anythingworth remembering; which, however, is, no doubt, the trueexplanation of their popularity, as the English public always feelsperfectly at its ease when a mediocrity is talking to it.GILBERT. Yes: the public is wonderfully tolerant. It forgiveseverything except genius. But I must confess that I like allmemoirs. I like them for their form, just as much as for theirmatter. In literature mere egotism is delightful. It is whatfascinates us in the letters of personalities so different asCicero and Balzac, Flaubert and Berlioz, Byron and Madame deSevigne. Whenever we come across it, and, strangely enough, it israther rare, we cannot but welcome it, and do not easily forget it.Humanity will always love Rousseau for having confessed his sins,not to a priest, but to the world, and the couchant nymphs thatCellini wrought in bronze for the castle of King Francis, the greenand gold Perseus, even, that in the open Loggia at Florence showsthe moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone, have notgiven it more pleasure than has that autobiography in which thesupreme scoundrel of the Renaissance relates the story of hissplendour and his shame. The opinions, the character, theachievements of the man, matter very little. He may be a scepticlike the gentle Sieur de Montaigne, or a saint like the bitter sonof Monica, but when he tells us his own secrets he can always charmour ears to listening and our lips to silence. The mode of thoughtthat Cardinal Newman represented--if that can be called a mode ofthought which seeks to solve intellectual problems by a denial ofthe supremacy of the intellect--may not, cannot, I think, survive.But the world will never weary of watching that troubled soul inits progress from darkness to darkness. The lonely church atLittlemore, where 'the breath of the morning is damp, andworshippers are few,' will always be dear to it, and whenever mensee the yellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of Trinity theywill think of that gracious undergraduate who saw in the flower'ssure recurrence a prophecy that he would abide for ever with theBenign Mother of his days--a prophecy that Faith, in her wisdom orher folly, suffered not to be fulfilled. Yes; autobiography isirresistible. Poor, silly, conceited Mr. Secretary Pepys haschattered his way into the circle of the Immortals, and, consciousthat indiscretion is the better part of valour, bustles about amongthem in that 'shaggy purple gown with gold buttons and looped lace'which he is so fond of describing to us, perfectly at his ease, andprattling, to his own and our infinite pleasure, of the Indian bluepetticoat that he bought for his wife, of the 'good hog's hars-let,' and the 'pleasant French fricassee of veal' that he loved toeat, of his game of bowls with Will Joyce, and his 'gadding afterbeauties,' and his reciting of Hamlet on a Sunday, and his playingof the viol on week days, and other wicked or trivial things. Evenin actual life egotism is not without its attractions. When peopletalk to us about others they are usually dull. When they talk tous about themselves they are nearly always interesting, and if onecould shut them up, when they become wearisome, as easily as onecan shut up a book of which one has grown wearied, they would beperfect absolutely.ERNEST. There is much virtue in that If, as Touchstone would say.But do you seriously propose that every man should become his ownBoswell? What would become of our industrious compilers of Livesand Recollections in that case?GILBERT. What has become of them? They are the pest of the age,nothing more and nothing less. Every great man nowadays has hisdisciples, and it is always Judas who writes the biography.ERNEST. My dear fellow!GILBERT. I am afraid it is true. Formerly we used to canonise ourheroes. The modern method is to vulgarise them. Cheap editions ofgreat books may be delightful, but cheap editions of great men areabsolutely detestable.ERNEST. May I ask, Gilbert, to whom you allude?GILBERT. Oh! to all our second-rate litterateurs. We are overrunby a set of people who, when poet or painter passes away, arrive atthe house along with the undertaker, and forget that their one dutyis to behave as mutes. But we won't talk about them. They are themere body-snatchers of literature. The dust is given to one, andthe ashes to another, and the soul is out of their reach. And now,let me play Chopin to you, or Dvorak? Shall I play you a fantasyby Dvorak? He writes passionate, curiously-coloured things.ERNEST. No; I don't want music just at present. It is far tooindefinite. Besides, I took the Baroness Bernstein down to dinnerlast night, and, though absolutely charming in every other respect,she insisted on discussing music as if it were actually written inthe German language. Now, whatever music sounds like I am glad tosay that it does not sound in the smallest degree like German.There are forms of patriotism that are really quite degrading. No;Gilbert, don't play any more. Turn round and talk to me. Talk tome till the white-horned day comes into the room. There issomething in your voice that is wonderful.GILBERT (rising from the piano). I am not in a mood for talkingto-night. I really am not. How horrid of you to smile! Where arethe cigarettes? Thanks. How exquisite these single daffodils are!They seem to be made of amber and cool ivory. They are like Greekthings of the best period. What was the story in the confessionsof the remorseful Academician that made you laugh? Tell it to me.After playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sinsthat I had never committed, and mourning over tragedies that werenot my own. Music always seems to me to produce that effect. Itcreates for one a past of which one has been ignorant, and fillsone with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from one's tears.I can fancy a man who had led a perfectly commonplace life, hearingby chance some curious piece of music, and suddenly discoveringthat his soul, without his being conscious of it, had passedthrough terrible experiences, and known fearful joys, or wildromantic loves, or great renunciations. And so tell me this story,Ernest. I want to be amused.ERNEST. Oh! I don't know that it is of any importance. But Ithought it a really admirable illustration of the true value ofordinary art-criticism. It seems that a lady once gravely askedthe remorseful Academician, as you call him, if his celebratedpicture of 'A Spring-Day at Whiteley's,' or, 'Waiting for the LastOmnibus,' or some subject of that kind, was all painted by hand?GILBERT. And was it?ERNEST. You are quite incorrigible. But, seriously speaking, whatis the use of art-criticism? Why cannot the artist be left alone,to create a new world if he wishes it, or, if not, to shadow forththe world which we already know, and of which, I fancy, we wouldeach one of us be wearied if Art, with her fine spirit of choiceand delicate instinct of selection, did not, as it were, purify itfor us, and give to it a momentary perfection. It seems to me thatthe imagination spreads, or should spread, a solitude around it,and works best in silence and in isolation. Why should the artistbe troubled by the shrill clamour of criticism? Why should thosewho cannot create take upon themselves to estimate the value ofcreative work? What can they know about it? If a man's work iseasy to understand, an explanation is unnecessary. . . .GILBERT. And if his work is incomprehensible, an explanation iswicked.ERNEST. I did not say that.GILBERT. Ah! but you should have. Nowadays, we have so fewmysteries left to us that we cannot afford to part with one ofthem. The members of the Browning Society, like the theologians ofthe Broad Church Party, or the authors of Mr. Walter Scott's GreatWriters Series, seem to me to spend their time in trying to explaintheir divinity away. Where one had hoped that Browning was amystic they have sought to show that he was simply inarticulate.Where one had fancied that he had something to conceal, they haveproved that he had but little to reveal. But I speak merely of hisincoherent work. Taken as a whole the man was great. He did notbelong to the Olympians, and had all the incompleteness of theTitan. He did not survey, and it was but rarely that he couldsing. His work is marred by struggle, violence and effort, and hepassed not from emotion to form, but from thought to chaos. Still,he was great. He has been called a thinker, and was certainly aman who was always thinking, and always thinking aloud; but it wasnot thought that fascinated him, but rather the processes by whichthought moves. It was the machine he loved, not what the machinemakes. The method by which the fool arrives at his folly was asdear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise. So much, indeed,did the subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despisedlanguage, or looked upon it as an incomplete instrument ofexpression. Rhyme, that exquisite echo which in the Muse's hollowhill creates and answers its own voice; rhyme, which in the handsof the real artist becomes not merely a material element ofmetrical beauty, but a spiritual element of thought and passionalso, waking a new mood, it may be, or stirring a fresh train ofideas, or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of sound somegolden door at which the Imagination itself had knocked in vain;rhyme, which can turn man's utterance to the speech of gods; rhyme,the one chord we have added to the Greek lyre, became in RobertBrowning's hands a grotesque, misshapen thing, which at times madehim masquerade in poetry as a low comedian, and ride Pegasus toooften with his tongue in his cheek. There are moments when hewounds us by monstrous music. Nay, if he can only get his music bybreaking the strings of his lute, he breaks them, and they snap indiscord, and no Athenian tettix, making melody from tremulouswings, lights on the ivory horn to make the movement perfect, orthe interval less harsh. Yet, he was great: and though he turnedlanguage into ignoble clay, he made from it men and women thatlive. He is the most Shakespearian creature since Shakespeare. IfShakespeare could sing with myriad lips, Browning could stammerthrough a thousand mouths. Even now, as I am speaking, andspeaking not against him but for him, there glides through the roomthe pageant of his persons. There, creeps Fra Lippo Lippi with hischeeks still burning from some girl's hot kiss. There, standsdread Saul with the lordly male-sapphires gleaming in his turban.Mildred Tresham is there, and the Spanish monk, yellow with hatred,and Blougram, and Ben Ezra, and the Bishop of St. Praxed's. Thespawn of Setebos gibbers in the corner, and Sebald, hearing Pippapass by, looks on Ottima's haggard face, and loathes her and hisown sin, and himself. Pale as the white satin of his doublet, themelancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous eyes too loyalStrafford pass forth to his doom, and Andrea shudders as he hearsthe cousins whistle in the garden, and bids his perfect wife godown. Yes, Browning was great. And as what will he be remembered?As a poet? Ah, not as a poet! He will be remembered as a writerof fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, thatwe have ever had. His sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled,and, if he could not answer his own problems, he could at least putproblems forth, and what more should an artist do? Considered fromthe point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to himwho made Hamlet. Had he been articulate, he might have sat besidehim. The only man who can touch the hem of his garment is GeorgeMeredith. Meredith is a prose Browning, and so is Browning. Heused poetry as a medium for writing in prose.ERNEST. There is something in what you say, but there is noteverything in what you say. In many points you are unjust.GILBERT. It is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves. Butlet us return to the particular point at issue. What was it thatyou said?ERNEST. Simply this: that in the best days of art there were noart-critics.GILBERT. I seem to have heard that observation before, Ernest. Ithas all the vitality of error and all the tediousness of an oldfriend.ERNEST. It is true. Yes: there is no use your tossing your headin that petulant manner. It is quite true. In the best days ofart there were no art-critics. The sculptor hewed from the marbleblock the great white-limbed Hermes that slept within it. Thewaxers and gilders of images gave tone and texture to the statue,and the world, when it saw it, worshipped and was dumb. He pouredthe glowing bronze into the mould of sand, and the river of redmetal cooled into noble curves and took the impress of the body ofa god. With enamel or polished jewels he gave sight to thesightless eyes. The hyacinth-like curls grew crisp beneath hisgraver. And when, in some dim frescoed fane, or pillared sunlitportico, the child of Leto stood upon his pedestal, those whopassed by, [Greek text which cannot be reproduced], becameconscious of a new influence that had come across their lives, anddreamily, or with a sense of strange and quickening joy, went totheir homes or daily labour, or wandered, it may be, through thecity gates to that nymph-haunted meadow where young Phaedrus bathedhis feet, and, lying there on the soft grass, beneath the tallwind--whispering planes and flowering agnus castus, began to thinkof the wonder of beauty, and grew silent with unaccustomed awe. Inthose days the artist was free. From the river valley he took thefine clay in his fingers, and with a little tool of wood or bone,fashioned it into forms so exquisite that the people gave them tothe dead as their playthings, and we find them still in the dustytombs on the yellow hillside by Tanagra, with the faint gold andthe fading crimson still lingering about hair and lips and raiment.On a wall of fresh plaster, stained with bright sandyx or mixedwith milk and saffron, he pictured one who trod with tired feet thepurple white-starred fields of asphodel, one 'in whose eyelids laythe whole of the Trojan War,' Polyxena, the daughter of Priam; orfigured Odysseus, the wise and cunning, bound by tight cords to themast-step, that he might listen without hurt to the singing of theSirens, or wandering by the clear river of Acheron, where theghosts of fishes flitted over the pebbly bed; or showed the Persianin trews and mitre flying before the Greek at Marathon, or thegalleys clashing their beaks of brass in the little Salaminian bay.He drew with silver-point and charcoal upon parchment and preparedcedar. Upon ivory and rose-coloured terracotta he painted withwax, making the wax fluid with juice of olives, and with heatedirons making it firm. Panel and marble and linen canvas becamewonderful as his brush swept across them; and life seeing her ownimage, was still, and dared not speak. All life, indeed, was his,from the merchants seated in the market-place to the cloakedshepherd lying on the hill; from the nymph hidden in the laurelsand the faun that pipes at noon, to the king whom, in long green-curtained litter, slaves bore upon oil-bright shoulders, and fannedwith peacock fans. Men and women, with pleasure or sorrow in theirfaces, passed before him. He watched them, and their secret becamehis. Through form and colour he re-created a world.All subtle arts belonged to him also. He held the gem against therevolving disk, and the amethyst became the purple couch forAdonis, and across the veined sardonyx sped Artemis with herhounds. He beat out the gold into roses, and strung them togetherfor necklace or armlet. He beat out the gold into wreaths for theconqueror's helmet, or into palmates for the Tyrian robe, or intomasks for the royal dead. On the back of the silver mirror hegraved Thetis borne by her Nereids, or love-sick Phaedra with hernurse, or Persephone, weary of memory, putting poppies in her hair.The potter sat in his shed, and, flower-like from the silent wheel,the vase rose up beneath his hands. He decorated the base and stemand ears with pattern of dainty olive-leaf, or foliated acanthus,or curved and crested wave. Then in black or red he painted ladswrestling, or in the race: knights in full armour, with strangeheraldic shields and curious visors, leaning from shell-shapedchariot over rearing steeds: the gods seated at the feast orworking their miracles: the heroes in their victory or in theirpain. Sometimes he would etch in thin vermilion lines upon aground of white the languid bridegroom and his bride, with Eroshovering round them--an Eros like one of Donatello's angels, alittle laughing thing with gilded or with azure wings. On thecurved side he would write the name of his friend. [Greek textwhich cannot be reproduced] or [Greek text which cannot bereproduced] tells us the story of his days. Again, on the rim ofthe wide flat cup he would draw the stag browsing, or the lion atrest, as his fancy willed it. From the tiny perfume-bottle laughedAphrodite at her toilet, and, with bare-limbed Maenads in histrain, Dionysus danced round the wine-jar on naked must-stainedfeet, while, satyr-like, the old Silenus sprawled upon the bloatedskins, or shook that magic spear which was tipped with a frettedfir-cone, and wreathed with dark ivy. And no one came to troublethe artist at his work. No irresponsible chatter disturbed him.He was not worried by opinions. By the Ilyssus, says Arnoldsomewhere, there was no Higginbotham. By the Ilyssus, my dearGilbert, there were no silly art congresses bringing provincialismto the provinces and teaching the mediocrity how to mouth. By theIlyssus there were no tedious magazines about art, in which theindustrious prattle of what they do not understand. On the reed-grown banks of that little stream strutted no ridiculous journalismmonopolising the seat of judgment when it should be apologising inthe dock. The Greeks had no art-critics.GILBERT. Ernest, you are quite delightful, but your views areterribly unsound. I am afraid that you have been listening to theconversation of some one older than yourself. That is always adangerous thing to do, and if you allow it to degenerate into ahabit you will find it absolutely fatal to any intellectualdevelopment. As for modern journalism, it is not my business todefend it. It justifies its own existence by the great Darwinianprinciple of the survival of the vulgarest. I have merely to dowith literature.ERNEST. But what is the difference between literature andjournalism?GILBERT. Oh! journalism is unreadable, and literature is not read.That is all. But with regard to your statement that the Greeks hadno art-critics, I assure you that is quite absurd. It would bemore just to say that the Greeks were a nation of art-critics.ERNEST. Really?GILBERT. Yes, a nation of art-critics. But I don't wish todestroy the delightfully unreal picture that you have drawn of therelation of the Hellenic artist to the intellectual spirit of hisage. To give an accurate description of what has never occurred isnot merely the proper occupation of the historian, but theinalienable privilege of any man of parts and culture. Still lessdo I desire to talk learnedly. Learned conversation is either theaffectation of the ignorant or the profession of the mentallyunemployed. And, as for what is called improving conversation,that is merely the foolish method by which the still more foolishphilanthropist feebly tries to disarm the just rancour of thecriminal classes. No: let me play to you some mad scarlet thingby Dvorak. The pallid figures on the tapestry are smiling at us,and the heavy eyelids of my bronze Narcissus are folded in sleep.Don't let us discuss anything solemnly. I am but too conscious ofthe fact that we are born in an age when only the dull are treatedseriously, and I live in terror of not being misunderstood. Don'tdegrade me into the position of giving you useful information.Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember fromtime to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.Through the parted curtains of the window I see the moon like aclipped piece of silver. Like gilded bees the stars cluster roundher. The sky is a hard hollow sapphire. Let us go out into thenight. Thought is wonderful, but adventure is more wonderfulstill. Who knows but we may meet Prince Florizel of Bohemia, andhear the fair Cuban tell us that she is not what she seems?ERNEST. You are horribly wilful. I insist on your discussing thismatter with me. You have said that the Greeks were a nation ofart-critics. What art-criticism have they left us?GILBERT. My dear Ernest, even if not a single fragment of art-criticism had come down to us from Hellenic or Hellenistic days, itwould be none the less true that the Greeks were a nation of art-critics, and that they invented the criticism of art just as theyinvented the criticism of everything else. For, after all, what isour primary debt to the Greeks? Simply the critical spirit. And,this spirit, which they exercised on questions of religion andscience, of ethics and metaphysics, of politics and education, theyexercised on questions of art also, and, indeed, of the two supremeand highest arts, they have left us the most flawless system ofcriticism that the world has ever seen.ERNEST. But what are the two supreme and highest arts?GILBERT. Life and Literature, life and the perfect expression oflife. The principles of the former, as laid down by the Greeks, wemay not realise in an age so marred by false ideals as our own.The principles of the latter, as they laid them down, are, in manycases, so subtle that we can hardly understand them. Recognisingthat the most perfect art is that which most fully mirrors man inall his infinite variety, they elaborated the criticism oflanguage, considered in the light of the mere material of that art,to a point to which we, with our accentual system of reasonable oremotional emphasis, can barely if at all attain; studying, forinstance, the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as amodern musician studies harmony and counterpoint, and, I needhardly say, with much keener aesthetic instinct. In this they wereright, as they were right in all things. Since the introduction ofprinting, and the fatal development of the habit of reading amongstthe middle and lower classes of this country, there has been atendency in literature to appeal more and more to the eye, and lessand less to the ear which is really the sense which, from thestandpoint of pure art, it should seek to please, and by whosecanons of pleasure it should abide always. Even the work of Mr.Pater, who is, on the whole, the most perfect master of Englishprose now creating amongst us, is often far more like a piece ofmosaic than a passage in music, and seems, here and there, to lackthe true rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richnessof effect that such rhythmical life produces. We, in fact, havemade writing a definite mode of composition, and have treated it asa form of elaborate design. The Greeks, upon the other hand,regarded writing simply as a method of chronicling. Their test wasalways the spoken word in its musical and metrical relations. Thevoice was the medium, and the ear the critic. I have sometimesthought that the story of Homer's blindness might be really anartistic myth, created in critical days, and serving to remind us,not merely that the great poet is always a seer, seeing less withthe eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul, butthat he is a true singer also, building his song out of music,repeating each line over and over again to himself till he hascaught the secret of its melody, chaunting in darkness the wordsthat are winged with light. Certainly, whether this be so or not,it was to his blindness, as an occasion, if not as a cause, thatEngland's great poet owed much of the majestic movement andsonorous splendour of his later verse. When Milton could no longerwrite he began to sing. Who would match the measures of Comus withthe measures of Samson Agonistes, or of Paradise Lost or Regained?When Milton became blind he composed, as every one should compose,with the voice purely, and so the pipe or reed of earlier daysbecame that mighty many-stopped organ whose rich reverberant musichas all the stateliness of Homeric verse, if it seeks not to haveits swiftness, and is the one imperishable inheritance of Englishliterature sweeping through all the ages, because above them, andabiding with us ever, being immortal in its form. Yes: writinghas done much harm to writers. We must return to the voice. Thatmust be our test, and perhaps then we shall be able to appreciatesome of the subtleties of Greek art-criticism.As it now is, we cannot do so. Sometimes, when I have written apiece of prose that I have been modest enough to considerabsolutely free from fault, a dreadful thought comes over me that Imay have been guilty of the immoral effeminacy of using trochaicand tribrachic movements, a crime for which a learned critic of theAugustan age censures with most just severity the brilliant ifsomewhat paradoxical Hegesias. I grow cold when I think of it, andwonder to myself if the admirable ethical effect of the prose ofthat charming writer, who once in a spirit of reckless generositytowards the uncultivated portion of our community proclaimed themonstrous doctrine that conduct is three-fourths of life, will notsome day be entirely annihilated by the discovery that the paeonshave been wrongly placed.ERNEST. Ah! now you are flippant.GILBERT. Who would not be flippant when he is gravely told thatthe Greeks had no art-critics? I can understand it being said thatthe constructive genius of the Greeks lost itself in criticism, butnot that the race to whom we owe the critical spirit did notcriticise. You will not ask me to give you a survey of Greek artcriticism from Plato to Plotinus. The night is too lovely forthat, and the moon, if she heard us, would put more ashes on herface than are there already. But think merely of one perfectlittle work of aesthetic criticism, Aristotle's Treatise on Poetry.It is not perfect in form, for it is badly written, consistingperhaps of notes dotted down for an art lecture, or of isolatedfragments destined for some larger book, but in temper andtreatment it is perfect, absolutely. The ethical effect of art,its importance to culture, and its place in the formation ofcharacter, had been done once for all by Plato; but here we haveart treated, not from the moral, but from the purely aestheticpoint of view. Plato had, of course, dealt with many definitelyartistic subjects, such as the importance of unity in a work ofart, the necessity for tone and harmony, the aesthetic value ofappearances, the relation of the visible arts to the externalworld, and the relation of fiction to fact. He first perhapsstirred in the soul of man that desire that we have not yetsatisfied, the desire to know the connection between Beauty andTruth, and the place of Beauty in the moral and intellectual orderof the Kosmos. The problems of idealism and realism, as he setsthem forth, may seem to many to be somewhat barren of result in themetaphysical sphere of abstract being in which he places them, buttransfer them to the sphere of art, and you will find that they arestill vital and full of meaning. It may be that it is as a criticof Beauty that Plato is destined to live, and that by altering thename of the sphere of his speculation we shall find a newphilosophy. But Aristotle, like Goethe, deals with art primarilyin its concrete manifestations, taking Tragedy, for instance, andinvestigating the material it uses, which is language, its subject-matter, which is life, the method by which it works, which isaction, the conditions under which it reveals itself, which arethose of theatric presentation, its logical structure, which isplot, and its final aesthetic appeal, which is to the sense ofbeauty realised through the passions of pity and awe. Thatpurification and spiritualising of the nature which he calls [Greektext which cannot be reproduced] is, as Goethe saw, essentiallyaesthetic, and is not moral, as Lessing fancied. Concerninghimself primarily with the impression that the work of artproduces, Aristotle sets himself to analyse that impression, toinvestigate its source, to see how it is engendered. As aphysiologist and psychologist, he knows that the health of afunction resides in energy. To have a capacity for a passion andnot to realise it, is to make oneself incomplete and limited. Themimic spectacle of life that Tragedy affords cleanses the bosom ofmuch 'perilous stuff,' and by presenting high and worthy objectsfor the exercise of the emotions purifies and spiritualises theman; nay, not merely does it spiritualise him, but it initiates himalso into noble feelings of which he might else have known nothing,the word [Greek text which cannot be reproduced] having, it hassometimes seemed to me, a definite allusion to the rite ofinitiation, if indeed that be not, as I am occasionally tempted tofancy, its true and only meaning here. This is of course a mereoutline of the book. But you see what a perfect piece of aestheticcriticism it is. Who indeed but a Greek could have analysed art sowell? After reading it, one does not wonder any longer thatAlexandria devoted itself so largely to art-criticism, and that wefind the artistic temperaments of the day investigating everyquestion of style and manner, discussing the great Academic schoolsof painting, for instance, such as the school of Sicyon, thatsought to preserve the dignified traditions of the antique mode, orthe realistic and impressionist schools, that aimed at reproducingactual life, or the elements of ideality in portraiture, or theartistic value of the epic form in an age so modern as theirs, orthe proper subject-matter for the artist. Indeed, I fear that theinartistic temperaments of the day busied themselves also inmatters of literature and art, for the accusations of plagiarismwere endless, and such accusations proceed either from the thincolourless lips of impotence, or from the grotesque mouths of thosewho, possessing nothing of their own, fancy that they can gain areputation for wealth by crying out that they have been robbed.And I assure you, my dear Ernest, that the Greeks chattered aboutpainters quite as much as people do nowadays, and had their privateviews, and shilling exhibitions, and Arts and Crafts guilds, andPre-Raphaelite movements, and movements towards realism, andlectured about art, and wrote essays on art, and produced theirart-historians, and their archaeologists, and all the rest of it.Why, even the theatrical managers of travelling companies broughttheir dramatic critics with them when they went on tour, and paidthem very handsome salaries for writing laudatory notices.Whatever, in fact, is modern in our life we owe to the Greeks.Whatever is an anachronism is due to mediaevalism. It is theGreeks who have given us the whole system of art-criticism, and howfine their critical instinct was, may be seen from the fact thatthe material they criticised with most care was, as I have alreadysaid, language. For the material that painter or sculptor uses ismeagre in comparison with that of words. Words have not merelymusic as sweet as that of viol and lute, colour as rich and vividas any that makes lovely for us the canvas of the Venetian or theSpaniard, and plastic form no less sure and certain than that whichreveals itself in marble or in bronze, but thought and passion andspirituality are theirs also, are theirs indeed alone. If theGreeks had criticised nothing but language, they would still havebeen the great art-critics of the world. To know the principles ofthe highest art is to know the principles of all the arts.But I see that the moon is hiding behind a sulphur-coloured cloud.Out of a tawny mane of drift she gleams like a lion's eye. She isafraid that I will talk to you of Lucian and Longinus, ofQuinctilian and Dionysius, of Pliny and Fronto and Pausanias, ofall those who in the antique world wrote or lectured upon artmatters. She need not be afraid. I am tired of my expedition intothe dim, dull abyss of facts. There is nothing left for me now butthe divine [Greek text which cannot be reproduced] of anothercigarette. Cigarettes have at least the charm of leaving oneunsatisfied.ERNEST. Try one of mine. They are rather good. I get them directfrom Cairo. The only use of our attaches is that they supply theirfriends with excellent tobacco. And as the moon has hiddenherself, let us talk a little longer. I am quite ready to admitthat I was wrong in what I said about the Greeks. They were, asyou have pointed out, a nation of art-critics. I acknowledge it,and I feel a little sorry for them. For the creative faculty ishigher than the critical. There is really no comparison betweenthem.GILBERT. The antithesis between them is entirely arbitrary.Without the critical faculty, there is no artistic creation at all,worthy of the name. You spoke a little while ago of that finespirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection by which theartist realises life for us, and gives to it a momentaryperfection. Well, that spirit of choice, that subtle tact ofomission, is really the critical faculty in one of its mostcharacteristic moods, and no one who does not possess this criticalfaculty can create anything at all in art. Arnold's definition ofliterature as a criticism of life was not very felicitous in form,but it showed how keenly he recognised the importance of thecritical element in all creative work.ERNEST. I should have said that great artists work unconsciously,that they were 'wiser than they knew,' as, I think, Emerson remarkssomewhere.GILBERT. It is really not so, Ernest. All fine imaginative workis self-conscious and deliberate. No poet sings because he mustsing. At least, no great poet does. A great poet sings because hechooses to sing. It is so now, and it has always been so. We aresometimes apt to think that the voices that sounded at the dawn ofpoetry were simpler, fresher, and more natural than ours, and thatthe world which the early poets looked at, and through which theywalked, had a kind of poetical quality of its own, and almostwithout changing could pass into song. The snow lies thick nowupon Olympus, and its steep scarped sides are bleak and barren, butonce, we fancy, the white feet of the Muses brushed the dew fromthe anemones in the morning, and at evening came Apollo to sing tothe shepherds in the vale. But in this we are merely lending toother ages what we desire, or think we desire, for our own. Ourhistorical sense is at fault. Every century that produces poetryis, so far, an artificial century, and the work that seems to us tobe the most natural and simple product of its time is always theresult of the most self-conscious effort. Believe me, Ernest,there is no fine art without self-consciousness, and self-consciousness and the critical spirit are one.ERNEST. I see what you mean, and there is much in it. But surelyyou would admit that the great poems of the early world, theprimitive, anonymous collective poems, were the result of theimagination of races, rather than of the imagination ofindividuals?GILBERT. Not when they became poetry. Not when they received abeautiful form. For there is no art where there is no style, andno style where there is no unity, and unity is of the individual.No doubt Homer had old ballads and stories to deal with, asShakespeare had chronicles and plays and novels from which to work,but they were merely his rough material. He took them, and shapedthem into song. They become his, because he made them lovely.They were built out of music,And so not built at all,And therefore built for ever.The longer one studies life and literature, the more strongly onefeels that behind everything that is wonderful stands theindividual, and that it is not the moment that makes the man, butthe man who creates the age. Indeed, I am inclined to think thateach myth and legend that seems to us to spring out of the wonder,or terror, or fancy of tribe and nation, was in its origin theinvention of one single mind. The curiously limited number of themyths seems to me to point to this conclusion. But we must not gooff into questions of comparative mythology. We must keep tocriticism. And what I want to point out is this. An age that hasno criticism is either an age in which art is immobile, hieratic,and confined to the reproduction of formal types, or an age thatpossesses no art at all. There have been critical ages that havenot been creative, in the ordinary sense of the word, ages in whichthe spirit of man has sought to set in order the treasures of histreasure-house, to separate the gold from the silver, and thesilver from the lead, to count over the jewels, and to give namesto the pearls. But there has never been a creative age that hasnot been critical also. For it is the critical faculty thatinvents fresh forms. The tendency of creation is to repeat itself.It is to the critical instinct that we owe each new school thatsprings up, each new mould that art finds ready to its hand. Thereis really not a single form that art now uses that does not come tous from the critical spirit of Alexandria, where these forms wereeither stereotyped or invented or made perfect. I say Alexandria,not merely because it was there that the Greek spirit became mostself-conscious, and indeed ultimately expired in scepticism andtheology, but because it was to that city, and not to Athens, thatRome turned for her models, and it was through the survival, suchas it was, of the Latin language that culture lived at all. When,at the Renaissance, Greek literature dawned upon Europe, the soilhad been in some measure prepared for it. But, to get rid of thedetails of history, which are always wearisome and usuallyinaccurate, let us say generally, that the forms of art have beendue to the Greek critical spirit. To it we owe the epic, thelyric, the entire drama in every one of its developments, includingburlesque, the idyll, the romantic novel, the novel of adventure,the essay, the dialogue, the oration, the lecture, for whichperhaps we should not forgive them, and the epigram, in all thewide meaning of that word. In fact, we owe it everything, exceptthe sonnet, to which, however, some curious parallels of thought-movement may be traced in the Anthology, American journalism, towhich no parallel can be found anywhere, and the ballad in shamScotch dialect, which one of our most industrious writers hasrecently proposed should be made the basis for a final andunanimous effort on the part of our second-rate poets to makethemselves really romantic. Each new school, as it appears, criesout against criticism, but it is to the critical faculty in manthat it owes its origin. The mere creative instinct does notinnovate, but reproduces.ERNEST. You have been talking of criticism as an essential part ofthe creative spirit, and I now fully accept your theory. But whatof criticism outside creation? I have a foolish habit of readingperiodicals, and it seems to me that most modern criticism isperfectly valueless.GILBERT. So is most modern creative work also. Mediocrityweighing mediocrity in the balance, and incompetence applauding itsbrother--that is the spectacle which the artistic activity ofEngland affords us from time to time. And yet, I feel I am alittle unfair in this matter. As a rule, the critics--I speak, ofcourse, of the higher class, of those in fact who write for thesixpenny papers--are far more cultured than the people whose workthey are called upon to review. This is, indeed, only what onewould expect, for criticism demands infinitely more cultivationthan creation does.ERNEST. Really?GILBERT. Certainly. Anybody can write a three-volumed novel. Itmerely requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature.The difficulty that I should fancy the reviewer feels is thedifficulty of sustaining any standard. Where there is no style astandard must be impossible. The poor reviewers are apparentlyreduced to be the reporters of the police-court of literature, thechroniclers of the doings of the habitual criminals of art. It issometimes said of them that they do not read all through the worksthey are called upon to criticise. They do not. Or at least theyshould not. If they did so, they would become confirmedmisanthropes, or if I may borrow a phrase from one of the prettyNewnham graduates, confirmed womanthropes for the rest of theirlives. Nor is it necessary. To know the vintage and quality of awine one need not drink the whole cask. It must be perfectly easyin half an hour to say whether a book is worth anything or worthnothing. Ten minutes are really sufficient, if one has theinstinct for form. Who wants to wade through a dull volume? Onetastes it, and that is quite enough--more than enough, I shouldimagine. I am aware that there are many honest workers in paintingas well as in literature who object to criticism entirely. Theyare quite right. Their work stands in no intellectual relation totheir age. It brings us no new element of pleasure. It suggestsno fresh departure of thought, or passion, or beauty. It shouldnot be spoken of. It should be left to the oblivion that itdeserves.ERNEST. But, my dear fellow--excuse me for interrupting you--youseem to me to be allowing your passion for criticism to lead you agreat deal too far. For, after all, even you must admit that it ismuch more difficult to do a thing than to talk about it.GILBERT. More difficult to do a thing than to talk about it? Notat all. That is a gross popular error. It is very much moredifficult to talk about a thing than to do it. In the sphere ofactual life that is of course obvious. Anybody can make history.Only a great man can write it. There is no mode of action, no formof emotion, that we do not share with the lower animals. It isonly by language that we rise above them, or above each other--bylanguage, which is the parent, and not the child, of thought.Action, indeed, is always easy, and when presented to us in itsmost aggravated, because most continuous form, which I take to bethat of real industry, becomes simply the refuge of people who havenothing whatsoever to do. No, Ernest, don't talk about action. Itis a blind thing dependent on external influences, and moved by animpulse of whose nature it is unconscious. It is a thingincomplete in its essence, because limited by accident, andignorant of its direction, being always at variance with its aim.Its basis is the lack of imagination. It is the last resource ofthose who know not how to dream.ERNEST. Gilbert, you treat the world as if it were a crystal ball.You hold it in your hand, and reverse it to please a wilful fancy.You do nothing but re-write history.GILBERT. The one duty we owe to history is to re-write it. Thatis not the least of the tasks in store for the critical spirit.When we have fully discovered the scientific laws that govern life,we shall realise that the one person who has more illusions thanthe dreamer is the man of action. He, indeed, knows neither theorigin of his deeds nor their results. From the field in which hethought that he had sown thorns, we have gathered our vintage, andthe fig-tree that he planted for our pleasure is as barren as thethistle, and more bitter. It is because Humanity has never knownwhere it was going that it has been able to find its way.ERNEST. You think, then, that in the sphere of action a consciousaim is a delusion?GILBERT. It is worse than a delusion. If we lived long enough tosee the results of our actions it may be that those who callthemselves good would be sickened with a dull remorse, and thosewhom the world calls evil stirred by a noble joy. Each littlething that we do passes into the great machine of life which maygrind our virtues to powder and make them worthless, or transformour sins into elements of a new civilisation, more marvellous andmore splendid than any that has gone before. But men are theslaves of words. They rage against Materialism, as they call it,forgetting that there has been no material improvement that has notspiritualised the world, and that there have been few, if any,spiritual awakenings that have not wasted the world's faculties inbarren hopes, and fruitless aspirations, and empty or trammellingcreeds. What is termed Sin is an essential element of progress.Without it the world would stagnate, or grow old, or becomecolourless. By its curiosity Sin increases the experience of therace. Through its intensified assertion of individualism, it savesus from monotony of type. In its rejection of the current notionsabout morality, it is one with the higher ethics. And as for thevirtues! What are the virtues? Nature, M. Renan tells us, careslittle about chastity, and it may be that it is to the shame of theMagdalen, and not to their own purity, that the Lucretias of modernlife owe their freedom from stain. Charity, as even those of whosereligion it makes a formal part have been compelled to acknowledge,creates a multitude of evils. The mere existence of conscience,that faculty of which people prate so much nowadays, and are soignorantly proud, is a sign of our imperfect development. It mustbe merged in instinct before we become fine. Self-denial is simplya method by which man arrests his progress, and self-sacrifice asurvival of the mutilation of the savage, part of that old worshipof pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the world,and which even now makes its victims day by day, and has its altarsin the land. Virtues! Who knows what the virtues are? Not you.Not I. Not any one. It is well for our vanity that we slay thecriminal, for if we suffered him to live he might show us what wehad gained by his crime. It is well for his peace that the saintgoes to his martyrdom. He is spared the sight of the horror of hisharvest.ERNEST. Gilbert, you sound too harsh a note. Let us go back tothe more gracious fields of literature. What was it you said?That it was more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it?GILBERT (after a pause). Yes: I believe I ventured upon thatsimple truth. Surely you see now that I am right? When man actshe is a puppet. When he describes he is a poet. The whole secretlies in that. It was easy enough on the sandy plains by windyIlion to send the notched arrow from the painted bow, or to hurlagainst the shield of hide and flamelike brass the long ash-handledspear. It was easy for the adulterous queen to spread the Tyriancarpets for her lord, and then, as he lay couched in the marblebath, to throw over his head the purple net, and call to hersmooth-faced lover to stab through the meshes at the heart thatshould have broken at Aulis. For Antigone even, with Death waitingfor her as her bridegroom, it was easy to pass through the taintedair at noon, and climb the hill, and strew with kindly earth thewretched naked corse that had no tomb. But what of those who wroteabout these things? What of those who gave them reality, and madethem live for ever? Are they not greater than the men and womenthey sing of? 'Hector that sweet knight is dead,' and Lucian tellsus how in the dim under-world Menippus saw the bleaching skull ofHelen, and marvelled that it was for so grim a favour that allthose horned ships were launched, those beautiful mailed men laidlow, those towered cities brought to dust. Yet, every day theswanlike daughter of Leda comes out on the battlements, and looksdown at the tide of war. The greybeards wonder at her loveliness,and she stands by the side of the king. In his chamber of stainedivory lies her leman. He is polishing his dainty armour, andcombing the scarlet plume. With squire and page, her husbandpasses from tent to tent. She can see his bright hair, and hears,or fancies that she hears, that clear cold voice. In the courtyardbelow, the son of Priam is buckling on his brazen cuirass. Thewhite arms of Andromache are around his neck. He sets his helmeton the ground, lest their babe should be frightened. Behind theembroidered curtains of his pavilion sits Achilles, in perfumedraiment, while in harness of gilt and silver the friend of his soularrays himself to go forth to the fight. From a curiously carvenchest that his mother Thetis had brought to his ship-side, the Lordof the Myrmidons takes out that mystic chalice that the lip of manhad never touched, and cleanses it with brimstone, and with freshwater cools it, and, having washed his hands, fills with black wineits burnished hollow, and spills the thick grape-blood upon theground in honour of Him whom at Dodona barefooted prophetsworshipped, and prays to Him, and knows not that he prays in vain,and that by the hands of two knights from Troy, Panthous' son,Euphorbus, whose love-locks were looped with gold, and the Priamid,the lion-hearted, Patroklus, the comrade of comrades, must meet hisdoom. Phantoms, are they? Heroes of mist and mountain? Shadowsin a song? No: they are real. Action! What is action? It diesat the moment of its energy. It is a base concession to fact. Theworld is made by the singer for the dreamer.ERNEST. While you talk it seems to me to be so.GILBERT. It is so in truth. On the mouldering citadel of Troylies the lizard like a thing of green bronze. The owl has builther nest in the palace of Priam. Over the empty plain wandershepherd and goatherd with their flocks, and where, on the wine-surfaced, oily sea, [Greek text which cannot be reproduced], asHomer calls it, copper-prowed and streaked with vermilion, thegreat galleys of the Danaoi came in their gleaming crescent, thelonely tunny-fisher sits in his little boat and watches the bobbingcorks of his net. Yet, every morning the doors of the city arethrown open, and on foot, or in horse-drawn chariot, the warriorsgo forth to battle, and mock their enemies from behind their ironmasks. All day long the fight rages, and when night comes thetorches gleam by the tents, and the cresset burns in the hall.Those who live in marble or on painted panel, know of life but asingle exquisite instant, eternal indeed in its beauty, but limitedto one note of passion or one mood of calm. Those whom the poetmakes live have their myriad emotions of joy and terror, of courageand despair, of pleasure and of suffering. The seasons come and goin glad or saddening pageant, and with winged or leaden feet theyears pass by before them. They have their youth and theirmanhood, they are children, and they grow old. It is always dawnfor St. Helena, as Veronese saw her at the window. Through thestill morning air the angels bring her the symbol of God's pain.The cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from herbrow. On that little hill by the city of Florence, where thelovers of Giorgione are lying, it is always the solstice of noon,of noon made so languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slimnaked girl dip into the marble tank the round bubble of clearglass, and the long fingers of the lute-player rest idly upon thechords. It is twilight always for the dancing nymphs whom Corotset free among the silver poplars of France. In eternal twilightthey move, those frail diaphanous figures, whose tremulous whitefeet seem not to touch the dew-drenched grass they tread on. Butthose who walk in epos, drama, or romance, see through thelabouring months the young moons wax and wane, and watch the nightfrom evening unto morning star, and from sunrise unto sunsettingcan note the shifting day with all its gold and shadow. For them,as for us, the flowers bloom and wither, and the Earth, that Green-tressed Goddess as Coleridge calls her, alters her raiment fortheir pleasure. The statue is concentrated to one moment ofperfection. The image stained upon the canvas possesses nospiritual element of growth or change. If they know nothing ofdeath, it is because they know little of life, for the secrets oflife and death belong to those, and those only, whom the sequenceof time affects, and who possess not merely the present but thefuture, and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame.Movement, that problem of the visible arts, can be truly realisedby Literature alone. It is Literature that shows us the body inits swiftness and the soul in its unrest.ERNEST. Yes; I see now what you mean. But, surely, the higher youplace the creative artist, the lower must the critic rank.GILBERT. Why so?ERNEST. Because the best that he can give us will be but an echoof rich music, a dim shadow of clear-outlined form. It may,indeed, be that life is chaos, as you tell me that it is; that itsmartyrdoms are mean and its heroisms ignoble; and that it is thefunction of Literature to create, from the rough material of actualexistence, a new world that will be more marvellous, more enduring,and more true than the world that common eyes look upon, andthrough which common natures seek to realise their perfection. Butsurely, if this new world has been made by the spirit and touch ofa great artist, it will be a thing so complete and perfect thatthere will be nothing left for the critic to do. I quiteunderstand now, and indeed admit most readily, that it is far moredifficult to talk about a thing than to do it. But it seems to methat this sound and sensible maxim, which is really extremelysoothing to one's feelings, and should be adopted as its motto byevery Academy of Literature all over the world, applies only to therelations that exist between Art and Life, and not to any relationsthat there may be between Art and Criticism.GILBERT. But, surely, Criticism is itself an art. And just asartistic creation implies the working of the critical faculty, and,indeed, without it cannot be said to exist at all, so Criticism isreally creative in the highest sense of the word. Criticism is, infact, both creative and independent.ERNEST. Independent?GILBERT. Yes; independent. Criticism is no more to be judged byany low standard of imitation or resemblance than is the work ofpoet or sculptor. The critic occupies the same relation to thework of art that he criticises as the artist does to the visibleworld of form and colour, or the unseen world of passion and ofthought. He does not even require for the perfection of his artthe finest materials. Anything will serve his purpose. And justas out of the sordid and sentimental amours of the silly wife of asmall country doctor in the squalid village of Yonville-l'Abbaye,near Rouen, Gustave Flaubert was able to create a classic, and makea masterpiece of style, so, from subjects of little or of noimportance, such as the pictures in this year's Royal Academy, orin any year's Royal Academy for that matter, Mr. Lewis Morris'spoems, M. Ohnet's novels, or the plays of Mr. Henry Arthur Jones,the true critic can, if it be his pleasure so to direct or wastehis faculty of contemplation, produce work that will be flawless inbeauty and instinct with intellectual subtlety. Why not? Dulnessis always an irresistible temptation for brilliancy, and stupidityis the permanent Bestia Trionfans that calls wisdom from its cave.To an artist so creative as the critic, what does subject-mattersignify? No more and no less than it does to the novelist and thepainter. Like them, he can find his motives everywhere. Treatmentis the test. There is nothing that has not in it suggestion orchallenge.ERNEST. But is Criticism really a creative art?GILBERT. Why should it not be? It works with materials, and putsthem into a form that is at once new and delightful. What more canone say of poetry? Indeed, I would call criticism a creationwithin a creation. For just as the great artists, from Homer andAEschylus, down to Shakespeare and Keats, did not go directly tolife for their subject-matter, but sought for it in myth, andlegend, and ancient tale, so the critic deals with materials thatothers have, as it were, purified for him, and to which imaginativeform and colour have been already added. Nay, more, I would saythat the highest Criticism, being the purest form of personalimpression, is in its way more creative than creation, as it hasleast reference to any standard external to itself, and is, infact, its own reason for existing, and, as the Greeks would put it,in itself, and to itself, an end. Certainly, it is nevertrammelled by any shackles of verisimilitude. No ignobleconsiderations of probability, that cowardly concession to thetedious repetitions of domestic or public life, affect it ever.One may appeal from fiction unto fact. But from the soul there isno appeal.ERNEST. From the soul?GILBERT. Yes, from the soul. That is what the highest criticismreally is, the record of one's own soul. It is more fascinatingthan history, as it is concerned simply with oneself. It is moredelightful than philosophy, as its subject is concrete and notabstract, real and not vague. It is the only civilised form ofautobiography, as it deals not with the events, but with thethoughts of one's life; not with life's physical accidents of deedor circumstance, but with the spiritual moods and imaginativepassions of the mind. I am always amused by the silly vanity ofthose writers and artists of our day who seem to imagine that theprimary function of the critic is to chatter about their second-rate work. The best that one can say of most modern creative artis that it is just a little less vulgar than reality, and so thecritic, with his fine sense of distinction and sure instinct ofdelicate refinement, will prefer to look into the silver mirror orthrough the woven veil, and will turn his eyes away from the chaosand clamour of actual existence, though the mirror be tarnished andthe veil be torn. His sole aim is to chronicle his ownimpressions. It is for him that pictures are painted, bookswritten, and marble hewn into form.ERNEST. I seem to have heard another theory of Criticism.GILBERT. Yes: it has been said by one whose gracious memory weall revere, and the music of whose pipe once lured Proserpina fromher Sicilian fields, and made those white feet stir, and not invain, the Cumnor cowslips, that the proper aim of Criticism is tosee the object as in itself it really is. But this is a veryserious error, and takes no cognisance of Criticism's most perfectform, which is in its essence purely subjective, and seeks toreveal its own secret and not the secret of another. For thehighest Criticism deals with art not as expressive but asimpressive purely.ERNEST. But is that really so?GILBERT. Of course it is. Who cares whether Mr. Ruskin's views onTurner are sound or not? What does it matter? That mighty andmajestic prose of his, so fervid and so fiery-coloured in its nobleeloquence, so rich in its elaborate symphonic music, so sure andcertain, at its best, in subtle choice of word and epithet, is atleast as great a work of art as any of those wonderful sunsets thatbleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in England's Gallery;greater indeed, one is apt to think at times, not merely becauseits equal beauty is more enduring, but on account of the fullervariety of its appeal, soul speaking to soul in those long-cadencedlines, not through form and colour alone, though through these,indeed, completely and without loss, but with intellectual andemotional utterance, with lofty passion and with loftier thought,with imaginative insight, and with poetic aim; greater, I alwaysthink, even as Literature is the greater art. Who, again, careswhether Mr. Pater has put into the portrait of Monna Lisa somethingthat Lionardo never dreamed of? The painter may have been merelythe slave of an archaic smile, as some have fancied, but whenever Ipass into the cool galleries of the Palace of the Louvre, and standbefore that strange figure 'set in its marble chair in that cirqueof fantastic rocks, as in some faint light under sea,' I murmur tomyself, 'She is older than the rocks among which she sits; like thevampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets ofthe grave; and has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps theirfallen day about her: and trafficked for strange webs with Easternmerchants; and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, asSt. Anne, the mother of Mary; and all this has been to her but asthe sound of lyres and flutes, and lives only in the delicacy withwhich it has moulded the changing lineaments, and tinged theeyelids and the hands.' And I say to my friend, 'The presence thatthus so strangely rose beside the waters is expressive of what inthe ways of a thousand years man had come to desire'; and heanswers me, 'Hers is the head upon which all "the ends of the worldare come," and the eyelids are a little weary.'And so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is,and reveals to us a secret of which, in truth, it knows nothing,and the music of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as wasthat flute-player's music that lent to the lips of La Giocondathose subtle and poisonous curves. Do you ask me what Lionardowould have said had any one told him of this picture that 'all thethoughts and experience of the world had etched and moulded thereinthat which they had of power to refine and make expressive theoutward form, the animalism of Greece, the lust of Rome, thereverie of the Middle Age with its spiritual ambition andimaginative loves, the return of the Pagan world, the sins of theBorgias?' He would probably have answered that he had contemplatednone of these things, but had concerned himself simply with certainarrangements of lines and masses, and with new and curious colour-harmonies of blue and green. And it is for this very reason thatthe criticism which I have quoted is criticism of the highest kind.It treats the work of art simply as a starting-point for a newcreation. It does not confine itself--let us at least suppose sofor the moment--to discovering the real intention of the artist andaccepting that as final. And in this it is right, for the meaningof any beautiful created thing is, at least, as much in the soul ofhim who looks at it, as it was in his soul who wrought it. Nay, itis rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriadmeanings, and makes it marvellous for us, and sets it in some newrelation to the age, so that it becomes a vital portion of ourlives, and a symbol of what we pray for, or perhaps of what, havingprayed for, we fear that we may receive. The longer I study,Ernest, the more clearly I see that the beauty of the visible artsis, as the beauty of music, impressive primarily, and that it maybe marred, and indeed often is so, by any excess of intellectualintention on the part of the artist. For when the work is finishedit has, as it were, an independent life of its own, and may delivera message far other than that which was put into its lips to say.Sometimes, when I listen to the overture to Tannhauser, I seemindeed to see that comely knight treading delicately on the flower-strewn grass, and to hear the voice of Venus calling to him fromthe caverned hill. But at other times it speaks to me of athousand different things, of myself, it may be, and my own life,or of the lives of others whom one has loved and grown weary ofloving, or of the passions that man has known, or of the passionsthat man has not known, and so has sought for. To-night it mayfill one with that ??OS ?O? ??????O?, that Amour de l'Impossible,which falls like a madness on many who think they live securely andout of reach of harm, so that they sicken suddenly with the poisonof unlimited desire, and, in the infinite pursuit of what they maynot obtain, grow faint and swoon or stumble. To-morrow, like themusic of which Aristotle and Plato tell us, the noble Dorian musicof the Greek, it may perform the office of a physician, and give usan anodyne against pain, and heal the spirit that is wounded, and'bring the soul into harmony with all right things.' And what istrue about music is true about all the arts. Beauty has as manymeanings as man has moods. Beauty is the symbol of symbols.Beauty reveals everything, because it expresses nothing. When itshows us itself, it shows us the whole fiery-coloured world.ERNEST. But is such work as you have talked about reallycriticism?GILBERT. It is the highest Criticism, for it criticises not merelythe individual work of art, but Beauty itself, and fills withwonder a form which the artist may have left void, or notunderstood, or understood incompletely.ERNEST. The highest Criticism, then, is more creative thancreation, and the primary aim of the critic is to see the object asin itself it really is not; that is your theory, I believe?GILBERT. Yes, that is my theory. To the critic the work of art issimply a suggestion for a new work of his own, that need notnecessarily bear any obvious resemblance to the thing itcriticises. The one characteristic of a beautiful form is that onecan put into it whatever one wishes, and see in it whatever onechooses to see; and the Beauty, that gives to creation itsuniversal and aesthetic element, makes the critic a creator in histurn, and whispers of a thousand different things which were notpresent in the mind of him who carved the statue or painted thepanel or graved the gem.It is sometimes said by those who understand neither the nature ofthe highest Criticism nor the charm of the highest Art, that thepictures that the critic loves most to write about are those thatbelong to the anecdotage of painting, and that deal with scenestaken out of literature or history. But this is not so. Indeed,pictures of this kind are far too intelligible. As a class, theyrank with illustrations, and, even considered from this point ofview are failures, as they do not stir the imagination, but setdefinite bounds to it. For the domain of the painter is, as Isuggested before, widely different from that of the poet. To thelatter belongs life in its full and absolute entirety; not merelythe beauty that men look at, but the beauty that men listen toalso; not merely the momentary grace of form or the transientgladness of colour, but the whole sphere of feeling, the perfectcycle of thought. The painter is so far limited that it is onlythrough the mask of the body that he can show us the mystery of thesoul; only through conventional images that he can handle ideas;only through its physical equivalents that he can deal withpsychology. And how inadequately does he do it then, asking us toaccept the torn turban of the Moor for the noble rage of Othello,or a dotard in a storm for the wild madness of Lear! Yet it seemsas if nothing could stop him. Most of our elderly English paintersspend their wicked and wasted lives in poaching upon the domain ofthe poets, marring their motives by clumsy treatment, and strivingto render, by visible form or colour, the marvel of what isinvisible, the splendour of what is not seen. Their pictures are,as a natural consequence, insufferably tedious. They have degradedthe invisible arts into the obvious arts, and the one thing notworth looking at is the obvious. I do not say that poet andpainter may not treat of the same subject. They have always doneso and will always do so. But while the poet can be pictorial ornot, as he chooses, the painter must be pictorial always. For apainter is limited, not to what he sees in nature, but to what uponcanvas may be seen.And so, my dear Ernest, pictures of this kind will not reallyfascinate the critic. He will turn from them to such works as makehim brood and dream and fancy, to works that possess the subtlequality of suggestion, and seem to tell one that even from themthere is an escape into a wider world. It is sometimes said thatthe tragedy of an artist's life is that he cannot realise hisideal. But the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists isthat they realise their ideal too absolutely. For, when the idealis realised, it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery, andbecomes simply a new starting-point for an ideal that is other thanitself. This is the reason why music is the perfect type of art.Music can never reveal its ultimate secret. This, also, is theexplanation of the value of limitations in art. The sculptorgladly surrenders imitative colour, and the painter the actualdimensions of form, because by such renunciations they are able toavoid too definite a presentation of the Real, which would be mereimitation, and too definite a realisation of the Ideal, which wouldbe too purely intellectual. It is through its very incompletenessthat art becomes complete in beauty, and so addresses itself, notto the faculty of recognition nor to the faculty of reason, but tothe aesthetic sense alone, which, while accepting both reason andrecognition as stages of apprehension, subordinates them both to apure synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole, and,taking whatever alien emotional elements the work may possess, usestheir very complexity as a means by which a richer unity may beadded to the ultimate impression itself. You see, then, how it isthat the aesthetic critic rejects these obvious modes of art thathave but one message to deliver, and having delivered it becomedumb and sterile, and seeks rather for such modes as suggestreverie and mood, and by their imaginative beauty make allinterpretations true, and no interpretation final. Someresemblance, no doubt, the creative work of the critic will have tothe work that has stirred him to creation, but it will be suchresemblance as exists, not between Nature and the mirror that thepainter of landscape or figure may be supposed to hold up to her,but between Nature and the work of the decorative artist. Just ason the flowerless carpets of Persia, tulip and rose blossom indeedand are lovely to look on, though they are not reproduced invisible shape or line; just as the pearl and purple of the sea-shell is echoed in the church of St. Mark at Venice; just as thevaulted ceiling of the wondrous chapel at Ravenna is made gorgeousby the gold and green and sapphire of the peacock's tail, thoughthe birds of Juno fly not across it; so the critic reproduces thework that he criticises in a mode that is never imitative, and partof whose charm may really consist in the rejection of resemblance,and shows us in this way not merely the meaning but also themystery of Beauty, and, by transforming each art into literature,solves once for all the problem of Art's unity.But I see it is time for supper. After we have discussed someChambertin and a few ortolans, we will pass on to the question ofthe critic considered in the light of the interpreter.ERNEST. Ah! you admit, then, that the critic may occasionally beallowed to see the object as in itself it really is.GILBERT. I am not quite sure. Perhaps I may admit it aftersupper. There is a subtle influence in supper.THE CRITIC AS ARTIST--WITH SOME REMARKS UPON THE IMPORTANCE OFDISCUSSING EVERYTHINGA DIALOGUE: Part II. Persons: the same. Scene: the same.ERNEST. The ortolans were delightful, and the Chambertin perfect,and now let us return to the point at issue.GILBERT. Ah! don't let us do that. Conversation should toucheverything, but should concentrate itself on nothing. Let us talkabout Moral Indignation, its Cause and Cure, a subject on which Ithink of writing: or about The Survival of Thersites, as shown bythe English comic papers; or about any topic that may turn up.ERNEST. No; I want to discuss the critic and criticism. You havetold me that the highest criticism deals with art, not asexpressive, but as impressive purely, and is consequently bothcreative and independent, is in fact an art by itself, occupyingthe same relation to creative work that creative work does to thevisible world of form and colour, or the unseen world of passionand of thought. Well, now, tell me, will not the critic besometimes a real interpreter?GILBERT. Yes; the critic will be an interpreter, if he chooses.He can pass from his synthetic impression of the work of art as awhole, to an analysis or exposition of the work itself, and in thislower sphere, as I hold it to be, there are many delightful thingsto be said and done. Yet his object will not always be to explainthe work of art. He may seek rather to deepen its mystery, toraise round it, and round its maker, that mist of wonder which isdear to both gods and worshippers alike. Ordinary people are'terribly at ease in Zion.' They propose to walk arm in arm withthe poets, and have a glib ignorant way of saying, 'Why should weread what is written about Shakespeare and Milton? We can read theplays and the poems. That is enough.' But an appreciation ofMilton is, as the late Rector of Lincoln remarked once, the rewardof consummate scholarship. And he who desires to understandShakespeare truly must understand the relations in whichShakespeare stood to the Renaissance and the Reformation, to theage of Elizabeth and the age of James; he must be familiar with thehistory of the struggle for supremacy between the old classicalforms and the new spirit of romance, between the school of Sidney,and Daniel, and Johnson, and the school of Marlowe and Marlowe'sgreater son; he must know the materials that were at Shakespeare'sdisposal, and the method in which he used them, and the conditionsof theatric presentation in the sixteenth and seventeenth century,their limitations and their opportunities for freedom, and theliterary criticism of Shakespeare's day, its aims and modes andcanons; he must study the English language in its progress, andblank or rhymed verse in its various developments; he must studythe Greek drama, and the connection between the art of the creatorof the Agamemnon and the art of the creator of Macbeth; in a word,he must be able to bind Elizabethan London to the Athens ofPericles, and to learn Shakespeare's true position in the historyof European drama and the drama of the world. The critic willcertainly be an interpreter, but he will not treat Art as ariddling Sphinx, whose shallow secret may be guessed and revealedby one whose feet are wounded and who knows not his name. Rather,he will look upon Art as a goddess whose mystery it is his provinceto intensify, and whose majesty his privilege to make moremarvellous in the eyes of men.And here, Ernest, this strange thing happens. The critic willindeed be an interpreter, but he will not be an interpreter in thesense of one who simply repeats in another form a message that hasbeen put into his lips to say. For, just as it is only by contactwith the art of foreign nations that the art of a country gainsthat individual and separate life that we call nationality, so, bycurious inversion, it is only by intensifying his own personalitythat the critic can interpret the personality and work of others,and the more strongly this personality enters into theinterpretation the more real the interpretation becomes, the moresatisfying, the more convincing, and the more true.ERNEST. I would have said that personality would have been adisturbing element.GILBERT. No; it is an element of revelation. If you wish tounderstand others you must intensify your own individualism.ERNEST. What, then, is the result?GILBERT. I will tell you, and perhaps I can tell you best bydefinite example. It seems to me that, while the literary criticstands of course first, as having the wider range, and largervision, and nobler material, each of the arts has a critic, as itwere, assigned to it. The actor is a critic of the drama. Heshows the poet's work under new conditions, and by a method specialto himself. He takes the written word, and action, gesture andvoice become the media of revelation. The singer or the player onlute and viol is the critic of music. The etcher of a picture robsthe painting of its fair colours, but shows us by the use of a newmaterial its true colour-quality, its tones and values, and therelations of its masses, and so is, in his way, a critic of it, forthe critic is he who exhibits to us a work of art in a formdifferent from that of the work itself, and the employment of a newmaterial is a critical as well as a creative element. Sculpture,too, has its critic, who may be either the carver of a gem, as hewas in Greek days, or some painter like Mantegna, who sought toreproduce on canvas the beauty of plastic line and the symphonicdignity of processional bas-relief. And in the case of all thesecreative critics of art it is evident that personality is anabsolute essential for any real interpretation. When Rubinsteinplays to us the Sonata Appassionata of Beethoven, he gives us notmerely Beethoven, but also himself, and so gives us Beethovenabsolutely--Beethoven re-interpreted through a rich artisticnature, and made vivid and wonderful to us by a new and intensepersonality. When a great actor plays Shakespeare we have the sameexperience. His own individuality becomes a vital part of theinterpretation. People sometimes say that actors give us their ownHamlets, and not Shakespeare's; and this fallacy--for it is afallacy--is, I regret to say, repeated by that charming andgraceful writer who has lately deserted the turmoil of literaturefor the peace of the House of Commons, I mean the author of ObiterDicta. In point of fact, there is no such thing as Shakespeare'sHamlet. If Hamlet has something of the definiteness of a work ofart, he has also all the obscurity that belongs to life. There areas many Hamlets as there are melancholies.ERNEST. As many Hamlets as there are melancholies?GILBERT. Yes: and as art springs from personality, so it is onlyto personality that it can be revealed, and from the meeting of thetwo comes right interpretative criticism.ERNEST. The critic, then, considered as the interpreter, will giveno less than he receives, and lend as much as he borrows?GILBERT. He will be always showing us the work of art in some newrelation to our age. He will always be reminding us that greatworks of art are living things--are, in fact, the only things thatlive. So much, indeed, will he feel this, that I am certain that,as civilisation progresses and we become more highly organised, theelect spirits of each age, the critical and cultured spirits, willgrow less and less interested in actual life, and WILL SEEK TO GAINTHEIR IMPRESSIONS ALMOST ENTIRELY FROM WHAT ART HAS TOUCHED. Forlife is terribly deficient in form. Its catastrophes happen in thewrong way and to the wrong people. There is a grotesque horrorabout its comedies, and its tragedies seem to culminate in farce.One is always wounded when one approaches it. Things last eithertoo long, or not long enough.ERNEST. Poor life! Poor human life! Are you not even touched bythe tears that the Roman poet tells us are part of its essence.GILBERT. Too quickly touched by them, I fear. For when one looksback upon the life that was so vivid in its emotional intensity,and filled with such fervent moments of ecstasy or of joy, it allseems to be a dream and an illusion. What are the unreal things,but the passions that once burned one like fire? What are theincredible things, but the things that one has faithfully believed?What are the improbable things? The things that one has doneoneself. No, Ernest; life cheats us with shadows, like a puppet-master. We ask it for pleasure. It gives it to us, withbitterness and disappointment in its train. We come across somenoble grief that we think will lend the purple dignity of tragedyto our days, but it passes away from us, and things less noble takeits place, and on some grey windy dawn, or odorous eve of silenceand of silver, we find ourselves looking with callous wonder, ordull heart of stone, at the tress of gold-flecked hair that we hadonce so wildly worshipped and so madly kissed.ERNEST. Life then is a failure?GILBERT. From the artistic point of view, certainly. And thechief thing that makes life a failure from this artistic point ofview is the thing that lends to life its sordid security, the factthat one can never repeat exactly the same emotion. How differentit is in the world of Art! On a shelf of the bookcase behind youstands the Divine Comedy, and I know that, if I open it at acertain place, I shall be filled with a fierce hatred of some onewho has never wronged me, or stirred by a great love for some onewhom I shall never see. There is no mood or passion that Artcannot give us, and those of us who have discovered her secret cansettle beforehand what our experiences are going to be. We canchoose our day and select our hour. We can say to ourselves, 'To-morrow, at dawn, we shall walk with grave Virgil through the valleyof the shadow of death,' and lo! the dawn finds us in the obscurewood, and the Mantuan stands by our side. We pass through the gateof the legend fatal to hope, and with pity or with joy behold thehorror of another world. The hypocrites go by, with their paintedfaces and their cowls of gilded lead. Out of the ceaseless windsthat drive them, the carnal look at us, and we watch the hereticrending his flesh, and the glutton lashed by the rain. We breakthe withered branches from the tree in the grove of the Harpies,and each dull-hued poisonous twig bleeds with red blood before us,and cries aloud with bitter cries. Out of a horn of fire Odysseusspeaks to us, and when from his sepulchre of flame the greatGhibelline rises, the pride that triumphs over the torture of thatbed becomes ours for a moment. Through the dim purple air flythose who have stained the world with the beauty of their sin, andin the pit of loathsome disease, dropsy-stricken and swollen ofbody into the semblance of a monstrous lute, lies Adamo di Brescia,the coiner of false coin. He bids us listen to his misery; westop, and with dry and gaping lips he tells us how he dreams dayand night of the brooks of clear water that in cool dewy channelsgush down the green Casentine hills. Sinon, the false Greek ofTroy, mocks at him. He smites him in the face, and they wrangle.We are fascinated by their shame, and loiter, till Virgil chides usand leads us away to that city turreted by giants where greatNimrod blows his horn. Terrible things are in store for us, and wego to meet them in Dante's raiment and with Dante's heart. Wetraverse the marshes of the Styx, and Argenti swims to the boatthrough the slimy waves. He calls to us, and we reject him. Whenwe hear the voice of his agony we are glad, and Virgil praises usfor the bitterness of our scorn. We tread upon the cold crystal ofCocytus, in which traitors stick like straws in glass. Our footstrikes against the head of Bocca. He will not tell us his name,and we tear the hair in handfuls from the screaming skull.Alberigo prays us to break the ice upon his face that he may weep alittle. We pledge our word to him, and when he has uttered hisdolorous tale we deny the word that we have spoken, and pass fromhim; such cruelty being courtesy indeed, for who more base than hewho has mercy for the condemned of God? In the jaws of Lucifer wesee the man who sold Christ, and in the jaws of Lucifer the men whoslew Caesar. We tremble, and come forth to re-behold the stars.In the land of Purgation the air is freer, and the holy mountainrises into the pure light of day. There is peace for us, and forthose who for a season abide in it there is some peace also,though, pale from the poison of the Maremma, Madonna Pia passesbefore us, and Ismene, with the sorrow of earth still lingeringabout her, is there. Soul after soul makes us share in somerepentance or some joy. He whom the mourning of his widow taughtto drink the sweet wormwood of pain, tells us of Nella praying inher lonely bed, and we learn from the mouth of Buonconte how asingle tear may save a dying sinner from the fiend. Sordello, thatnoble and disdainful Lombard, eyes us from afar like a couchantlion. When he learns that Virgil is one of Mantua's citizens, hefalls upon his neck, and when he learns that he is the singer ofRome he falls before his feet. In that valley whose grass andflowers are fairer than cleft emerald and Indian wood, and brighterthan scarlet and silver, they are singing who in the world werekings; but the lips of Rudolph of Hapsburg do not move to the musicof the others, and Philip of France beats his breast and Henry ofEngland sits alone. On and on we go, climbing the marvellousstair, and the stars become larger than their wont, and the song ofthe kings grows faint, and at length we reach the seven trees ofgold and the garden of the Earthly Paradise. In a griffin-drawnchariot appears one whose brows are bound with olive, who is veiledin white, and mantled in green, and robed in a vesture that iscoloured like live fire. The ancient flame wakes within us. Ourblood quickens through terrible pulses. We recognise her. It isBeatrice, the woman we have worshipped. The ice congealed aboutour heart melts. Wild tears of anguish break from us, and we bowour forehead to the ground, for we know that we have sinned. Whenwe have done penance, and are purified, and have drunk of thefountain of Lethe and bathed in the fountain of Eunoe, the mistressof our soul raises us to the Paradise of Heaven. Out of thateternal pearl, the moon, the face of Piccarda Donati leans to us.Her beauty troubles us for a moment, and when, like a thing thatfalls through water, she passes away, we gaze after her withwistful eyes. The sweet planet of Venus is full of lovers.Cunizza, the sister of Ezzelin, the lady of Sordello's heart, isthere, and Folco, the passionate singer of Provence, who in sorrowfor Azalais forsook the world, and the Canaanitish harlot whosesoul was the first that Christ redeemed. Joachim of Flora standsin the sun, and, in the sun, Aquinas recounts the story of St.Francis and Bonaventure the story of St. Dominic. Through theburning rubies of Mars, Cacciaguida approaches. He tells us of thearrow that is shot from the bow of exile, and how salt tastes thebread of another, and how steep are the stairs in the house of astranger. In Saturn the soul sings not, and even she who guides usdare not smile. On a ladder of gold the flames rise and fall. Atlast, we see the pageant of the Mystical Rose. Beatrice fixes hereyes upon the face of God to turn them not again. The beatificvision is granted to us; we know the Love that moves the sun andall the stars.Yes, we can put the earth back six hundred courses and makeourselves one with the great Florentine, kneel at the same altarwith him, and share his rapture and his scorn. And if we growtired of an antique time, and desire to realise our own age in allits weariness and sin, are there not books that can make us livemore in one single hour than life can make us live in a score ofshameful years? Close to your hand lies a little volume, bound insome Nile-green skin that has been powdered with gilded nenupharsand smoothed with hard ivory. It is the book that Gautier loved,it is Baudelaire's masterpiece. Open it at that sad madrigal thatbeginsQue m'importe que tu sois sage?Sois belle! et sois triste!and you will find yourself worshipping sorrow as you have neverworshipped joy. Pass on to the poem on the man who tortureshimself, let its subtle music steal into your brain and colour yourthoughts, and you will become for a moment what he was who wroteit; nay, not for a moment only, but for many barren moonlit nightsand sunless sterile days will a despair that is not your own makeits dwelling within you, and the misery of another gnaw your heartaway. Read the whole book, suffer it to tell even one of itssecrets to your soul, and your soul will grow eager to know more,and will feed upon poisonous honey, and seek to repent of strangecrimes of which it is guiltless, and to make atonement for terriblepleasures that it has never known. And then, when you are tired ofthese flowers of evil, turn to the flowers that grow in the gardenof Perdita, and in their dew-drenched chalices cool your feveredbrow, and let their loveliness heal and restore your soul; or wakefrom his forgotten tomb the sweet Syrian, Meleager, and bid thelover of Heliodore make you music, for he too has flowers in hissong, red pomegranate blossoms, and irises that smell of myrrh,ringed daffodils and dark blue hyacinths, and marjoram and crinkledox-eyes. Dear to him was the perfume of the bean-field at evening,and dear to him the odorous eared-spikenard that grew on the Syrianhills, and the fresh green thyme, the wine-cup's charm. The feetof his love as she walked in the garden were like lilies set uponlilies. Softer than sleep-laden poppy petals were her lips, softerthan violets and as scented. The flame-like crocus sprang from thegrass to look at her. For her the slim narcissus stored the coolrain; and for her the anemones forgot the Sicilian winds that wooedthem. And neither crocus, nor anemone, nor narcissus was as fairas she was.It is a strange thing, this transference of emotion. We sickenwith the same maladies as the poets, and the singer lends us hispain. Dead lips have their message for us, and hearts that havefallen to dust can communicate their joy. We run to kiss thebleeding mouth of Fantine, and we follow Manon Lescaut over thewhole world. Ours is the love-madness of the Tyrian, and theterror of Orestes is ours also. There is no passion that we cannotfeel, no pleasure that we may not gratify, and we can choose thetime of our initiation and the time of our freedom also. Life!Life! Don't let us go to life for our fulfilment or ourexperience. It is a thing narrowed by circumstances, incoherent inits utterance, and without that fine correspondence of form andspirit which is the only thing that can satisfy the artistic andcritical temperament. It makes us pay too high a price for itswares, and we purchase the meanest of its secrets at a cost that ismonstrous and infinite.ERNEST. Must we go, then, to Art for everything?GILBERT. For everything. Because Art does not hurt us. The tearsthat we shed at a play are a type of the exquisite sterile emotionsthat it is the function of Art to awaken. We weep, but we are notwounded. We grieve, but our grief is not bitter. In the actuallife of man, sorrow, as Spinoza says somewhere, is a passage to alesser perfection. But the sorrow with which Art fills us bothpurifies and initiates, if I may quote once more from the great artcritic of the Greeks. It is through Art, and through Art only,that we can realise our perfection; through Art, and through Artonly, that we can shield ourselves from the sordid perils of actualexistence. This results not merely from the fact that nothing thatone can imagine is worth doing, and that one can imagineeverything, but from the subtle law that emotional forces, like theforces of the physical sphere, are limited in extent and energy.One can feel so much, and no more. And how can it matter with whatpleasure life tries to tempt one, or with what pain it seeks tomaim and mar one's soul, if in the spectacle of the lives of thosewho have never existed one has found the true secret of joy, andwept away one's tears over their deaths who, like Cordelia and thedaughter of Brabantio, can never die?ERNEST. Stop a moment. It seems to me that in everything that youhave said there is something radically immoral.GILBERT. All art is immoral.ERNEST. All art?GILBERT. Yes. For emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim ofart, and emotion for the sake of action is the aim of life, and ofthat practical organisation of life that we call society. Society,which is the beginning and basis of morals, exists simply for theconcentration of human energy, and in order to ensure its owncontinuance and healthy stability it demands, and no doubt rightlydemands, of each of its citizens that he should contribute someform of productive labour to the common weal, and toil and travailthat the day's work may be done. Society often forgives thecriminal; it never forgives the dreamer. The beautiful sterileemotions that art excites in us are hateful in its eyes, and socompletely are people dominated by the tyranny of this dreadfulsocial ideal that they are always coming shamelessly up to one atPrivate Views and other places that are open to the general public,and saying in a loud stentorian voice, 'What are you doing?'whereas 'What are you thinking?' is the only question that anysingle civilised being should ever be allowed to whisper toanother. They mean well, no doubt, these honest beaming folk.Perhaps that is the reason why they are so excessively tedious.But some one should teach them that while, in the opinion ofsociety, Contemplation is the gravest sin of which any citizen canbe guilty, in the opinion of the highest culture it is the properoccupation of man.ERNEST. Contemplation?GILBERT. Contemplation. I said to you some time ago that it wasfar more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it. Let me sayto you now that to do nothing at all is the most difficult thing inthe world, the most difficult and the most intellectual. To Plato,with his passion for wisdom, this was the noblest form of energy.To Aristotle, with his passion for knowledge, this was the noblestform of energy also. It was to this that the passion for holinessled the saint and the mystic of mediaeval days.ERNEST. We exist, then, to do nothing?GILBERT. It is to do nothing that the elect exist. Action islimited and relative. Unlimited and absolute is the vision of himwho sits at ease and watches, who walks in loneliness and dreams.But we who are born at the close of this wonderful age are at oncetoo cultured and too critical, too intellectually subtle and toocurious of exquisite pleasures, to accept any speculations aboutlife in exchange for life itself. To us the citta divina iscolourless, and the fruitio Dei without meaning. Metaphysics donot satisfy our temperaments, and religious ecstasy is out of date.The world through which the Academic philosopher becomes 'thespectator of all time and of all existence' is not really an idealworld, but simply a world of abstract ideas. When we enter it, westarve amidst the chill mathematics of thought. The courts of thecity of God are not open to us now. Its gates are guarded byIgnorance, and to pass them we have to surrender all that in ournature is most divine. It is enough that our fathers believed.They have exhausted the faith-faculty of the species. Their legacyto us is the scepticism of which they were afraid. Had they put itinto words, it might not live within us as thought. No, Ernest,no. We cannot go back to the saint. There is far more to belearned from the sinner. We cannot go back to the philosopher, andthe mystic leads us astray. Who, as Mr. Pater suggests somewhere,would exchange the curve of a single rose-leaf for that formlessintangible Being which Plato rates so high? What to us is theIllumination of Philo, the Abyss of Eckhart, the Vision of Bohme,the monstrous Heaven itself that was revealed to Swedenborg'sblinded eyes? Such things are less than the yellow trumpet of onedaffodil of the field, far less than the meanest of the visiblearts, for, just as Nature is matter struggling into mind, so Art ismind expressing itself under the conditions of matter, and thus,even in the lowliest of her manifestations, she speaks to bothsense and soul alike. To the aesthetic temperament the vague isalways repellent. The Greeks were a nation of artists, becausethey were spared the sense of the infinite. Like Aristotle, likeGoethe after he had read Kant, we desire the concrete, and nothingbut the concrete can satisfy us.ERNEST. What then do you propose?GILBERT. It seems to me that with the development of the criticalspirit we shall be able to realise, not merely our own lives, butthe collective life of the race, and so to make ourselvesabsolutely modern, in the true meaning of the word modernity. Forhe to whom the present is the only thing that is present, knowsnothing of the age in which he lives. To realise the nineteenthcentury, one must realise every century that has preceded it andthat has contributed to its making. To know anything about oneselfone must know all about others. There must be no mood with whichone cannot sympathise, no dead mode of life that one cannot makealive. Is this impossible? I think not. By revealing to us theabsolute mechanism of all action, and so freeing us from the self-imposed and trammelling burden of moral responsibility, thescientific principle of Heredity has become, as it were, thewarrant for the contemplative life. It has shown us that we arenever less free than when we try to act. It has hemmed us roundwith the nets of the hunter, and written upon the wall the prophecyof our doom. We may not watch it, for it is within us. We may notsee it, save in a mirror that mirrors the soul. It is Nemesiswithout her mask. It is the last of the Fates, and the mostterrible. It is the only one of the Gods whose real name we know.And yet, while in the sphere of practical and external life it hasrobbed energy of its freedom and activity of its choice, in thesubjective sphere, where the soul is at work, it comes to us, thisterrible shadow, with many gifts in its hands, gifts of strangetemperaments and subtle susceptibilities, gifts of wild ardours andchill moods of indifference, complex multiform gifts of thoughtsthat are at variance with each other, and passions that war againstthemselves. And so, it is not our own life that we live, but thelives of the dead, and the soul that dwells within us is no singlespiritual entity, making us personal and individual, created forour service, and entering into us for our joy. It is somethingthat has dwelt in fearful places, and in ancient sepulchres hasmade its abode. It is sick with many maladies, and has memories ofcurious sins. It is wiser than we are, and its wisdom is bitter.It fills us with impossible desires, and makes us follow what weknow we cannot gain. One thing, however, Ernest, it can do for us.It can lead us away from surroundings whose beauty is dimmed to usby the mist of familiarity, or whose ignoble ugliness and sordidclaims are marring the perfection of our development. It can helpus to leave the age in which we were born, and to pass into otherages, and find ourselves not exiled from their air. It can teachus how to escape from our experience, and to realise theexperiences of those who are greater than we are. The pain ofLeopardi crying out against life becomes our pain. Theocritusblows on his pipe, and we laugh with the lips of nymph andshepherd. In the wolfskin of Pierre Vidal we flee before thehounds, and in the armour of Lancelot we ride from the bower of theQueen. We have whispered the secret of our love beneath the cowlof Abelard, and in the stained raiment of Villon have put our shameinto song. We can see the dawn through Shelley's eyes, and when wewander with Endymion the Moon grows amorous of our youth. Ours isthe anguish of Atys, and ours the weak rage and noble sorrows ofthe Dane. Do you think that it is the imagination that enables usto live these countless lives? Yes: it is the imagination; andthe imagination is the result of heredity. It is simplyconcentrated race-experience.ERNEST. But where in this is the function of the critical spirit?GILBERT. The culture that this transmission of racial experiencesmakes possible can be made perfect by the critical spirit alone,and indeed may be said to be one with it. For who is the truecritic but he who bears within himself the dreams, and ideas, andfeelings of myriad generations, and to whom no form of thought isalien, no emotional impulse obscure? And who the true man ofculture, if not he who by fine scholarship and fastidious rejectionhas made instinct self-conscious and intelligent, and can separatethe work that has distinction from the work that has it not, and soby contact and comparison makes himself master of the secrets ofstyle and school, and understands their meanings, and listens totheir voices, and develops that spirit of disinterested curiositywhich is the real root, as it is the real flower, of theintellectual life, and thus attains to intellectual clarity, and,having learned 'the best that is known and thought in the world,'lives--it is not fanciful to say so--with those who are theImmortals.Yes, Ernest: the contemplative life, the life that has for its aimnot DOING but BEING, and not BEING merely, but BECOMING--that iswhat the critical spirit can give us. The gods live thus: eitherbrooding over their own perfection, as Aristotle tells us, or, asEpicurus fancied, watching with the calm eyes of the spectator thetragicomedy of the world that they have made. We, too, might livelike them, and set ourselves to witness with appropriate emotionsthe varied scenes that man and nature afford. We might makeourselves spiritual by detaching ourselves from action, and becomeperfect by the rejection of energy. It has often seemed to me thatBrowning felt something of this. Shakespeare hurls Hamlet intoactive life, and makes him realise his mission by effort. Browningmight have given us a Hamlet who would have realised his mission bythought. Incident and event were to him unreal or unmeaning. Hemade the soul the protagonist of life's tragedy, and looked onaction as the one undramatic element of a play. To us, at anyrate, the [Greek text which cannot be reproduced] is the trueideal. From the high tower of Thought we can look out at theworld. Calm, and self-centred, and complete, the aesthetic criticcontemplates life, and no arrow drawn at a venture can piercebetween the joints of his harness. He at least is safe. He hasdiscovered how to live.Is such a mode of life immoral? Yes: all the arts are immoral,except those baser forms of sensual or didactic art that seek toexcite to action of evil or of good. For action of every kindbelongs to the sphere of ethics. The aim of art is simply tocreate a mood. Is such a mode of life unpractical? Ah! it is notso easy to be unpractical as the ignorant Philistine imagines. Itwere well for England if it were so. There is no country in theworld so much in need of unpractical people as this country ofours. With us, Thought is degraded by its constant associationwith practice. Who that moves in the stress and turmoil of actualexistence, noisy politician, or brawling social reformer, or poornarrow-minded priest blinded by the sufferings of that unimportantsection of the community among whom he has cast his lot, canseriously claim to be able to form a disinterested intellectualjudgment about any one thing? Each of the professions means aprejudice. The necessity for a career forces every one to takesides. We live in the age of the overworked, and the under-educated; the age in which people are so industrious that theybecome absolutely stupid. And, harsh though it may sound, I cannothelp saying that such people deserve their doom. The sure way ofknowing nothing about life is to try to make oneself useful.ERNEST. A charming doctrine, Gilbert.GILBERT. I am not sure about that, but it has at least the minormerit of being true. That the desire to do good to others producesa plentiful crop of prigs is the least of the evils of which it isthe cause. The prig is a very interesting psychological study, andthough of all poses a moral pose is the most offensive, still tohave a pose at all is something. It is a formal recognition of theimportance of treating life from a definite and reasonedstandpoint. That Humanitarian Sympathy wars against Nature, bysecuring the survival of the failure, may make the man of scienceloathe its facile virtues. The political economist may cry outagainst it for putting the improvident on the same level as theprovident, and so robbing life of the strongest, because mostsordid, incentive to industry. But, in the eyes of the thinker,the real harm that emotional sympathy does is that it limitsknowledge, and so prevents us from solving any single socialproblem. We are trying at present to stave off the coming crisis,the coming revolution as my friends the Fabianists call it, bymeans of doles and alms. Well, when the revolution or crisisarrives, we shall be powerless, because we shall know nothing. Andso, Ernest, let us not be deceived. England will never becivilised till she has added Utopia to her dominions. There ismore than one of her colonies that she might with advantagesurrender for so fair a land. What we want are unpractical peoplewho see beyond the moment, and think beyond the day. Those who tryto lead the people can only do so by following the mob. It isthrough the voice of one crying in the wilderness that the ways ofthe gods must be prepared.But perhaps you think that in beholding for the mere joy ofbeholding, and contemplating for the sake of contemplation, thereis something that is egotistic. If you think so, do not say so.It takes a thoroughly selfish age, like our own, to deify self-sacrifice. It takes a thoroughly grasping age, such as that inwhich we live, to set above the fine intellectual virtues, thoseshallow and emotional virtues that are an immediate practicalbenefit to itself. They miss their aim, too, these philanthropistsand sentimentalists of our day, who are always chattering to oneabout one's duty to one's neighbour. For the development of therace depends on the development of the individual, and where self-culture has ceased to be the ideal, the intellectual standard isinstantly lowered, and, often, ultimately lost. If you meet atdinner a man who has spent his life in educating himself--a raretype in our time, I admit, but still one occasionally to be metwith--you rise from table richer, and conscious that a high idealhas for a moment touched and sanctified your days. But oh! my dearErnest, to sit next to a man who has spent his life in trying toeducate others! What a dreadful experience that is! How appallingis that ignorance which is the inevitable result of the fatal habitof imparting opinions! How limited in range the creature's mindproves to be! How it wearies us, and must weary himself, with itsendless repetitions and sickly reiteration! How lacking it is inany element of intellectual growth! In what a vicious circle italways moves!ERNEST. You speak with strange feeling, Gilbert. Have you hadthis dreadful experience, as you call it, lately?GILBERT. Few of us escape it. People say that the schoolmaster isabroad. I wish to goodness he were. But the type of which, afterall, he is only one, and certainly the least important, of therepresentatives, seems to me to be really dominating our lives; andjust as the philanthropist is the nuisance of the ethical sphere,so the nuisance of the intellectual sphere is the man who is sooccupied in trying to educate others, that he has never had anytime to educate himself. No, Ernest, self-culture is the trueideal of man. Goethe saw it, and the immediate debt that we owe toGoethe is greater than the debt we owe to any man since Greek days.The Greeks saw it, and have left us, as their legacy to modernthought, the conception of the contemplative life as well as thecritical method by which alone can that life be truly realised. Itwas the one thing that made the Renaissance great, and gave usHumanism. It is the one thing that could make our own age greatalso; for the real weakness of England lies, not in incompletearmaments or unfortified coasts, not in the poverty that creepsthrough sunless lanes, or the drunkenness that brawls in loathsomecourts, but simply in the fact that her ideals are emotional andnot intellectual.I do not deny that the intellectual ideal is difficult ofattainment, still less that it is, and perhaps will be for years tocome, unpopular with the crowd. It is so easy for people to havesympathy with suffering. It is so difficult for them to havesympathy with thought. Indeed, so little do ordinary peopleunderstand what thought really is, that they seem to imagine that,when they have said that a theory is dangerous, they havepronounced its condemnation, whereas it is only such theories thathave any true intellectual value. An idea that is not dangerous isunworthy of being called an idea at all.ERNEST. Gilbert, you bewilder me. You have told me that all artis, in its essence, immoral. Are you going to tell me now that allthought is, in its essence, dangerous?GILBERT. Yes, in the practical sphere it is so. The security ofsociety lies in custom and unconscious instinct, and the basis ofthe stability of society, as a healthy organism, is the completeabsence of any intelligence amongst its members. The greatmajority of people being fully aware of this, rank themselvesnaturally on the side of that splendid system that elevates them tothe dignity of machines, and rage so wildly against the intrusionof the intellectual faculty into any question that concerns life,that one is tempted to define man as a rational animal who alwaysloses his temper when he is called upon to act in accordance withthe dictates of reason. But let us turn from the practical sphere,and say no more about the wicked philanthropists, who, indeed, maywell be left to the mercy of the almond-eyed sage of the YellowRiver Chuang Tsu the wise, who has proved that such well-meaningand offensive busybodies have destroyed the simple and spontaneousvirtue that there is in man. They are a wearisome topic, and I amanxious to get back to the sphere in which criticism is free.ERNEST. The sphere of the intellect?GILBERT. Yes. You remember that I spoke of the critic as being inhis own way as creative as the artist, whose work, indeed, may bemerely of value in so far as it gives to the critic a suggestionfor some new mood of thought and feeling which he can realise withequal, or perhaps greater, distinction of form, and, through theuse of a fresh medium of expression, make differently beautiful andmore perfect. Well, you seemed to be a little sceptical about thetheory. But perhaps I wronged you?ERNEST. I am not really sceptical about it, but I must admit thatI feel very strongly that such work as you describe the criticproducing--and creative such work must undoubtedly be admitted tobe--is, of necessity, purely subjective, whereas the greatest workis objective always, objective and impersonal.GILBERT. The difference between objective and subjective work isone of external form merely. It is accidental, not essential. Allartistic creation is absolutely subjective. The very landscapethat Corot looked at was, as he said himself, but a mood of his ownmind; and those great figures of Greek or English drama that seemto us to possess an actual existence of their own, apart from thepoets who shaped and fashioned them, are, in their ultimateanalysis, simply the poets themselves, not as they thought theywere, but as they thought they were not; and by such thinking camein strange manner, though but for a moment, really so to be. Forout of ourselves we can never pass, nor can there be in creationwhat in the creator was not. Nay, I would say that the moreobjective a creation appears to be, the more subjective it reallyis. Shakespeare might have met Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in thewhite streets of London, or seen the serving-men of rival housesbite their thumbs at each other in the open square; but Hamlet cameout of his soul, and Romeo out of his passion. They were elementsof his nature to which he gave visible form, impulses that stirredso strongly within him that he had, as it were perforce, to sufferthem to realise their energy, not on the lower plane of actuallife, where they would have been trammelled and constrained and somade imperfect, but on that imaginative plane of art where Love canindeed find in Death its rich fulfilment, where one can stab theeavesdropper behind the arras, and wrestle in a new-made grave, andmake a guilty king drink his own hurt, and see one's father'sspirit, beneath the glimpses of the moon, stalking in completesteel from misty wall to wall. Action being limited would haveleft Shakespeare unsatisfied and unexpressed; and, just as it isbecause he did nothing that he has been able to achieve everything,so it is because he never speaks to us of himself in his plays thathis plays reveal him to us absolutely, and show us his true natureand temperament far more completely than do those strange andexquisite sonnets, even, in which he bares to crystal eyes thesecret closet of his heart. Yes, the objective form is the mostsubjective in matter. Man is least himself when he talks in hisown person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth.ERNEST. The critic, then, being limited to the subjective form,will necessarily be less able fully to express himself than theartist, who has always at his disposal the forms that areimpersonal and objective.GILBERT. Not necessarily, and certainly not at all if herecognises that each mode of criticism is, in its highestdevelopment, simply a mood, and that we are never more true toourselves than when we are inconsistent. The aesthetic critic,constant only to the principle of beauty in all things, will everbe looking for fresh impressions, winning from the various schoolsthe secret of their charm, bowing, it may be, before foreignaltars, or smiling, if it be his fancy, at strange new gods. Whatother people call one's past has, no doubt, everything to do withthem, but has absolutely nothing to do with oneself. The man whoregards his past is a man who deserves to have no future to lookforward to. When one has found expression for a mood, one has donewith it. You laugh; but believe me it is so. Yesterday it wasRealism that charmed one. One gained from it that nouveau frissonwhich it was its aim to produce. One analysed it, explained it,and wearied of it. At sunset came the Luministe in painting, andthe Symboliste in poetry, and the spirit of mediaevalism, thatspirit which belongs not to time but to temperament, woke suddenlyin wounded Russia, and stirred us for a moment by the terriblefascination of pain. To-day the cry is for Romance, and alreadythe leaves are tremulous in the valley, and on the purple hill-topswalks Beauty with slim gilded feet. The old modes of creationlinger, of course. The artists reproduce either themselves or eachother, with wearisome iteration. But Criticism is always movingon, and the critic is always developing.Nor, again, is the critic really limited to the subjective form ofexpression. The method of the drama is his, as well as the methodof the epos. He may use dialogue, as he did who set Milton talkingto Marvel on the nature of comedy and tragedy, and made Sidney andLord Brooke discourse on letters beneath the Penshurst oaks; oradopt narration, as Mr. Pater is fond of doing, each of whoseImaginary Portraits--is not that the title of the book?--presentsto us, under the fanciful guise of fiction, some fine and exquisitepiece of criticism, one on the painter Watteau, another on thephilosophy of Spinoza, a third on the Pagan elements of the earlyRenaissance, and the last, and in some respects the mostsuggestive, on the source of that Aufklarung, that enlighteningwhich dawned on Germany in the last century, and to which our ownculture owes so great a debt. Dialogue, certainly, that wonderfulliterary form which, from Plato to Lucian, and from Lucian toGiordano Bruno, and from Bruno to that grand old Pagan in whomCarlyle took such delight, the creative critics of the world havealways employed, can never lose for the thinker its attraction as amode of expression. By its means he can both reveal and concealhimself, and give form to every fancy, and reality to every mood.By its means he can exhibit the object from each point of view, andshow it to us in the round, as a sculptor shows us things, gainingin this manner all the richness and reality of effect that comesfrom those side issues that are suddenly suggested by the centralidea in its progress, and really illumine the idea more completely,or from those felicitous after-thoughts that give a fullercompleteness to the central scheme, and yet convey something of thedelicate charm of chance.ERNEST. By its means, too, he can invent an imaginary antagonist,and convert him when he chooses by some absurdly sophisticalargument.GILBERT. Ah! it is so easy to convert others. It is so difficultto convert oneself. To arrive at what one really believes, onemust speak through lips different from one's own. To know thetruth one must imagine myriads of falsehoods. For what is Truth?In matters of religion, it is simply the opinion that has survived.In matters of science, it is the ultimate sensation. In matters ofart, it is one's last mood. And you see now, Ernest, that thecritic has at his disposal as many objective forms of expression asthe artist has. Ruskin put his criticism into imaginative prose,and is superb in his changes and contradictions; and Browning puthis into blank verse and made painter and poet yield us theirsecret; and M. Renan uses dialogue, and Mr. Pater fiction, andRossetti translated into sonnet-music the colour of Giorgione andthe design of Ingres, and his own design and colour also, feeling,with the instinct of one who had many modes of utterance; that theultimate art is literature, and the finest and fullest medium thatof words.ERNEST. Well, now that you have settled that the critic has at hisdisposal all objective forms, I wish you would tell me what are thequalities that should characterise the true critic.GILBERT. What would you say they were?ERNEST. Well, I should say that a critic should above all thingsbe fair.GILBERT. Ah! not fair. A critic cannot be fair in the ordinarysense of the word. It is only about things that do not interestone that one can give a really unbiassed opinion, which is no doubtthe reason why an unbiassed opinion is always absolutely valueless.The man who sees both sides of a question, is a man who seesabsolutely nothing at all. Art is a passion, and, in matters ofart, Thought is inevitably coloured by emotion, and so is fluidrather than fixed, and, depending upon fine moods and exquisitemoments, cannot be narrowed into the rigidity of a scientificformula or a theological dogma. It is to the soul that Art speaks,and the soul may be made the prisoner of the mind as well as of thebody. One should, of course, have no prejudices; but, as a greatFrenchman remarked a hundred years ago, it is one's business insuch matters to have preferences, and when one has preferences oneceases to be fair. It is only an auctioneer who can equally andimpartially admire all schools of Art. No; fairness is not one ofthe qualities of the true critic. It is not even a condition ofcriticism. Each form of Art with which we come in contactdominates us for the moment to the exclusion of every other form.We must surrender ourselves absolutely to the work in question,whatever it may be, if we wish to gain its secret. For the time,we must think of nothing else, can think of nothing else, indeed.ERNEST. The true critic will be rational, at any rate, will henot?GILBERT. Rational? There are two ways of disliking art, Ernest.One is to dislike it. The other, to like it rationally. For Art,as Plato saw, and not without regret, creates in listener andspectator a form of divine madness. It does not spring frominspiration, but it makes others inspired. Reason is not thefaculty to which it appeals. If one loves Art at all, one mustlove it beyond all other things in the world, and against suchlove, the reason, if one listened to it, would cry out. There isnothing sane about the worship of beauty. It is too splendid to besane. Those of whose lives it forms the dominant note will alwaysseem to the world to be pure visionaries.ERNEST. Well, at least, the critic will be sincere.GILBERT. A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great dealof it is absolutely fatal. The true critic will, indeed, always besincere in his devotion to the principle of beauty, but he willseek for beauty in every age and in each school, and will neversuffer himself to be limited to any settled custom of thought orstereotyped mode of looking at things. He will realise himself inmany forms, and by a thousand different ways, and will ever becurious of new sensations and fresh points of view. Throughconstant change, and through constant change alone, he will findhis true unity. He will not consent to be the slave of his ownopinions. For what is mind but motion in the intellectual sphere?The essence of thought, as the essence of life, is growth. Youmust not be frightened by word, Ernest. What people callinsincerity is simply a method by which we can multiply ourpersonalities.ERNEST. I am afraid I have not been fortunate in my suggestions.GILBERT. Of the three qualifications you mentioned, two, sincerityand fairness, were, if not actually moral, at least on theborderland of morals, and the first condition of criticism is thatthe critic should be able to recognise that the sphere of Art andthe sphere of Ethics are absolutely distinct and separate. Whenthey are confused, Chaos has come again. They are too oftenconfused in England now, and though our modern Puritans cannotdestroy a beautiful thing, yet, by means of their extraordinaryprurience, they can almost taint beauty for a moment. It ischiefly, I regret to say, through journalism that such people findexpression. I regret it because there is much to be said in favourof modern journalism. By giving us the opinions of the uneducated,it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community. Bycarefully chronicling the current events of contemporary life, itshows us of what very little importance such events really are. Byinvariably discussing the unnecessary it makes us understand whatthings are requisite for culture, and what are not. But it shouldnot allow poor Tartuffe to write articles upon modern art. When itdoes this it stultifies itself. And yet Tartuffe's articles andChadband's notes do this good, at least. They serve to show howextremely limited is the area over which ethics, and ethicalconsiderations, can claim to exercise influence. Science is out ofthe reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths.Art is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed uponthings beautiful and immortal and ever-changing. To morals belongthe lower and less intellectual spheres. However, let thesemouthing Puritans pass; they have their comic side. Who can helplaughing when an ordinary journalist seriously proposes to limitthe subject-matter at the disposal of the artist? Some limitationmight well, and will soon, I hope, be placed upon some of ournewspapers and newspaper writers. For they give us the bald,sordid, disgusting facts of life. They chronicle, with degradingavidity, the sins of the second-rate, and with theconscientiousness of the illiterate give us accurate and prosaicdetails of the doings of people of absolutely no interestwhatsoever. But the artist, who accepts the facts of life, and yettransforms them into shapes of beauty, and makes them vehicles ofpity or of awe, and shows their colour-element, and their wonder,and their true ethical import also, and builds out of them a worldmore real than reality itself, and of loftier and more nobleimport--who shall set limits to him? Not the apostles of that newJournalism which is but the old vulgarity 'writ large.' Not theapostles of that new Puritanism, which is but the whine of thehypocrite, and is both writ and spoken badly. The mere suggestionis ridiculous. Let us leave these wicked people, and proceed tothe discussion of the artistic qualifications necessary for thetrue critic.ERNEST. And what are they? Tell me yourself.GILBERT. Temperament is the primary requisite for the critic--atemperament exquisitely susceptible to beauty, and to the variousimpressions that beauty gives us. Under what conditions, and bywhat means, this temperament is engendered in race or individual,we will not discuss at present. It is sufficient to note that itexists, and that there is in us a beauty-sense, separate from theother senses and above them, separate from the reason and of noblerimport, separate from the soul and of equal value--a sense thatleads some to create, and others, the finer spirits as I think, tocontemplate merely. But to be purified and made perfect, thissense requires some form of exquisite environment. Without this itstarves, or is dulled. You remember that lovely passage in whichPlato describes how a young Greek should be educated, and with whatinsistence he dwells upon the importance of surroundings, tellingus how the lad is to be brought up in the midst of fair sights andsounds, so that the beauty of material things may prepare his soulfor the reception of the beauty that is spiritual. Insensibly, andwithout knowing the reason why, he is to develop that real love ofbeauty which, as Plato is never weary of reminding us, is the trueaim of education. By slow degrees there is to be engendered in himsuch a temperament as will lead him naturally and simply to choosethe good in preference to the bad, and, rejecting what is vulgarand discordant, to follow by fine instinctive taste all thatpossesses grace and charm and loveliness. Ultimately, in its duecourse, this taste is to become critical and self-conscious, but atfirst it is to exist purely as a cultivated instinct, and 'he whohas received this true culture of the inner man will with clear andcertain vision perceive the omissions and faults in art or nature,and with a taste that cannot err, while he praises, and finds hispleasure in what is good, and receives it into his soul, and sobecomes good and noble, he will rightly blame and hate the bad, nowin the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reasonwhy': and so, when, later on, the critical and self-consciousspirit develops in him, he 'will recognise and salute it as afriend with whom his education has made him long familiar.' I needhardly say, Ernest, how far we in England have fallen short of thisideal, and I can imagine the smile that would illuminate the glossyface of the Philistine if one ventured to suggest to him that thetrue aim of education was the love of beauty, and that the methodsby which education should work were the development of temperament,the cultivation of taste, and the creation of the critical spirit.Yet, even for us, there is left some loveliness of environment, andthe dulness of tutors and professors matters very little when onecan loiter in the grey cloisters at Magdalen, and listen to someflute-like voice singing in Waynfleete's chapel, or lie in thegreen meadow, among the strange snake-spotted fritillaries, andwatch the sunburnt noon smite to a finer gold the tower's gildedvanes, or wander up the Christ Church staircase beneath the vaultedceiling's shadowy fans, or pass through the sculptured gateway ofLaud's building in the College of St. John. Nor is it merely atOxford, or Cambridge, that the sense of beauty can be formed andtrained and perfected. All over England there is a Renaissance ofthe decorative Arts. Ugliness has had its day. Even in the housesof the rich there is taste, and the houses of those who are notrich have been made gracious and comely and sweet to live in.Caliban, poor noisy Caliban, thinks that when he has ceased to makemows at a thing, the thing ceases to exist. But if he mocks nolonger, it is because he has been met with mockery, swifter andkeener than his own, and for a moment has been bitterly schooledinto that silence which should seal for ever his uncouth distortedlips. What has been done up to now, has been chiefly in theclearing of the way. It is always more difficult to destroy thanit is to create, and when what one has to destroy is vulgarity andstupidity, the task of destruction needs not merely courage butalso contempt. Yet it seems to me to have been, in a measure,done. We have got rid of what was bad. We have now to make whatis beautiful. And though the mission of the aesthetic movement isto lure people to contemplate, not to lead them to create, yet, asthe creative instinct is strong in the Celt, and it is the Celt wholeads in art, there is no reason why in future years this strangeRenaissance should not become almost as mighty in its way as wasthat new birth of Art that woke many centuries ago in the cities ofItaly.Certainly, for the cultivation of temperament, we must turn to thedecorative arts: to the arts that touch us, not to the arts thatteach us. Modern pictures are, no doubt, delightful to look at.At least, some of them are. But they are quite impossible to livewith; they are too clever, too assertive, too intellectual. Theirmeaning is too obvious, and their method too clearly defined. Oneexhausts what they have to say in a very short time, and then theybecome as tedious as one's relations. I am very fond of the workof many of the Impressionist painters of Paris and London.Subtlety and distinction have not yet left the school. Some oftheir arrangements and harmonies serve to remind one of theunapproachable beauty of Gautier's immortal Symphonie en BlancMajeur, that flawless masterpiece of colour and music which mayhave suggested the type as well as the titles of many of their bestpictures. For a class that welcomes the incompetent withsympathetic eagerness, and that confuses the bizarre with thebeautiful, and vulgarity with truth, they are extremelyaccomplished. They can do etchings that have the brilliancy ofepigrams, pastels that are as fascinating as paradoxes, and as fortheir portraits, whatever the commonplace may say against them, noone can deny that they possess that unique and wonderful charmwhich belongs to works of pure fiction. But even theImpressionists, earnest and industrious as they are, will not do.I like them. Their white keynote, with its variations in lilac,was an era in colour. Though the moment does not make the man, themoment certainly makes the Impressionist, and for the moment inart, and the 'moment's monument,' as Rossetti phrased it, what maynot be said? They are suggestive also. If they have not openedthe eyes of the blind, they have at least given great encouragementto the short-sighted, and while their leaders may have all theinexperience of old age, their young men are far too wise to beever sensible. Yet they will insist on treating painting as if itwere a mode of autobiography invented for the use of theilliterate, and are always prating to us on their coarse grittycanvases of their unnecessary selves and their unnecessaryopinions, and spoiling by a vulgar over-emphasis that fine contemptof nature which is the best and only modest thing about them. Onetires, at the end, of the work of individuals whose individualityis always noisy, and generally uninteresting. There is far more tobe said in favour of that newer school at Paris, the Archaicistes,as they call themselves, who, refusing to leave the artist entirelyat the mercy of the weather, do not find the ideal of art in mereatmospheric effect, but seek rather for the imaginative beauty ofdesign and the loveliness of fair colour, and rejecting the tediousrealism of those who merely paint what they see, try to seesomething worth seeing, and to see it not merely with actual andphysical vision, but with that nobler vision of the soul which isas far wider in spiritual scope as it is far more splendid inartistic purpose. They, at any rate, work under those decorativeconditions that each art requires for its perfection, and havesufficient aesthetic instinct to regret those sordid and stupidlimitations of absolute modernity of form which have proved theruin of so many of the Impressionists. Still, the art that isfrankly decorative is the art to live with. It is, of all ourvisible arts, the one art that creates in us both mood andtemperament. Mere colour, unspoiled by meaning, and unallied withdefinite form, can speak to the soul in a thousand different ways.The harmony that resides in the delicate proportions of lines andmasses becomes mirrored in the mind. The repetitions of patterngive us rest. The marvels of design stir the imagination. In themere loveliness of the materials employed there are latent elementsof culture. Nor is this all. By its deliberate rejection ofNature as the ideal of beauty, as well as of the imitative methodof the ordinary painter, decorative art not merely prepares thesoul for the reception of true imaginative work, but develops in itthat sense of form which is the basis of creative no less than ofcritical achievement. For the real artist is he who proceeds, notfrom feeling to form, but from form to thought and passion. Hedoes not first conceive an idea, and then say to himself, 'I willput my idea into a complex metre of fourteen lines,' but, realisingthe beauty of the sonnet-scheme, he conceives certain modes ofmusic and methods of rhyme, and the mere form suggests what is tofill it and make it intellectually and emotionally complete. Fromtime to time the world cries out against some charming artisticpoet, because, to use its hackneyed and silly phrase, he has'nothing to say.' But if he had something to say, he wouldprobably say it, and the result would be tedious. It is justbecause he has no new message, that he can do beautiful work. Hegains his inspiration from form, and from form purely, as an artistshould. A real passion would ruin him. Whatever actually occursis spoiled for art. All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling.To be natural is to be obvious, and to be obvious is to beinartistic.ERNEST. I wonder do you really believe what you say?GILBERT. Why should you wonder? It is not merely in art that thebody is the soul. In every sphere of life Form is the beginning ofthings. The rhythmic harmonious gestures of dancing convey, Platotells us, both rhythm and harmony into the mind. Forms are thefood of faith, cried Newman in one of those great moments ofsincerity that make us admire and know the man. He was right,though he may not have known how terribly right he was. The Creedsare believed, not because they are rational, but because they arerepeated. Yes: Form is everything. It is the secret of life.Find expression for a sorrow, and it will become dear to you. Findexpression for a joy, and you intensify its ecstasy. Do you wishto love? Use Love's Litany, and the words will create the yearningfrom which the world fancies that they spring. Have you a griefthat corrodes your heart? Steep yourself in the Language of grief,learn its utterance from Prince Hamlet and Queen Constance, and youwill find that mere expression is a mode of consolation, and thatForm, which is the birth of passion, is also the death of pain.And so, to return to the sphere of Art, it is Form that creates notmerely the critical temperament, but also the aesthetic instinct,that unerring instinct that reveals to one all things under theirconditions of beauty. Start with the worship of form, and there isno secret in art that will not be revealed to you, and rememberthat in criticism, as in creation, temperament is everything, andthat it is, not by the time of their production, but by thetemperaments to which they appeal, that the schools of art shouldbe historically grouped.ERNEST. Your theory of education is delightful. But whatinfluence will your critic, brought up in these exquisitesurroundings, possess? Do you really think that any artist is everaffected by criticism?GILBERT. The influence of the critic will be the mere fact of hisown existence. He will represent the flawless type. In him theculture of the century will see itself realised. You must not askof him to have any aim other than the perfecting of himself. Thedemand of the intellect, as has been well said, is simply to feelitself alive. The critic may, indeed, desire to exerciseinfluence; but, if so, he will concern himself not with theindividual, but with the age, which he will seek to wake intoconsciousness, and to make responsive, creating in it new desiresand appetites, and lending it his larger vision and his noblermoods. The actual art of to-day will occupy him less than the artof to-morrow, far less than the art of yesterday, and as for thisor that person at present toiling away, what do the industriousmatter? They do their best, no doubt, and consequently we get theworst from them. It is always with the best intentions that theworst work is done. And besides, my dear Ernest, when a manreaches the age of forty, or becomes a Royal Academician, or iselected a member of the Athenaeum Club, or is recognised as apopular novelist, whose books are in great demand at suburbanrailway stations, one may have the amusement of exposing him, butone cannot have the pleasure of reforming him. And this is, I daresay, very fortunate for him; for I have no doubt that reformationis a much more painful process than punishment, is indeedpunishment in its most aggravated and moral form--a fact whichaccounts for our entire failure as a community to reclaim thatinteresting phenomenon who is called the confirmed criminal.ERNEST. But may it not be that the poet is the best judge ofpoetry, and the painter of painting? Each art must appealprimarily to the artist who works in it. His judgment will surelybe the most valuable?GILBERT. The appeal of all art is simply to the artistictemperament. Art does not address herself to the specialist. Herclaim is that she is universal, and that in all her manifestationsshe is one. Indeed, so far from its being true that the artist isthe best judge of art, a really great artist can never judge ofother people's work at all, and can hardly, in fact, judge of hisown. That very concentration of vision that makes a man an artist,limits by its sheer intensity his faculty of fine appreciation.The energy of creation hurries him blindly on to his own goal. Thewheels of his chariot raise the dust as a cloud around him. Thegods are hidden from each other. They can recognise theirworshippers. That is all.ERNEST. You say that a great artist cannot recognise the beauty ofwork different from his own.GILBERT. It is impossible for him to do so. Wordsworth saw inEndymion merely a pretty piece of Paganism, and Shelley, with hisdislike of actuality, was deaf to Wordsworth's message, beingrepelled by its form, and Byron, that great passionate humanincomplete creature, could appreciate neither the poet of the cloudnor the poet of the lake, and the wonder of Keats was hidden fromhim. The realism of Euripides was hateful to Sophokles. Thosedroppings of warm tears had no music for him. Milton, with hissense of the grand style, could not understand the method ofShakespeare, any more than could Sir Joshua the method ofGainsborough. Bad artists always admire each other's work. Theycall it being large-minded and free from prejudice. But a trulygreat artist cannot conceive of life being shown, or beautyfashioned, under any conditions other than those that he hasselected. Creation employs all its critical faculty within its ownsphere. It may not use it in the sphere that belongs to others.It is exactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the properjudge of it.ERNEST. Do you really mean that?GILBERT. Yes, for creation limits, while contemplation widens, thevision.ERNEST. But what about technique? Surely each art has itsseparate technique?GILBERT. Certainly: each art has its grammar and its materials.There is no mystery about either, and the incompetent can always becorrect. But, while the laws upon which Art rests may be fixed andcertain, to find their true realisation they must be touched by theimagination into such beauty that they will seem an exception, eachone of them. Technique is really personality. That is the reasonwhy the artist cannot teach it, why the pupil cannot learn it, andwhy the aesthetic critic can understand it. To the great poet,there is only one method of music--his own. To the great painter,there is only one manner of painting--that which he himselfemploys. The aesthetic critic, and the aesthetic critic alone, canappreciate all forms and modes. It is to him that Art makes herappeal.ERNEST. Well, I think I have put all my questions to you. And nowI must admit -GILBERT. Ah! don't say that you agree with me. When people agreewith me I always feel that I must be wrong.ERNEST. In that case I certainly won't tell you whether I agreewith you or not. But I will put another question. You haveexplained to me that criticism is a creative art. What future hasit?GILBERT. It is to criticism that the future belongs. The subject-matter at the disposal of creation becomes every day more limitedin extent and variety. Providence and Mr. Walter Besant haveexhausted the obvious. If creation is to last at all, it can onlydo so on the condition of becoming far more critical than it is atpresent. The old roads and dusty highways have been traversed toooften. Their charm has been worn away by plodding feet, and theyhave lost that element of novelty or surprise which is so essentialfor romance. He who would stir us now by fiction must either giveus an entirely new background, or reveal to us the soul of man inits innermost workings. The first is for the moment being done forus by Mr. Rudyard Kipling. As one turns over the pages of hisPlain Tales from the Hills, one feels as if one were seated under apalm-tree reading life by superb flashes of vulgarity. The brightcolours of the bazaars dazzle one's eyes. The jaded, second-rateAnglo-Indians are in exquisite incongruity with their surroundings.The mere lack of style in the story-teller gives an oddjournalistic realism to what he tells us. From the point of viewof literature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates.From the point of view of life, he is a reporter who knowsvulgarity better than any one has ever known it. Dickens knew itsclothes and its comedy. Mr. Kipling knows its essence and itsseriousness. He is our first authority on the second-rate, and hasseen marvellous things through keyholes, and his backgrounds arereal works of art. As for the second condition, we have hadBrowning, and Meredith is with us. But there is still much to bedone in the sphere of introspection. People sometimes say thatfiction is getting too morbid. As far as psychology is concerned,it has never been morbid enough. We have merely touched thesurface of the soul, that is all. In one single ivory cell of thebrain there are stored away things more marvellous and moreterrible than even they have dreamed of, who, like the author of LeRouge et le Noir, have sought to track the soul into its mostsecret places, and to make life confess its dearest sins. Still,there is a limit even to the number of untried backgrounds, and itis possible that a further development of the habit ofintrospection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which itseeks to supply fresh material. I myself am inclined to think thatcreation is doomed. It springs from too primitive, too natural animpulse. However this may be, it is certain that the subject-matter at the disposal of creation is always diminishing, while thesubject-matter of criticism increases daily. There are always newattitudes for the mind, and new points of view. The duty ofimposing form upon chaos does not grow less as the world advances.There was never a time when Criticism was more needed than it isnow. It is only by its means that Humanity can become conscious ofthe point at which it has arrived.Hours ago, Ernest, you asked me the use of Criticism. You mightjust as well have asked me the use of thought. It is Criticism, asArnold points out, that creates the intellectual atmosphere of theage. It is Criticism, as I hope to point out myself some day, thatmakes the mind a fine instrument. We, in our educational system,have burdened the memory with a load of unconnected facts, andlaboriously striven to impart our laboriously-acquired knowledge.We teach people how to remember, we never teach them how to grow.It has never occurred to us to try and develop in the mind a moresubtle quality of apprehension and discernment. The Greeks didthis, and when we come in contact with the Greek criticalintellect, we cannot but be conscious that, while our subject-matter is in every respect larger and more varied than theirs,theirs is the only method by which this subject-matter can beinterpreted. England has done one thing; it has invented andestablished Public Opinion, which is an attempt to organise theignorance of the community, and to elevate it to the dignity ofphysical force. But Wisdom has always been hidden from it.Considered as an instrument of thought, the English mind is coarseand undeveloped. The only thing that can purify it is the growthof the critical instinct.It is Criticism, again, that, by concentration, makes culturepossible. It takes the cumbersome mass of creative work, anddistils it into a finer essence. Who that desires to retain anysense of form could struggle through the monstrous multitudinousbooks that the world has produced, books in which thought stammersor ignorance brawls? The thread that is to guide us across thewearisome labyrinth is in the hands of Criticism. Nay more, wherethere is no record, and history is either lost, or was neverwritten, Criticism can re-create the past for us from the verysmallest fragment of language or art, just as surely as the man ofscience can from some tiny bone, or the mere impress of a foot upona rock, re-create for us the winged dragon or Titan lizard thatonce made the earth shake beneath its tread, can call Behemoth outof his cave, and make Leviathan swim once more across the startledsea. Prehistoric history belongs to the philological andarchaeological critic. It is to him that the origins of things arerevealed. The self-conscious deposits of an age are nearly alwaysmisleading. Through philological criticism alone we know more ofthe centuries of which no actual record has been preserved, than wedo of the centuries that have left us their scrolls. It can do forus what can be done neither by physics nor metaphysics. It cangive us the exact science of mind in the process of becoming. Itcan do for us what History cannot do. It can tell us what manthought before he learned how to write. You have asked me aboutthe influence of Criticism. I think I have answered that questionalready; but there is this also to be said. It is Criticism thatmakes us cosmopolitan. The Manchester school tried to make menrealise the brotherhood of humanity, by pointing out the commercialadvantages of peace. It sought to degrade the wonderful world intoa common market-place for the buyer and the seller. It addresseditself to the lowest instincts, and it failed. War followed uponwar, and the tradesman's creed did not prevent France and Germanyfrom clashing together in blood-stained battle. There are othersof our own day who seek to appeal to mere emotional sympathies, orto the shallow dogmas of some vague system of abstract ethics.They have their Peace Societies, so dear to the sentimentalists,and their proposals for unarmed International Arbitration, sopopular among those who have never read history. But mereemotional sympathy will not do. It is too variable, and tooclosely connected with the passions; and a board of arbitratorswho, for the general welfare of the race, are to be deprived of thepower of putting their decisions into execution, will not be ofmuch avail. There is only one thing worse than Injustice, and thatis Justice without her sword in her hand. When Right is not Might,it is Evil.No: the emotions will not make us cosmopolitan, any more than thegreed for gain could do so. It is only by the cultivation of thehabit of intellectual criticism that we shall be able to risesuperior to race-prejudices. Goethe--you will not misunderstandwhat I say--was a German of the Germans. He loved his country--noman more so. Its people were dear to him; and he led them. Yet,when the iron hoof of Napoleon trampled upon vineyard andcornfield, his lips were silent. 'How can one write songs ofhatred without hating?' he said to Eckermann, 'and how could I, towhom culture and barbarism are alone of importance, hate a nationwhich is among the most cultivated of the earth and to which I oweso great a part of my own cultivation?' This note, sounded in themodern world by Goethe first, will become, I think, the startingpoint for the cosmopolitanism of the future. Criticism willannihilate race-prejudices, by insisting upon the unity of thehuman mind in the variety of its forms. If we are tempted to makewar upon another nation, we shall remember that we are seeking todestroy an element of our own culture, and possibly its mostimportant element. As long as war is regarded as wicked, it willalways have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, itwill cease to be popular. The change will of course be slow, andpeople will not be conscious of it. They will not say 'We will notwar against France because her prose is perfect,' but because theprose of France is perfect, they will not hate the land.Intellectual criticism will bind Europe together in bonds farcloser than those that can be forged by shopman or sentimentalist.It will give us the peace that springs from understanding.Nor is this all. It is Criticism that, recognising no position asfinal, and refusing to bind itself by the shallow shibboleths ofany sect or school, creates that serene philosophic temper whichloves truth for its own sake, and loves it not the less because itknows it to be unattainable. How little we have of this temper inEngland, and how much we need it! The English mind is always in arage. The intellect of the race is wasted in the sordid and stupidquarrels of second-rate politicians or third-rate theologians. Itwas reserved for a man of science to show us the supreme example ofthat 'sweet reasonableness' of which Arnold spoke so wisely, and,alas! to so little effect. The author of the Origin of Specieshad, at any rate, the philosophic temper. If one contemplates theordinary pulpits and platforms of England, one can but feel thecontempt of Julian, or the indifference of Montaigne. We aredominated by the fanatic, whose worst vice is his sincerity.Anything approaching to the free play of the mind is practicallyunknown amongst us. People cry out against the sinner, yet it isnot the sinful, but the stupid, who are our shame. There is no sinexcept stupidity.ERNEST. Ah! what an antinomian you are!GILBERT. The artistic critic, like the mystic, is an antinomianalways. To be good, according to the vulgar standard of goodness,is obviously quite easy. It merely requires a certain amount ofsordid terror, a certain lack of imaginative thought, and a certainlow passion for middle-class respectability. Aesthetics are higherthan ethics. They belong to a more spiritual sphere. To discernthe beauty of a thing is the finest point to which we can arrive.Even a colour-sense is more important, in the development of theindividual, than a sense of right and wrong. Aesthetics, in fact,are to Ethics in the sphere of conscious civilisation, what, in thesphere of the external world, sexual is to natural selection.Ethics, like natural selection, make existence possible.Aesthetics, like sexual selection, make life lovely and wonderful,fill it with new forms, and give it progress, and variety andchange. And when we reach the true culture that is our aim, weattain to that perfection of which the saints have dreamed, theperfection of those to whom sin is impossible, not because theymake the renunciations of the ascetic, but because they can doeverything they wish without hurt to the soul, and can wish fornothing that can do the soul harm, the soul being an entity sodivine that it is able to transform into elements of a richerexperience, or a finer susceptibility, or a newer mode of thought,acts or passions that with the common would be commonplace, or withthe uneducated ignoble, or with the shameful vile. Is thisdangerous? Yes; it is dangerous--all ideas, as I told you, are so.But the night wearies, and the light flickers in the lamp. Onemore thing I cannot help saying to you. You have spoken againstCriticism as being a sterile thing. The nineteenth century is aturning point in history, simply on account of the work of two men,Darwin and Renan, the one the critic of the Book of Nature, theother the critic of the books of God. Not to recognise this is tomiss the meaning of one of the most important eras in the progressof the world. Creation is always behind the age. It is Criticismthat leads us. The Critical Spirit and the World-Spirit are one.ERNEST. And he who is in possession of this spirit, or whom thisspirit possesses, will, I suppose, do nothing?GILBERT. Like the Persephone of whom Landor tells us, the sweetpensive Persephone around whose white feet the asphodel andamaranth are blooming, he will sit contented 'in that deep,motionless quiet which mortals pity, and which the gods enjoy.' Hewill look out upon the world and know its secret. By contact withdivine things he will become divine. His will be the perfect life,and his only.ERNEST. You have told me many strange things to-night, Gilbert.You have told me that it is more difficult to talk about a thingthan to do it, and that to do nothing at all is the most difficultthing in the world; you have told me that all Art is immoral, andall thought dangerous; that criticism is more creative thancreation, and that the highest criticism is that which reveals inthe work of Art what the artist had not put there; that it isexactly because a man cannot do a thing that he is the proper judgeof it; and that the true critic is unfair, insincere, and notrational. My friend, you are a dreamer.GILBERT. Yes: I am a dreamer. For a dreamer is one who can onlyfind his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees thedawn before the rest of the world.ERNEST. His punishment?GILBERT. And his reward. But, see, it is dawn already. Draw backthe curtains and open the windows wide. How cool the morning airis! Piccadilly lies at our feet like a long riband of silver. Afaint purple mist hangs over the Park, and the shadows of the whitehouses are purple. It is too late to sleep. Let us go down toCovent Garden and look at the roses. Come! I am tired of thought.
