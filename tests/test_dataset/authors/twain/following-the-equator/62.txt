There are no people who are quite so vulgar as the over-refined ones. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

We sailed from Calcutta toward the end of March; stopped a day at Madras;two or three days in Ceylon; then sailed westward on a long flight forMauritius.  From my diary:
April 7.  We are far abroad upon the smooth waters of the Indian Ocean,now; it is shady and pleasant and peaceful under the vast spread of theawnings, and life is perfect again--ideal.
The difference between a river and the sea is, that the river looksfluid, the sea solid--usually looks as if you could step out and walk onit.
The captain has this peculiarity--he cannot tell the truth in a plausibleway.  In this he is the very opposite of the austere Scot who sits midwayof the table; he cannot tell a lie in an unplausible way.  When thecaptain finishes a statement the passengers glance at each otherprivately, as who should say, "Do you believe that?"  When the Scotfinishes one, the look says, "How strange and interesting."  The wholesecret is in the manner and method of the two men.  The captain is alittle shy and diffident, and he states the simplest fact as if he were alittle afraid of it, while the Scot delivers himself of the mostabandoned lie with such an air of stern veracity that one is forced tobelieve it although one knows it isn't so.  For instance, the Scot toldabout a pet flying-fish he once owned, that lived in a little fountain inhis conservatory, and supported itself by catching birds and frogs andrats in the neighboring fields.  It was plain that no one at the tabledoubted this statement.
By and by, in the course of some talk about custom-house annoyances, thecaptain brought out the following simple everyday incident, but throughhis infirmity of style managed to tell it in such a way that it got nocredence.  He said:
     "I went ashore at Naples one voyage when I was in that trade, and     stood around helping my passengers, for I could speak a little     Italian.  Two or three times, at intervals, the officer asked me if     I had anything dutiable about me, and seemed more and more put out     and disappointed every time I told him no.  Finally a passenger whom     I had helped through asked me to come out and take something.  I     thanked him, but excused myself, saying I had taken a whisky just     before I came ashore.
     "It was a fatal admission.  The officer at once made me pay sixpence     import-duty on the whisky-just from ship to shore, you see; and he     fined me L5 for not declaring the goods, another L5 for falsely     denying that I had anything dutiable about me, also L5 for     concealing the goods, and L50 for smuggling, which is the maximum     penalty for unlawfully bringing in goods under the value of     sevenpence ha'penny.  Altogether, sixty-five pounds sixpence for a     little thing like that."
The Scot is always believed, yet he never tells anything but lies;whereas the captain is never believed, although he never tells a lie, sofar as I can judge.  If he should say his uncle was a male person, hewould probably say it in such a way that nobody would believe it; at thesame time the Scot could claim that he had a female uncle and not stir adoubt in anybody's mind.  My own luck has been curious all my literarylife; I never could tell a lie that anybody would doubt, nor a truth thatanybody would believe.
Lots of pets on board--birds and things.  In these far countries thewhite people do seem to run remarkably to pets.  Our host in Cawnpore hada fine collection of birds--the finest we saw in a private house inIndia.  And in Colombo, Dr. Murray's great compound and commodiousbungalow were well populated with domesticated company from the woods:frisky little squirrels; a Ceylon mina walking sociably about the house;a small green parrot that whistled a single urgent note of call withoutmotion of its beak; also chuckled; a monkey in a cage on the backveranda, and some more out in the trees; also a number of beautifulmacaws in the trees; and various and sundry birds and animals of breedsnot known to me.  But no cat.  Yet a cat would have liked that place.
April 9.  Tea-planting is the great business in Ceylon, now.  A passengersays it often pays 40 per cent. on the investment.  Says there is a boom.
April 10.  The sea is a Mediterranean blue; and I believe that that isabout the divinest color known to nature.
It is strange and fine--Nature's lavish generosities to her creatures.At least to all of them except man.  For those that fly she has provideda home that is nobly spacious--a home which is forty miles deep andenvelops the whole globe, and has not an obstruction in it.  For thosethat swim she has provided a more than imperial domain--a domain which ismiles deep and covers four-fifths of the globe.  But as for man, she hascut him off with the mere odds and ends of the creation.  She has givenhim the thin skin, the meagre skin which is stretched over the remainingone-fifth--the naked bones stick up through it in most places.  On theone-half of this domain he can raise snow, ice, sand, rocks, and nothingelse.  So the valuable part of his inheritance really consists of but asingle fifth of the family estate; and out of it he has to grub hard toget enough to keep him alive and provide kings and soldiers and powder toextend the blessings of civilization with.  Yet man, in his simplicityand complacency and inability to cipher, thinks Nature regards him as theimportant member of the family--in fact, her favorite.  Surely, it mustoccur to even his dull head, sometimes, that she has a curious way ofshowing it.
Afternoon.  The captain has been telling how, in one of his Arcticvoyages, it was so cold that the mate's shadow froze fast to the deck andhad to be ripped loose by main strength.  And even then he got only abouttwo-thirds of it back.  Nobody said anything, and the captain went away.I think he is becoming disheartened .  .  .  .  Also, to be fair, thereis another word of praise due to this ship's library: it contains no copyof the Vicar of Wakefield, that strange menagerie of complacenthypocrites and idiots, of theatrical cheap-john heroes and heroines, whoare always showing off, of bad people who are not interesting, and goodpeople who are fatiguing.  A singular book.  Not a sincere line in it,and not a character that invites respect; a book which is one longwaste-pipe discharge of goody-goody puerilities and dreary moralities; abook which is full of pathos which revolts, and humor which grieves theheart. There are few things in literature that are more piteous, morepathetic, than the celebrated "humorous" incident of Moses and thespectacles. Jane Austen's books, too, are absent from this library.  Justthat one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a librarythat hadn't a book in it.
Customs in tropic seas.  At 5 in the morning they pipe to wash down thedecks, and at once the ladies who are sleeping there turn out and theyand their beds go below.  Then one after another the men come up from thebath in their pyjamas, and walk the decks an hour or two with bare legsand bare feet.  Coffee and fruit served.  The ship cat and her kitten nowappear and get about their toilets; next the barber comes and flays us onthe breezy deck.  Breakfast at 9.30, and the day begins.  I do not knowhow a day could be more reposeful: no motion; a level blue sea; nothingin sight from horizon to horizon; the speed of the ship furnishes acooling breeze; there is no mail to read and answer; no newspapers toexcite you; no telegrams to fret you or fright you--the world is far, faraway; it has ceased to exist for you--seemed a fading dream, along in thefirst days; has dissolved to an unreality now; it is gone from your mindwith all its businesses and ambitions, its prosperities and disasters,its exultations and despairs, its joys and griefs and cares and worries.They are no concern of yours any more; they have gone out of your life;they are a storm which has passed and left a deep calm behind.  Thepeople group themselves about the decks in their snowy white linen, andread, smoke, sew, play cards, talk, nap, and so on.  In other ships thepassengers are always ciphering about when they are going to arrive; outin these seas it is rare, very rare, to hear that subject broached.  Inother ships there is always an eager rush to the bulletin board at noonto find out what the "run" has been; in these seas the bulletin seems toattract no interest; I have seen no one visit it; in thirteen days I havevisited it only once.  Then I happened to notice the figures of the day'srun.  On that day there happened to be talk, at dinner, about the speedof modern ships.  I was the only passenger present who knew this ship'sgait.  Necessarily, the Atlantic custom of betting on the ship's run isnot a custom here--nobody ever mentions it.
I myself am wholly indifferent as to when we are going to "get in"; ifany one else feels interested in the matter he has not indicated it in myhearing.  If I had my way we should never get in at all.  This sort ofsea life is charged with an indestructible charm.  There is no weariness,no fatigue, no worry, no responsibility, no work, no depression ofspirits.  There is nothing like this serenity, this comfort, this peace,this deep contentment, to be found anywhere on land.  If I had my way Iwould sail on for ever and never go to live on the solid ground again.
One of Kipling's ballads has delivered the aspect and sentiment of thisbewitching sea correctly:
               "The Injian Ocean sets an' smiles               So sof', so bright, so bloomin' blue;               There aren't a wave for miles an' miles               Excep' the jiggle from the screw."
April 14.  It turns out that the astronomical apprentice worked off asection of the Milky Way on me for the Magellan Clouds.  A man of moreexperience in the business showed one of them to me last night.  It wassmall and faint and delicate, and looked like the ghost of a bunch ofwhite smoke left floating in the sky by an exploded bombshell.
Wednesday, April 15.  Mauritius.  Arrived and anchored off Port Louis2 A. M.  Rugged clusters of crags and peaks, green to their summits; fromtheir bases to the sea a green plain with just tilt enough to it to makethe water drain off.  I believe it is in 56 E.  and 22 S.--a hot tropicalcountry.  The green plain has an inviting look; has scattering dwellingsnestling among the greenery.  Scene of the sentimental adventure of Pauland Virginia.
Island under French control--which means a community which depends uponquarantines, not sanitation, for its health.
Thursday, April 16.  Went ashore in the forenoon at Port Louis, a littletown, but with the largest variety of nationalities and complexions wehave encountered yet.  French, English, Chinese, Arabs, Africans withwool, blacks with straight hair, East Indians, half-whites, quadroons--and great varieties in costumes and colors.
Took the train for Curepipe at 1.30--two hours' run, gradually uphill.What a contrast, this frantic luxuriance of vegetation, with the aridplains of India; these architecturally picturesque crags and knobs andminiature mountains, with the monotony of the Indian dead-levels.
A native pointed out a handsome swarthy man of grave and dignifiedbearing, and said in an awed tone, "That is so-and-so; has held office ofone sort or another under this government for 37 years--he is known allover this whole island and in the other countries of the world perhaps--who knows?  One thing is certain; you can speak his name anywhere in thiswhole island, and you will find not one grown person that has not heardit.  It is a wonderful thing to be so celebrated; yet look at him; itmakes no change in him; he does not even seem to know it."
Curepipe (means Pincushion or Pegtown, probably).  Sixteen miles (twohours) by rail from Port Louis.  At each end of every roof and on theapex of every dormer window a wooden peg two feet high stands up; in somecases its top is blunt, in others the peg is sharp and looks like atoothpick.  The passion for this humble ornament is universal.
Apparently, there has been only one prominent event in the history ofMauritius, and that one didn't happen.  I refer to the romantic sojournof Paul and Virginia here.  It was that story that made Mauritius knownto the world, made the name familiar to everybody, the geographicalposition of it to nobody.
A clergyman was asked to guess what was in a box on a table.  It was avellum fan painted with the shipwreck, and was "one of Virginia's weddinggifts."
April 18.  This is the only country in the world where the stranger isnot asked "How do you like this place?"  This is indeed a largedistinction.  Here the citizen does the talking about the countryhimself; the stranger is not asked to help.  You get all sorts ofinformation.  From one citizen you gather the idea that Mauritius wasmade first, and then heaven; and that heaven was copied after Mauritius.Another one tells you that this is an exaggeration; that the two chiefvillages, Port Louis and Curepipe, fall short of heavenly perfection;that nobody lives in Port Louis except upon compulsion, and that Curepipeis the wettest and rainiest place in the world.  An English citizen said:
     "In the early part of this century Mauritius was used by the French     as a basis from which to operate against England's Indian     merchantmen; so England captured the island and also the neighbor,     Bourbon, to stop that annoyance.  England gave Bourbon back; the     government in London did not want any more possessions in the West     Indies.  If the government had had a better quality of geography in     stock it would not have wasted Bourbon in that foolish way.  A big     war will temporarily shut up the Suez Canal some day and the English     ships will have to go to India around the Cape of Good Hope again;     then England will have to have Bourbon and will take it.
     "Mauritius was a crown colony until 20 years ago, with a governor     appointed by the Crown and assisted by a Council appointed by     himself; but Pope Hennessey came out as Governor then, and he worked     hard to get a part of the council made elective, and succeeded.  So     now the whole council is French, and in all ordinary matters of     legislation they vote together and in the French interest, not the     English. The English population is very slender; it has not votes     enough to elect a legislator.  Half a dozen rich French families     elect the legislature.  Pope Hennessey was an Irishman, a Catholic,     a Home Ruler, M.P., a hater of England and the English, a very     troublesome person and a serious incumbrance at Westminster; so it     was decided to send him out to govern unhealthy countries, in hope     that something would happen to him.  But nothing did.  The first     experiment was not merely a failure, it was more than a failure.  He     proved to be more of a disease himself than any he was sent to     encounter.  The next experiment was here.  The dark scheme failed     again.  It was an off-season and there was nothing but measles here     at the time.  Pope Hennessey's health was not affected.  He worked     with the French and for the French and against the English, and he     made the English very tired and the French very happy, and lived to     have the joy of seeing the flag he served publicly hissed.  His     memory is held in worshipful reverence and affection by the French.
     "It is a land of extraordinary quarantines.  They quarantine a ship     for anything or for nothing; quarantine her for 20 and even 30 days.     They once quarantined a ship because her captain had had the     smallpox when he was a boy.  That and because he was English.
     "The population is very small; small to insignificance.  The     majority is East Indian; then mongrels; then negroes (descendants of     the slaves of the French times); then French; then English.  There     was an American, but he is dead or mislaid.  The mongrels are the     result of all kinds of mixtures; black and white, mulatto and white,     quadroon and white, octoroon and white.  And so there is every shade     of complexion; ebony, old mahogany, horsechestnut, sorrel,     molasses-candy, clouded amber, clear amber, old-ivory white,     new-ivory white, fish-belly white--this latter the leprous complexion     frequent with the Anglo-Saxon long resident in tropical climates.
     "You wouldn't expect a person to be proud of being a Mauritian, now     would you?  But it is so.  The most of them have never been out of     the island, and haven't read much or studied much, and they think     the world consists of three principal countries--Judaea, France, and     Mauritius; so they are very proud of belonging to one of the three     grand divisions of the globe.  They think that Russia and Germany     are in England, and that England does not amount to much.  They have     heard vaguely about the United States and the equator, but they     think both of them are monarchies.  They think Mount Peter Botte is     the highest mountain in the world, and if you show one of them a     picture of Milan Cathedral he will swell up with satisfaction and     say that the idea of that jungle of spires was stolen from the     forest of peg-tops and toothpicks that makes the roofs of Curepipe     look so fine and prickly.
     "There is not much trade in books.  The newspapers educate and     entertain the people.  Mainly the latter.  They have two pages of     large-print reading-matter-one of them English, the other French.     The English page is a translation of the French one.  The typography     is super-extra primitive--in this quality it has not its equal     anywhere.  There is no proof-reader now; he is dead.
     "Where do they get matter to fill up a page in this little island     lost in the wastes of the Indian Ocean?  Oh, Madagascar.  They     discuss Madagascar and France.  That is the bulk.  Then they chock     up the rest with advice to the Government.  Also, slurs upon the     English administration.  The papers are all owned and edited by     creoles--French.
     "The language of the country is French.  Everybody speaks it--has     to.  You have to know French particularly mongrel French, the patois     spoken by Tom, Dick, and Harry of the multiform complexions--or you     can't get along.
"This was a flourishing country in former days, for it made then andstill makes the best sugar in the world; but first the Suez Canal severedit from the world and left it out in the cold and next the beetroot sugarhelped by bounties, captured the European markets.  Sugar is the life ofMauritius, and it is losing its grip. Its downward course was checked bythe depreciation of the rupee--for the planter pays wages in rupees butsells his crop for gold--and the insurrection in Cuba and paralyzation ofthe sugar industry there have given our prices here a life-saving lift;but the outlook has nothing permanently favorable about it.  It takes ayear to mature the canes--on the high ground three and six months longer--and there is always a chance that the annual cyclone will rip theprofit out of the crop.  In recent times a cyclone took the whole crop,as you may say; and the island never saw a finer one.  Some of thenoblest sugar estates in the island are in deep difficulties.  A dozen ofthem are investments of English capital; and the companies that own themare at work now, trying to settle up and get out with a saving of halfthe money they put in.  You know, in these days, when a country begins tointroduce the tea culture, it means that its own specialty has gone backon it.  Look at Bengal; look at Ceylon.  Well, they've begun to introducethe tea culture, here.
"Many copies of Paul and Virginia are sold every year in Mauritius.  Noother book is so popular here except the Bible.  By many it is supposedto be a part of the Bible.  All the missionaries work up their French onit when they come here to pervert the Catholic mongrel.  It is thegreatest story that was ever written about Mauritius, and the only one."
