Joan Gives the Fatal Answer
FRIDAY and Saturday were happy days for Noel and me. Our minds were fullof our splendid dream of France aroused--France shaking her mane--Franceon the march--France at the gates--Rouen in ashes, and Joan free! Ourimagination was on fire; we were delirious with pride and joy. For wewere very young, as I have said.
We knew nothing about what had been happening in the dungeon in theyester-afternoon. We supposed that as Joan had abjured and been takenback into the forgiving bosom of the Church, she was being gently usednow, and her captivity made as pleasant and comfortable for her as thecircumstances would allow. So, in high contentment, we planned out ourshare in the great rescue, and fought our part of the fight over and overagain during those two happy days--as happy days as ever I have known.
Sunday morning came. I was awake, enjoying the balmy, lazy weather, andthinking. Thinking of the rescue--what else? I had no other thought now.I was absorbed in that, drunk with the happiness of it.
I heard a voice shouting far down the street, and soon it came nearer,and I caught the words:
"Joan of Arc has relapsed! The witch's time has come!"
It stopped my heart, it turned my blood to ice. That was more than sixtyyears ago, but that triumphant note rings as clear in my memory to-day asit rang in my ear that long-vanished summer morning. We are so strangelymade; the memories that could make us happy pass away; it is the memoriesthat break our hearts that abide.
Soon other voices took up that cry--tens, scores, hundreds of voices; allthe world seemed filled with the brutal joy of it. And there were otherclamors--the clatter of rushing feet, merry congratulations, bursts ofcoarse laughter, the rolling of drums, the boom and crash of distantbands profaning the sacred day with the music of victory andthanksgiving.
About the middle of the afternoon came a summons for Manchon and me to goto Joan's dungeon--a summons from Cauchon. But by that time distrust hadalready taken possession of the English and their soldiery again, and allRouen was in an angry and threatening mood. We could see plenty ofevidences of this from our own windows--fist-shaking, black looks,tumultuous tides of furious men billowing by along the street.
And we learned that up at the castle things were going very badly,indeed; that there was a great mob gathered there who considered therelapse a lie and a priestly trick, and among them many half-drunkEnglish soldiers. Moreover, these people had gone beyond words. They hadlaid hands upon a number of churchmen who were trying to enter thecastle, and it had been difficult work to rescue them and save theirlives.
And so Manchon refused to go. He said he would not go a step without asafeguard from Warwick. So next morning Warwick sent an escort ofsoldiers, and then we went. Matters had not grown peacefuler meantime,but worse. The soldiers protected us from bodily damage, but as we passedthrough the great mob at the castle we were assailed with insults andshameful epithets. I bore it well enough, though, and said to myself,with secret satisfaction, "In three or four short days, my lads, you willbe employing your tongues in a different sort from this--and I shall bethere to hear."
To my mind these were as good as dead men. How many of them would stillbe alive after the rescue that was coming? Not more than enough to amusethe executioner a short half-hour, certainly.
It turned out that the report was true. Joan had relapsed. She wassitting there in her chains, clothed again in her male attire.
She accused nobody. That was her way. It was not in her character to holda servant to account for what his master had made him do, and her mindhad cleared now, and she knew that the advantage which had been taken ofher the previous morning had its origin, not in the subordinate but inthe master--Cauchon.
Here is what had happened. While Joan slept, in the early morning ofSunday, one of the guards stole her female apparel and put her maleattire in its place. When she woke she asked for the other dress, but theguards refused to give it back. She protested, and said she was forbiddento wear the male dress. But they continued to refuse. She had to haveclothing, for modesty's sake; moreover, she saw that she could not saveher life if she must fight for it against treacheries like this; so sheput on the forbidden garments, knowing what the end would be. She wasweary of the struggle, poor thing.
We had followed in the wake of Cauchon, the Vice-Inquisitor, and theothers--six or eight--and when I saw Joan sitting there, despondent,forlorn, and still in chains, when I was expecting to find her situationso different, I did not know what to make of it. The shock was verygreat. I had doubted the relapse perhaps; possibly I had believed in it,but had not realized it.
Cauchon's victory was complete. He had had a harassed and irritated anddisgusted look for a long time, but that was all gone now, andcontentment and serenity had taken its place. His purple face was full oftranquil and malicious happiness. He went trailing his robes and stoodgrandly in front of Joan, with his legs apart, and remained so more thana minute, gloating over her and enjoying the sight of this poor ruinedcreature, who had won so lofty a place for him in the service of the meekand merciful Jesus, Saviour of the World, Lord of the Universe--in caseEngland kept her promise to him, who kept no promises himself.
Presently the judges began to question Joan. One of them, namedMarguerie, who was a man with more insight than prudence, remarked uponJoan's change of clothing, and said:
"There is something suspicious about this. How could it have come aboutwithout connivance on the part of others? Perhaps even something worse?"
"Thousand devils!" screamed Cauchon, in a fury. "Will you shut yourmouth?"
"Armagnac! Traitor!" shouted the soldiers on guard, and made a rush forMarguerie with their lances leveled. It was with the greatest difficultythat he was saved from being run through the body. He made no moreattempts to help the inquiry, poor man. The other judges proceeded withthe questionings.
"Why have you resumed this male habit?"
I did not quite catch her answer, for just then a soldier's halberdslipped from his fingers and fell on the stone floor with a crash; but Ithought I understood Joan to say that she had resumed it of her ownmotion.
"But you have promised and sworn that you would not go back to it."
I was full of anxiety to hear her answer to that question; and when itcame it was just what I was expecting. She said--quiet quietly:
"I have never intended and never understood myself to swear I would notresume it."
There--I had been sure, all along, that she did not know what she wasdoing and saying on the platform Thursday, and this answer of hers wasproof that I had not been mistaken. Then she went on to add this:
"But I had a right to resume it, because the promises made to me have notbeen kept--promises that I should be allowed to go to mass and receivethe communion, and that I should be freed from the bondage of thesechains--but they are still upon me, as you see."
"Nevertheless, you have abjured, and have especially promised to returnno more to the dress of a man."
Then Joan held out her fettered hands sorrowfully toward these unfeelingmen and said:
"I would rather die than continue so. But if they may be taken off, andif I may hear mass, and be removed to a penitential prison, and have awoman about me, I will be good, and will do what shall seem good to youthat I do."
Cauchon sniffed scoffingly at that. Honor the compact which he and hishad made with her?
Fulfil its conditions? What need of that? Conditions had been a goodthing to concede, temporarily, and for advantage; but they have servedtheir turn--let something of a fresher sort and of more consequence beconsidered. The resumption of the male dress was sufficient for allpractical purposes, but perhaps Joan could be led to add something tothat fatal crime. So Cauchon asked her if her Voices had spoken to hersince Thursday--and he reminded her of her abjuration.
"Yes," she answered; and then it came out that the Voices had talked withher about the abjuration--told her about it, I suppose. She guilelesslyreasserted the heavenly origin of her mission, and did it with theuntroubled mien of one who was not conscious that she had ever knowinglyrepudiated it. So I was convinced once more that she had had no notion ofwhat she was doing that Thursday morning on the platform. Finally shesaid, "My Voices told me I did very wrong to confess that what I had donewas not well." Then she sighed, and said with simplicity, "But it was thefear of the fire that made me do so."
That is, fear of the fire had made her sign a paper whose contents shehad not understood then, but understood now by revelation of her Voicesand by testimony of her persecutors.
She was sane now and not exhausted; her courage had come back, and withit her inborn loyalty to the truth. She was bravely and serenely speakingit again, knowing that it would deliver her body up to that very firewhich had such terrors for her.
That answer of hers was quite long, quite frank, wholly free fromconcealments or palliations. It made me shudder; I knew she waspronouncing sentence of death upon herself. So did poor Manchon. And hewrote in the margin abreast of it:
"RESPONSIO MORTIFERA."
Fatal answer. Yes, all present knew that it was, indeed, a fatal answer.Then there fell a silence such as falls in a sick-room when the watchersof the dying draw a deep breath and say softly one to another, "All isover."
Here, likewise, all was over; but after some moments Cauchon, wishing toclinch this matter and make it final, put this question:
"Do you still believe that your Voices are St. Marguerite and St.Catherine?"
"Yes--and that they come from God."
"Yet you denied them on the scaffold?"
Then she made direct and clear affirmation that she had never had anyintention to deny them; and that if--I noted the if--"if she had madesome retractions and revocations on the scaffold it was from fear of thefire, and it was a violation of the truth."
There it is again, you see. She certainly never knew what it was she haddone on the scaffold until she was told of it afterward by these peopleand by her Voices.
And now she closed this most painful scene with these words; and therewas a weary note in them that was pathetic:
"I would rather do my penance all at once; let me die. I cannot endurecaptivity any longer."
The spirit born for sunshine and liberty so longed for release that itwould take it in any form, even that.
Several among the company of judges went from the place troubled andsorrowful, the others in another mood. In the court of the castle wefound the Earl of Warwick and fifty English waiting, impatient for news.As soon as Cauchon saw them he shouted--laughing--think of a mandestroying a friendless poor girl and then having the heart to laugh atit:
"Make yourselves comfortable--it's all over with her!"
