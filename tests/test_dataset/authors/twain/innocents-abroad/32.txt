Home, again! For the first time, in many weeks, the ship's entire familymet and shook hands on the quarter-deck. They had gathered from manypoints of the compass and from many lands, but not one was missing; therewas no tale of sickness or death among the flock to dampen the pleasureof the reunion. Once more there was a full audience on deck to listen tothe sailors' chorus as they got the anchor up, and to wave an adieu tothe land as we sped away from Naples. The seats were full at dinneragain, the domino parties were complete, and the life and bustle on theupper deck in the fine moonlight at night was like old times--old timesthat had been gone weeks only, but yet they were weeks so crowded withincident, adventure and excitement, that they seemed almost like years.There was no lack of cheerfulness on board the Quaker City. For once,her title was a misnomer.
At seven in the evening, with the western horizon all golden from thesunken sun, and specked with distant ships, the full moon sailing highover head, the dark blue of the sea under foot, and a strange sort oftwilight affected by all these different lights and colors around us andabout us, we sighted superb Stromboli. With what majesty the monarchheld his lonely state above the level sea! Distance clothed him in apurple gloom, and added a veil of shimmering mist that so softened hisrugged features that we seemed to see him through a web of silver gauze.His torch was out; his fires were smoldering; a tall column of smoke thatrose up and lost itself in the growing moonlight was all the sign he gavethat he was a living Autocrat of the Sea and not the spectre of a deadone.
At two in the morning we swept through the Straits of Messina, and sobright was the moonlight that Italy on the one hand and Sicily on theother seemed almost as distinctly visible as though we looked at themfrom the middle of a street we were traversing. The city of Messina,milk-white, and starred and spangled all over with gaslights, was a fairyspectacle. A great party of us were on deck smoking and making a noise,and waiting to see famous Scylla and Charybdis. And presently the Oraclestepped out with his eternal spy-glass and squared himself on the decklike another Colossus of Rhodes. It was a surprise to see him abroad atsuch an hour. Nobody supposed he cared anything about an old fable likethat of Scylla and Charybdis. One of the boys said:
"Hello, doctor, what are you doing up here at this time of night?--Whatdo you want to see this place for?"
"What do I want to see this place for? Young man, little do you know me,or you wouldn't ask such a question. I wish to see all the places that'smentioned in the Bible."
"Stuff--this place isn't mentioned in the Bible."
"It ain't mentioned in the Bible!--this place ain't--well now, what placeis this, since you know so much about it?"
"Why it's Scylla and Charybdis."
"Scylla and Cha--confound it, I thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah!"
And he closed up his glass and went below. The above is the ship story.Its plausibility is marred a little by the fact that the Oracle was not abiblical student, and did not spend much of his time instructing himselfabout Scriptural localities.--They say the Oracle complains, in this hotweather, lately, that the only beverage in the ship that is passable, isthe butter. He did not mean butter, of course, but inasmuch as thatarticle remains in a melted state now since we are out of ice, it is fairto give him the credit of getting one long word in the right place,anyhow, for once in his life. He said, in Rome, that the Pope was anoble-looking old man, but he never did think much of his Iliad.
We spent one pleasant day skirting along the Isles of Greece. They arevery mountainous. Their prevailing tints are gray and brown, approachingto red. Little white villages surrounded by trees, nestle in the valleysor roost upon the lofty perpendicular sea-walls.
We had one fine sunset--a rich carmine flush that suffused the westernsky and cast a ruddy glow far over the sea.--Fine sunsets seem to berare in this part of the world--or at least, striking ones. They aresoft, sensuous, lovely--they are exquisite refined, effeminate, but wehave seen no sunsets here yet like the gorgeous conflagrations that flamein the track of the sinking sun in our high northern latitudes.
But what were sunsets to us, with the wild excitement upon us ofapproaching the most renowned of cities! What cared we for outwardvisions, when Agamemnon, Achilles, and a thousand other heroes of thegreat Past were marching in ghostly procession through our fancies? Whatwere sunsets to us, who were about to live and breathe and walk in actualAthens; yea, and go far down into the dead centuries and bid in personfor the slaves, Diogenes and Plato, in the public market-place, or gossipwith the neighbors about the siege of Troy or the splendid deeds ofMarathon? We scorned to consider sunsets.
We arrived, and entered the ancient harbor of the Piraeus at last. Wedropped anchor within half a mile of the village. Away off, across theundulating Plain of Attica, could be seen a little square-topped hillwith a something on it, which our glasses soon discovered to be theruined edifices of the citadel of the Athenians, and most prominent amongthem loomed the venerable Parthenon. So exquisitely clear and pure isthis wonderful atmosphere that every column of the noble structure wasdiscernible through the telescope, and even the smaller ruins about itassumed some semblance of shape. This at a distance of five or sixmiles. In the valley, near the Acropolis, (the square-topped hill beforespoken of,) Athens itself could be vaguely made out with an ordinarylorgnette. Every body was anxious to get ashore and visit these classiclocalities as quickly as possible. No land we had yet seen had arousedsuch universal interest among the passengers.
But bad news came. The commandant of the Piraeus came in his boat, andsaid we must either depart or else get outside the harbor and remainimprisoned in our ship, under rigid quarantine, for eleven days! So wetook up the anchor and moved outside, to lie a dozen hours or so, takingin supplies, and then sail for Constantinople. It was the bitterestdisappointment we had yet experienced. To lie a whole day in sight ofthe Acropolis, and yet be obliged to go away without visiting Athens!Disappointment was hardly a strong enough word to describe thecircumstances.
All hands were on deck, all the afternoon, with books and maps andglasses, trying to determine which "narrow rocky ridge" was theAreopagus, which sloping hill the Pnyx, which elevation the Museum Hill,and so on. And we got things confused. Discussion became heated, andparty spirit ran high. Church members were gazing with emotion upon ahill which they said was the one St. Paul preached from, and anotherfaction claimed that that hill was Hymettus, and another that it wasPentelicon! After all the trouble, we could be certain of only onething--the square-topped hill was the Acropolis, and the grand ruin thatcrowned it was the Parthenon, whose picture we knew in infancy in theschool books.
We inquired of every body who came near the ship, whether there wereguards in the Piraeus, whether they were strict, what the chances were ofcapture should any of us slip ashore, and in case any of us made theventure and were caught, what would be probably done to us? The answerswere discouraging: There was a strong guard or police force; the Piraeuswas a small town, and any stranger seen in it would surely attractattention--capture would be certain. The commandant said the punishmentwould be "heavy;" when asked "how heavy?" he said it would be "verysevere"--that was all we could get out of him.
At eleven o'clock at night, when most of the ship's company were abed,four of us stole softly ashore in a small boat, a clouded moon favoringthe enterprise, and started two and two, and far apart, over a low hill,intending to go clear around the Piraeus, out of the range of its police.Picking our way so stealthily over that rocky, nettle-grown eminence,made me feel a good deal as if I were on my way somewhere to stealsomething. My immediate comrade and I talked in an undertone aboutquarantine laws and their penalties, but we found nothing cheering in thesubject. I was posted. Only a few days before, I was talking with ourcaptain, and he mentioned the case of a man who swam ashore from aquarantined ship somewhere, and got imprisoned six months for it; andwhen he was in Genoa a few years ago, a captain of a quarantined shipwent in his boat to a departing ship, which was already outside of theharbor, and put a letter on board to be taken to his family, and theauthorities imprisoned him three months for it, and then conducted himand his ship fairly to sea, and warned him never to show himself in thatport again while he lived. This kind of conversation did no good,further than to give a sort of dismal interest to our quarantine-breakingexpedition, and so we dropped it. We made the entire circuit of the townwithout seeing any body but one man, who stared at us curiously, but saidnothing, and a dozen persons asleep on the ground before their doors,whom we walked among and never woke--but we woke up dogs enough, in allconscience--we always had one or two barking at our heels, and severaltimes we had as many as ten and twelve at once. They made such apreposterous din that persons aboard our ship said they could tell how wewere progressing for a long time, and where we were, by the barking ofthe dogs. The clouded moon still favored us. When we had made the wholecircuit, and were passing among the houses on the further side of thetown, the moon came out splendidly, but we no longer feared the light.As we approached a well, near a house, to get a drink, the owner merelyglanced at us and went within. He left the quiet, slumbering town at ourmercy. I record it here proudly, that we didn't do any thing to it.
Seeing no road, we took a tall hill to the left of the distant Acropolisfor a mark, and steered straight for it over all obstructions, and over alittle rougher piece of country than exists any where else outside of theState of Nevada, perhaps. Part of the way it was covered with small,loose stones--we trod on six at a time, and they all rolled. Anotherpart of it was dry, loose, newly-ploughed ground. Still another part ofit was a long stretch of low grape-vines, which were tanglesome andtroublesome, and which we took to be brambles. The Attic Plain, barringthe grape-vines, was a barren, desolate, unpoetical waste--I wonder whatit was in Greece's Age of Glory, five hundred years before Christ?
In the neighborhood of one o'clock in the morning, when we were heatedwith fast walking and parched with thirst, Denny exclaimed, "Why, theseweeds are grape-vines!" and in five minutes we had a score of bunches oflarge, white, delicious grapes, and were reaching down for more when adark shape rose mysteriously up out of the shadows beside us and said"Ho!" And so we left.
In ten minutes more we struck into a beautiful road, and unlike someothers we had stumbled upon at intervals, it led in the right direction.We followed it. It was broad, and smooth, and white--handsome and inperfect repair, and shaded on both sides for a mile or so with singleranks of trees, and also with luxuriant vineyards. Twice we entered andstole grapes, and the second time somebody shouted at us from someinvisible place. Whereupon we left again. We speculated in grapes nomore on that side of Athens.
Shortly we came upon an ancient stone aqueduct, built upon arches, andfrom that time forth we had ruins all about us--we were approaching ourjourney's end. We could not see the Acropolis now or the high hill,either, and I wanted to follow the road till we were abreast of them, butthe others overruled me, and we toiled laboriously up the stony hillimmediately in our front--and from its summit saw another--climbed it andsaw another! It was an hour of exhausting work. Soon we came upon a rowof open graves, cut in the solid rock--(for a while one of them servedSocrates for a prison)--we passed around the shoulder of the hill, andthe citadel, in all its ruined magnificence, burst upon us! We hurriedacross the ravine and up a winding road, and stood on the old Acropolis,with the prodigious walls of the citadel towering above our heads. Wedid not stop to inspect their massive blocks of marble, or measure theirheight, or guess at their extraordinary thickness, but passed at oncethrough a great arched passage like a railway tunnel, and went straightto the gate that leads to the ancient temples. It was locked! So, afterall, it seemed that we were not to see the great Parthenon face to face.We sat down and held a council of war. Result: the gate was only aflimsy structure of wood--we would break it down. It seemed likedesecration, but then we had traveled far, and our necessities wereurgent. We could not hunt up guides and keepers--we must be on the shipbefore daylight. So we argued. This was all very fine, but when we cameto break the gate, we could not do it. We moved around an angle of thewall and found a low bastion--eight feet high without--ten or twelvewithin. Denny prepared to scale it, and we got ready to follow. By dintof hard scrambling he finally straddled the top, but some loose stonescrumbled away and fell with a crash into the court within. There wasinstantly a banging of doors and a shout. Denny dropped from the wall ina twinkling, and we retreated in disorder to the gate. Xerxes took thatmighty citadel four hundred and eighty years before Christ, when his fivemillions of soldiers and camp-followers followed him to Greece, and if wefour Americans could have remained unmolested five minutes longer, wewould have taken it too.
The garrison had turned out--four Greeks. We clamored at the gate, andthey admitted us. [Bribery and corruption.]
We crossed a large court, entered a great door, and stood upon a pavementof purest white marble, deeply worn by footprints. Before us, in theflooding moonlight, rose the noblest ruins we had ever looked upon--thePropylae; a small Temple of Minerva; the Temple of Hercules, and thegrand Parthenon. [We got these names from the Greek guide, who didn'tseem to know more than seven men ought to know.] These edifices were allbuilt of the whitest Pentelic marble, but have a pinkish stain upon themnow. Where any part is broken, however, the fracture looks like fineloaf sugar. Six caryatides, or marble women, clad in flowing robes,support the portico of the Temple of Hercules, but the porticos andcolonnades of the other structures are formed of massive Doric and Ionicpillars, whose flutings and capitals are still measurably perfect,notwithstanding the centuries that have gone over them and the siegesthey have suffered. The Parthenon, originally, was two hundred andtwenty-six feet long, one hundred wide, and seventy high, and had tworows of great columns, eight in each, at either end, and single rows ofseventeen each down the sides, and was one of the most graceful andbeautiful edifices ever erected.
Most of the Parthenon's imposing columns are still standing, but the roofis gone. It was a perfect building two hundred and fifty years ago, whena shell dropped into the Venetian magazine stored here, and the explosionwhich followed wrecked and unroofed it. I remember but little about theParthenon, and I have put in one or two facts and figures for the use ofother people with short memories. Got them from the guide-book.
As we wandered thoughtfully down the marble-paved length of this statelytemple, the scene about us was strangely impressive. Here and there, inlavish profusion, were gleaming white statues of men and women, proppedagainst blocks of marble, some of them armless, some without legs, othersheadless--but all looking mournful in the moonlight, and startlinglyhuman! They rose up and confronted the midnight intruder on every side--they stared at him with stony eyes from unlooked-for nooks and recesses;they peered at him over fragmentary heaps far down the desolatecorridors; they barred his way in the midst of the broad forum, andsolemnly pointed with handless arms the way from the sacred fane; andthrough the roofless temple the moon looked down, and banded the floorand darkened the scattered fragments and broken statues with the slantingshadows of the columns.
What a world of ruined sculpture was about us! Set up in rows--stackedup in piles--scattered broadcast over the wide area of the Acropolis--were hundreds of crippled statues of all sizes and of the most exquisiteworkmanship; and vast fragments of marble that once belonged to theentablatures, covered with bas-reliefs representing battles and sieges,ships of war with three and four tiers of oars, pageants and processions--every thing one could think of. History says that the temples of theAcropolis were filled with the noblest works of Praxiteles and Phidias,and of many a great master in sculpture besides--and surely these elegantfragments attest it.
We walked out into the grass-grown, fragment-strewn court beyond theParthenon. It startled us, every now and then, to see a stony white facestare suddenly up at us out of the grass with its dead eyes. The placeseemed alive with ghosts. I half expected to see the Athenian heroes oftwenty centuries ago glide out of the shadows and steal into the oldtemple they knew so well and regarded with such boundless pride.
The full moon was riding high in the cloudless heavens, now. Wesauntered carelessly and unthinkingly to the edge of the loftybattlements of the citadel, and looked down--a vision! And such avision! Athens by moonlight! The prophet that thought the splendors ofthe New Jerusalem were revealed to him, surely saw this instead! It layin the level plain right under our feet--all spread abroad like apicture--and we looked down upon it as we might have looked from aballoon. We saw no semblance of a street, but every house, every window,every clinging vine, every projection was as distinct and sharply markedas if the time were noon-day; and yet there was no glare, no glitter,nothing harsh or repulsive--the noiseless city was flooded with themellowest light that ever streamed from the moon, and seemed like someliving creature wrapped in peaceful slumber. On its further side was alittle temple, whose delicate pillars and ornate front glowed with a richlustre that chained the eye like a spell; and nearer by, the palace ofthe king reared its creamy walls out of the midst of a great garden ofshrubbery that was flecked all over with a random shower of amber lights--a spray of golden sparks that lost their brightness in the glory of themoon, and glinted softly upon the sea of dark foliage like the pallidstars of the milky-way. Overhead the stately columns, majestic still intheir ruin--under foot the dreaming city--in the distance the silver sea--not on the broad earth is there an other picture half so beautiful!
As we turned and moved again through the temple, I wished that theillustrious men who had sat in it in the remote ages could visit it againand reveal themselves to our curious eyes--Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes,Socrates, Phocion, Pythagoras, Euclid, Pindar, Xenophon, Herodotus,Praxiteles and Phidias, Zeuxis the painter. What a constellation ofcelebrated names! But more than all, I wished that old Diogenes, gropingso patiently with his lantern, searching so zealously for one solitaryhonest man in all the world, might meander along and stumble on ourparty. I ought not to say it, may be, but still I suppose he would haveput out his light.
We left the Parthenon to keep its watch over old Athens, as it had keptit for twenty-three hundred years, and went and stood outside the wallsof the citadel. In the distance was the ancient, but still almostperfect Temple of Theseus, and close by, looking to the west, was theBema, from whence Demosthenes thundered his philippics and fired thewavering patriotism of his countrymen. To the right was Mars Hill, wherethe Areopagus sat in ancient times and where St. Paul defined hisposition, and below was the market-place where he "disputed daily" withthe gossip-loving Athenians. We climbed the stone steps St. Paulascended, and stood in the square-cut place he stood in, and tried torecollect the Bible account of the matter--but for certain reasons, Icould not recall the words. I have found them since:
 "Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given up to idolatry. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. * * * * * * * * * "And they took him and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is? * * * * * * * * * "Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious; For as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription: To THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom, therefore, ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you."--Acts, ch. xvii."
It occurred to us, after a while, that if we wanted to get home beforedaylight betrayed us, we had better be moving. So we hurried away. Whenfar on our road, we had a parting view of the Parthenon, with themoonlight streaming through its open colonnades and touching its capitalswith silver. As it looked then, solemn, grand, and beautiful it willalways remain in our memories.
As we marched along, we began to get over our fears, and ceased to caremuch about quarantine scouts or any body else. We grew bold andreckless; and once, in a sudden burst of courage, I even threw a stone ata dog. It was a pleasant reflection, though, that I did not hit him,because his master might just possibly have been a policeman. Inspiredby this happy failure, my valor became utterly uncontrollable, and atintervals I absolutely whistled, though on a moderate key. But boldnessbreeds boldness, and shortly I plunged into a Vineyard, in the full lightof the moon, and captured a gallon of superb grapes, not even minding thepresence of a peasant who rode by on a mule. Denny and Birch followed myexample.
Now I had grapes enough for a dozen, but then Jackson was all swollen upwith courage, too, and he was obliged to enter a vineyard presently. Thefirst bunch he seized brought trouble. A frowsy, bearded brigand spranginto the road with a shout, and flourished a musket in the light of themoon! We sidled toward the Piraeus--not running you understand, but onlyadvancing with celerity. The brigand shouted again, but still weadvanced. It was getting late, and we had no time to fool away on everyass that wanted to drivel Greek platitudes to us. We would just as soonhave talked with him as not if we had not been in a hurry. PresentlyDenny said, "Those fellows are following us!"
We turned, and, sure enough, there they were--three fantastic piratesarmed with guns. We slackened our pace to let them come up, and in themeantime I got out my cargo of grapes and dropped them firmly butreluctantly into the shadows by the wayside. But I was not afraid. Ionly felt that it was not right to steal grapes. And all the more sowhen the owner was around--and not only around, but with his friendsaround also. The villains came up and searched a bundle Dr. Birch had inhis hand, and scowled upon him when they found it had nothing in it butsome holy rocks from Mars Hill, and these were not contraband. Theyevidently suspected him of playing some wretched fraud upon them, andseemed half inclined to scalp the party. But finally they dismissed uswith a warning, couched in excellent Greek, I suppose, and droppedtranquilly in our wake. When they had gone three hundred yards theystopped, and we went on rejoiced. But behold, another armed rascal cameout of the shadows and took their place, and followed us two hundredyards. Then he delivered us over to another miscreant, who emerged fromsome mysterious place, and he in turn to another! For a mile and a halfour rear was guarded all the while by armed men. I never traveled in somuch state before in all my life.
It was a good while after that before we ventured to steal any moregrapes, and when we did we stirred up another troublesome brigand, andthen we ceased all further speculation in that line. I suppose thatfellow that rode by on the mule posted all the sentinels, from Athens tothe Piraeus, about us.
Every field on that long route was watched by an armed sentinel, some ofwhom had fallen asleep, no doubt, but were on hand, nevertheless. Thisshows what sort of a country modern Attica is--a community ofquestionable characters. These men were not there to guard theirpossessions against strangers, but against each other; for strangersseldom visit Athens and the Piraeus, and when they do, they go indaylight, and can buy all the grapes they want for a trifle. The moderninhabitants are confiscators and falsifiers of high repute, if gossipspeaks truly concerning them, and I freely believe it does.
Just as the earliest tinges of the dawn flushed the eastern sky andturned the pillared Parthenon to a broken harp hung in the pearlyhorizon, we closed our thirteenth mile of weary, round-about marching,and emerged upon the sea-shore abreast the ships, with our usual escortof fifteen hundred Piraean dogs howling at our heels. We hailed a boatthat was two or three hundred yards from shore, and discoveredin a moment that it was a police-boat on the lookout for anyquarantine-breakers that might chance to be abroad. So we dodged--wewere used to that by this time--and when the scouts reached the spot wehad so lately occupied, we were absent. They cruised along the shore,but in the wrong direction, and shortly our own boat issued from thegloom and took us aboard. They had heard our signal on the ship. Werowed noiselessly away, and before the police-boat came in sight again,we were safe at home once more.
Four more of our passengers were anxious to visit Athens, and startedhalf an hour after we returned; but they had not been ashore five minutestill the police discovered and chased them so hotly that they barelyescaped to their boat again, and that was all. They pursued theenterprise no further.
We set sail for Constantinople to-day, but some of us little care forthat. We have seen all there was to see in the old city that had itsbirth sixteen hundred years before Christ was born, and was an old townbefore the foundations of Troy were laid--and saw it in its mostattractive aspect. Wherefore, why should we worry?
Two other passengers ran the blockade successfully last night. So welearned this morning. They slipped away so quietly that they were notmissed from the ship for several hours. They had the hardihood to marchinto the Piraeus in the early dusk and hire a carriage. They ran somedanger of adding two or three months' imprisonment to the other noveltiesof their Holy Land Pleasure Excursion. I admire "cheek."--[Quotationfrom the Pilgrims.]--But they went and came safely, and never walked astep.
