About the first adventure we had yesterday afternoon, after landing here,came near finishing that heedless Blucher. We had just mounted somemules and asses and started out under the guardianship of the stately,the princely, the magnificent Hadji Muhammad Lamarty (may his tribeincrease!) when we came upon a fine Moorish mosque, with tall tower, richwith checker-work of many-colored porcelain, and every part and portionof the edifice adorned with the quaint architecture of the Alhambra, andBlucher started to ride into the open doorway. A startling "Hi-hi!" fromour camp followers and a loud "Halt!" from an English gentleman in theparty checked the adventurer, and then we were informed that so dire aprofanation is it for a Christian dog to set foot upon the sacredthreshold of a Moorish mosque that no amount of purification can evermake it fit for the faithful to pray in again. Had Blucher succeeded inentering the place, he would no doubt have been chased through the townand stoned; and the time has been, and not many years ago, either, when aChristian would have been most ruthlessly slaughtered if captured in amosque. We caught a glimpse of the handsome tessellated pavements withinand of the devotees performing their ablutions at the fountains, but eventhat we took that glimpse was a thing not relished by the Moorishbystanders.
Some years ago the clock in the tower of the mosque got out of order.The Moors of Tangier have so degenerated that it has been long sincethere was an artificer among them capable of curing so delicate a patientas a debilitated clock. The great men of the city met in solemn conclaveto consider how the difficulty was to be met. They discussed the matterthoroughly but arrived at no solution. Finally, a patriarch arose andsaid:
"Oh, children of the Prophet, it is known unto you that a Portuguee dogof a Christian clock mender pollutes the city of Tangier with hispresence. Ye know, also, that when mosques are builded, asses bear thestones and the cement, and cross the sacred threshold. Now, therefore,send the Christian dog on all fours, and barefoot, into the holy place tomend the clock, and let him go as an ass!"
And in that way it was done. Therefore, if Blucher ever sees the insideof a mosque, he will have to cast aside his humanity and go in hisnatural character. We visited the jail and found Moorish prisonersmaking mats and baskets. (This thing of utilizing crime savors ofcivilization.) Murder is punished with death. A short time ago threemurderers were taken beyond the city walls and shot. Moorish guns arenot good, and neither are Moorish marksmen. In this instance they set upthe poor criminals at long range, like so many targets, and practiced onthem--kept them hopping about and dodging bullets for half an hour beforethey managed to drive the center.
When a man steals cattle, they cut off his right hand and left leg andnail them up in the marketplace as a warning to everybody. Their surgeryis not artistic. They slice around the bone a little, then break off thelimb. Sometimes the patient gets well; but, as a general thing, hedon't. However, the Moorish heart is stout. The Moors were alwaysbrave. These criminals undergo the fearful operation without a wince,without a tremor of any kind, without a groan! No amount of sufferingcan bring down the pride of a Moor or make him shame his dignity with acry.
Here, marriage is contracted by the parents of the parties to it. Thereare no valentines, no stolen interviews, no riding out, no courting indim parlors, no lovers' quarrels and reconciliations--no nothing that isproper to approaching matrimony. The young man takes the girl his fatherselects for him, marries her, and after that she is unveiled, and he seesher for the first time. If after due acquaintance she suits him, heretains her; but if he suspects her purity, he bundles her back to herfather; if he finds her diseased, the same; or if, after just andreasonable time is allowed her, she neglects to bear children, back shegoes to the home of her childhood.
Muhammadans here who can afford it keep a good many wives on hand. Theyare called wives, though I believe the Koran only allows four genuinewives--the rest are concubines. The Emperor of Morocco don't know howmany wives he has, but thinks he has five hundred. However, that is nearenough--a dozen or so, one way or the other, don't matter.
Even the Jews in the interior have a plurality of wives.
I have caught a glimpse of the faces of several Moorish women (for theyare only human, and will expose their faces for the admiration of aChristian dog when no male Moor is by), and I am full of veneration forthe wisdom that leads them to cover up such atrocious ugliness.
They carry their children at their backs, in a sack, like other savagesthe world over.
Many of the Negroes are held in slavery by the Moors. But the moment afemale slave becomes her master's concubine her bonds are broken, and assoon as a male slave can read the first chapter of the Koran (whichcontains the creed) he can no longer be held in bondage.
They have three Sundays a week in Tangier. The Muhammadans' comes onFriday, the Jews' on Saturday, and that of the Christian Consuls onSunday. The Jews are the most radical. The Moor goes to his mosqueabout noon on his Sabbath, as on any other day, removes his shoes at thedoor, performs his ablutions, makes his salaams, pressing his forehead tothe pavement time and again, says his prayers, and goes back to his work.
But the Jew shuts up shop; will not touch copper or bronze money at all;soils his fingers with nothing meaner than silver and gold; attends thesynagogue devoutly; will not cook or have anything to do with fire; andreligiously refrains from embarking in any enterprise.
The Moor who has made a pilgrimage to Mecca is entitled to highdistinction. Men call him Hadji, and he is thenceforward a greatpersonage. Hundreds of Moors come to Tangier every year and embark forMecca. They go part of the way in English steamers, and the ten ortwelve dollars they pay for passage is about all the trip costs. Theytake with them a quantity of food, and when the commissary departmentfails they "skirmish," as Jack terms it in his sinful, slangy way. Fromthe time they leave till they get home again, they never wash, either onland or sea. They are usually gone from five to seven months, and asthey do not change their clothes during all that time, they are totallyunfit for the drawing room when they get back.
Many of them have to rake and scrape a long time to gather together theten dollars their steamer passage costs, and when one of them gets backhe is a bankrupt forever after. Few Moors can ever build up theirfortunes again in one short lifetime after so reckless an outlay. Inorder to confine the dignity of Hadji to gentlemen of patrician blood andpossessions, the Emperor decreed that no man should make the pilgrimagesave bloated aristocrats who were worth a hundred dollars in specie. Butbehold how iniquity can circumvent the law! For a consideration, theJewish money-changer lends the pilgrim one hundred dollars long enoughfor him to swear himself through, and then receives it back before theship sails out of the harbor!
Spain is the only nation the Moors fear. The reason is that Spain sendsher heaviest ships of war and her loudest guns to astonish these Muslims,while America and other nations send only a little contemptible tub of agunboat occasionally. The Moors, like other savages, learn by what theysee, not what they hear or read. We have great fleets in theMediterranean, but they seldom touch at African ports. The Moors have asmall opinion of England, France, and America, and put theirrepresentatives to a deal of red-tape circumlocution before they grantthem their common rights, let alone a favor. But the moment the Spanishminister makes a demand, it is acceded to at once, whether it be just ornot.
Spain chastised the Moors five or six years ago, about a disputed pieceof property opposite Gibraltar, and captured the city of Tetouan. Shecompromised on an augmentation of her territory, twenty million dollars'indemnity in money, and peace. And then she gave up the city. But shenever gave it up until the Spanish soldiers had eaten up all the cats.They would not compromise as long as the cats held out. Spaniards arevery fond of cats. On the contrary, the Moors reverence cats assomething sacred. So the Spaniards touched them on a tender point thattime. Their unfeline conduct in eating up all the Tetouan cats aroused ahatred toward them in the breasts of the Moors, to which even the drivingthem out of Spain was tame and passionless. Moors and Spaniards are foesforever now. France had a minister here once who embittered the nationagainst him in the most innocent way. He killed a couple of battalionsof cats (Tangier is full of them) and made a parlor carpet out of theirhides. He made his carpet in circles--first a circle of old graytomcats, with their tails all pointing toward the center; then a circleof yellow cats; next a circle of black cats and a circle of white ones;then a circle of all sorts of cats; and, finally, a centerpiece ofassorted kittens. It was very beautiful, but the Moors curse his memoryto this day.
When we went to call on our American Consul General today I noticed thatall possible games for parlor amusement seemed to be represented on hiscenter tables. I thought that hinted at lonesomeness. The idea wascorrect. His is the only American family in Tangier. There are manyforeign consuls in this place, but much visiting is not indulged in.Tangier is clear out of the world, and what is the use of visiting whenpeople have nothing on earth to talk about? There is none. So eachconsul's family stays at home chiefly and amuses itself as best it can.Tangier is full of interest for one day, but after that it is a wearyprison. The Consul General has been here five years, and has got enoughof it to do him for a century, and is going home shortly. His familyseize upon their letters and papers when the mail arrives, read them overand over again for two days or three, talk them over and over again fortwo or three more till they wear them out, and after that for daystogether they eat and drink and sleep, and ride out over the same oldroad, and see the same old tiresome things that even decades of centurieshave scarcely changed, and say never a single word! They have literallynothing whatever to talk about. The arrival of an American man-of-war isa godsend to them. "O Solitude, where are the charms which sages haveseen in thy face?" It is the completest exile that I can conceive of.I would seriously recommend to the government of the United States thatwhen a man commits a crime so heinous that the law provides no adequatepunishment for it, they make him Consul General to Tangier.
I am glad to have seen Tangier--the second-oldest town in the world. ButI am ready to bid it good-bye, I believe.
We shall go hence to Gibraltar this evening or in the morning, anddoubtless the Quaker City will sail from that port within the nextforty-eight hours.
