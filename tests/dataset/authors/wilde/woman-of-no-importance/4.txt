SCENE
Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot's. Large open French window atback, looking on to garden. Doors R.C. and L.C.
[GERALD ARBUTHNOT writing at table.]
[Enter ALICE R.C. followed by LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS. ALLONBY.]
ALICE. Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby.
[Exit L.C.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Good morning, Gerald.
GERALD. [Rising.] Good morning, Lady Hunstanton. Good morning,Mrs. Allonby.
LADY HUNSTANTON. [Sitting down.] We came to inquire for your dearmother, Gerald. I hope she is better?
GERALD. My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for herlast night. I think there must have been thunder in the air. Orperhaps it was the music. Music makes one feel so romantic - atleast it always gets on one's nerves.
MRS. ALLONBY. It's the same thing, nowadays.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I am so glad I don't know what you mean, dear. Iam afraid you mean something wrong. Ah, I see you're examiningMrs. Arbuthnot's pretty room. Isn't it nice and old-fashioned?
MRS. ALLONBY. [Surveying the room through her lorgnette.] Itlooks quite the happy English home.
LADY HUNSTANTON. That's just the word, dear; that just describesit. One feels your mother's good influence in everything she hasabout her, Gerald.
MRS. ALLONBY. Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, butthat a good influence is the worst in the world.
LADY HUNSTANTON. When Lord Illingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot betterhe will change his mind. I must certainly bring him here.
MRS. ALLONBY. I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happyEnglish home.
LADY HUNSTANTON. It would do him a great deal of good, dear. Mostwomen in London, nowadays, seem to furnish their rooms with nothingbut orchids, foreigners, and French novels. But here we have theroom of a sweet saint. Fresh natural flowers, books that don'tshock one, pictures that one can look at without blushing.
MRS. ALLONBY. But I like blushing.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, there IS a good deal to be said forblushing, if one can do it at the proper moment. Poor dearHunstanton used to tell me I didn't blush nearly often enough. Butthen he was so very particular. He wouldn't let me know any of hismen friends, except those who were over seventy, like poor LordAshton: who afterwards, by the way, was brought into the DivorceCourt. A most unfortunate case.
MRS. ALLONBY. I delight in men over seventy. They always offerone the devotion of a lifetime. I think seventy an ideal age for aman.
LADY HUNSTANTON. She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn't she?By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see memore often now. You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately,don't you?
GERALD. I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth'ssecretary.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Surely not, Gerald! It would be most unwise ofyou. What reason can you have?
GERALD. I don't think I should be suitable for the post.
MRS. ALLONBY. I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be hissecretary. But he says I am not serious enough.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear, you really mustn't talk like that inthis house. Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn't know anything about the wickedsociety in which we all live. She won't go into it. She is fartoo good. I consider it was a great honour her coming to me lastnight. It gave quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunderin the air.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear, how can you say that? There is noresemblance between the two things at all. But really, Gerald,what do you mean by not being suitable?
GERALD. Lord Illingworth's views of life and mine are toodifferent.
LADY HUNSTANTON. But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn'thave any views of life. They are quite out of place. You must beguided by others in this matter. Lord Illingworth has made you themost flattering offer, and travelling with him you would see theworld - as much of it, at least, as one should look at - under thebest auspices possible, and stay with all the right people, whichis so important at this solemn moment in your career.
GERALD. I don't want to see the world: I've seen enough of it.
MRS. ALLONBY. I hope you don't think you have exhausted life, Mr.Arbuthnot. When a man says that, one knows that life has exhaustedhim.
GERALD. I don't wish to leave my mother.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part.Not leave your mother! If I were your mother I would insist onyour going.
[Enter ALICE L.C.]
ALICE. Mrs. Arbuthnot's compliments, my lady, but she has a badheadache, and cannot see any one this morning. [Exit R.C.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. [Rising.] A bad headache! I am so sorry!Perhaps you'll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she isbetter, Gerald.
GERALD. I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, to-morrow, then. Ah, if you had a father,Gerald, he wouldn't let you waste your life here. He would sendyou off with Lord Illingworth at once. But mothers are so weak.They give up to their sons in everything. We are all heart, allheart. Come, dear, I must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs.Daubeny, who, I am afraid, is far from well. It is wonderful howthe Archdeacon bears up, quite wonderful. He is the mostsympathetic of husbands. Quite a model. Good-bye, Gerald, give myfondest love to your mother.
MRS. ALLONBY. Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot.
GERALD. Good-bye.
[Exit LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS. ALLONBY. GERALD sits down and readsover his letter.]
GERALD. What name can I sign? I, who have no right to any name.[Signs name, puts letter into envelope, addresses it, and is aboutto seal it, when door L.C. opens and MRS. ARBUTHNOT enters. GERALDlays down sealing-wax. Mother and son look at each other.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. [Through French window at the back.] Good-byeagain, Gerald. We are taking the short cut across your prettygarden. Now, remember my advice to you - start at once with LordIllingworth.
MRS. ALLONBY. AU REVOIR, Mr. Arbuthnot. Mind you bring me backsomething nice from your travels - not an Indian shawl - on noaccount an Indian shawl.
[Exeunt.]
GERALD. Mother, I have just written to him.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. To whom?
GERALD. To my father. I have written to tell him to come here atfour o'clock this afternoon.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He shall not come here. He shall not cross thethreshold of my house.
GERALD. He must come.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald, if you are going away with LordIllingworth, go at once. Go before it kills me: but don't ask meto meet him.
GERALD. Mother, you don't understand. Nothing in the world wouldinduce me to go away with Lord Illingworth, or to leave you.Surely you know me well enough for that. No: I have written to himto say -
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. What can you have to say to him?
GERALD. Can't you guess, mother, what I have written in thisletter?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. No.
GERALD. Mother, surely you can. Think, think what must be done,now, at once, within the next few days.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. There is nothing to be done.
GERALD. I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him that hemust marry you.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Marry me?
GERALD. Mother, I will force him to do it. The wrong that hasbeen done you must be repaired. Atonement must be made. Justicemay be slow, mother, but it comes in the end. In a few days youshall be Lord Illingworth's lawful wife.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. But, Gerald -
GERALD. I will insist upon his doing it. I will make him do it:he will not dare to refuse.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. But, Gerald, it is I who refuse. I will not marryLord Illingworth.
GERALD. Not marry him? Mother!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I will not marry him.
GERALD. But you don't understand: it is for your sake I amtalking, not for mine. This marriage, this necessary marriage,this marriage which for obvious reasons must inevitably take place,will not help me, will not give me a name that will be really,rightly mine to bear. But surely it will be something for you,that you, my mother, should, however late, become the wife of theman who is my father. Will not that be something?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I will not marry him.
GERALD. Mother, you must.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I will not. You talk of atonement for a wrongdone. What atonement can be made to me? There is no atonementpossible. I am disgraced: he is not. That is all. It is theusual history of a man and a woman as it usually happens, as italways happens. And the ending is the ordinary ending. The womansuffers. The man goes free.
GERALD. I don't know if that is the ordinary ending, mother: Ihope it is not. But your life, at any rate, shall not end likethat. The man shall make whatever reparation is possible. It isnot enough. It does not wipe out the past, I know that. But atleast it makes the future better, better for you, mother.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I refuse to marry Lord Illingworth.
GERALD. If he came to you himself and asked you to be his wife youwould give him a different answer. Remember, he is my father.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. If he came himself, which he will not do, myanswer would be the same. Remember I am your mother.
GERALD. Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by talkinglike that; and I can't understand why you won't look at this matterfrom the right, from the only proper standpoint. It is to takeaway the bitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow thatlies on your name, that this marriage must take place. There is noalternative: and after the marriage you and I can go away together.But the marriage must take place first. It is a duty that you owe,not merely to yourself, but to all other women - yes: to all theother women in the world, lest he betray more.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I owe nothing to other women. There is not one ofthem to help me. There is not one woman in the world to whom Icould go for pity, if I would take it, or for sympathy, if I couldwin it. Women are hard on each other. That girl, last night, goodthough she is, fled from the room as though I were a tainted thing.She was right. I am a tainted thing. But my wrongs are my own,and I will bear them alone. I must bear them alone. What havewomen who have not sinned to do with me, or I with them? We do notunderstand each other.
[Enter HESTER behind.]
GERALD. I implore you to do what I ask you.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. What son has ever asked of his mother to make sohideous a sacrifice? None.
GERALD. What mother has ever refused to marry the father of herown child? None.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Let me be the first, then. I will not do it.
GERALD. Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought me up tobelieve in it also. Well, surely your religion, the religion thatyou taught me when I was a boy, mother, must tell you that I amright. You know it, you feel it.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I do not know it. I do not feel it, nor will Iever stand before God's altar and ask God's blessing on so hideousa mockery as a marriage between me and George Harford. I will notsay the words the Church bids us to say. I will not say them. Idare not. How could I swear to love the man I loathe, to honourhim who wrought you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery,made me to sin? No: marriage is a sacrament for those who loveeach other. It is not for such as him, or such as me. Gerald, tosave you from the world's sneers and taunts I have lied to theworld. For twenty years I have lied to the world. I could nottell the world the truth. Who can, ever? But not for my own sakewill I lie to God, and in God's presence. No, Gerald, no ceremony,Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind me to GeorgeHarford. It may be that I am too bound to him already, who,robbing me, yet left me richer, so that in the mire of my life Ifound the pearl of price, or what I thought would be so.
GERALD. I don't understand you now.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Men don't understand what mothers are. I am nodifferent from other women except in the wrong done me and thewrong I did, and my very heavy punishments and great disgrace. Andyet, to bear you I had to look on death. To nurture you I had towrestle with it. Death fought with me for you. All women have tofight with death to keep their children. Death, being childless,wants our children from us. Gerald, when you were naked I clothedyou, when you were hungry I gave you food. Night and day all thatlong winter I tended you. No office is too mean, no care too lowlyfor the thing we women love - and oh! how I loved YOU. Not Hannah,Samuel more. And you needed love, for you were weakly, and onlylove could have kept you alive. Only love can keep any one alive.And boys are careless often and without thinking give pain, and wealways fancy that when they come to man's estate and know us betterthey will repay us. But it is not so. The world draws them fromour side, and they make friends with whom they are happier thanthey are with us, and have amusements from which we are barred, andinterests that are not ours: and they are unjust to us often, forwhen they find life bitter they blame us for it, and when they findit sweet we do not taste its sweetness with them . . . You mademany friends and went into their houses and were glad with them,and I, knowing my secret, did not dare to follow, but stayed athome and closed the door, shut out the sun and sat in darkness.What should I have done in honest households? My past was everwith me. . . . And you thought I didn't care for the pleasantthings of life. I tell you I longed for them, but did not dare totouch them, feeling I had no right. You thought I was happierworking amongst the poor. That was my mission, you imagined. Itwas not, but where else was I to go? The sick do not ask if thehand that smooths their pillow is pure, nor the dying care if thelips that touch their brow have known the kiss of sin. It was youI thought of all the time; I gave to them the love you did notneed: lavished on them a love that was not theirs . . . And youthought I spent too much of my time in going to Church, and inChurch duties. But where else could I turn? God's house is theonly house where sinners are made welcome, and you were always inmy heart, Gerald, too much in my heart. For, though day after day,at morn or evensong, I have knelt in God's house, I have neverrepented of my sin. How could I repent of my sin when you, mylove, were its fruit! Even now that you are bitter to me I cannotrepent. I do not. You are more to me than innocence. I wouldrather be your mother - oh! much rather! - than have been alwayspure . . . Oh, don't you see? don't you understand? It is mydishonour that has made you so dear to me. It is my disgrace thathas bound you so closely to me. It is the price I paid for you -the price of soul and body - that makes me love you as I do. Oh,don't ask me to do this horrible thing. Child of my shame, bestill the child of my shame!
GERALD. Mother, I didn't know you loved me so much as that. And Iwill be a better son to you than I have been. And you and I mustnever leave each other . . . but, mother . . . I can't help it . .. you must become my father's wife. You must marry him. It isyour duty.
HESTER. [Running forwards and embracing MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] No, no;you shall not. That would be real dishonour, the first you haveever known. That would be real disgrace: the first to touch you.Leave him and come with me. There are other countries than England. . . Oh! other countries over sea, better, wiser, and less unjustlands. The world is very wide and very big.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. No, not for me. For me the world is shrivelled toa palm's breadth, and where I walk there are thorns.
HESTER. It shall not be so. We shall somewhere find green valleysand fresh waters, and if we weep, well, we shall weep together.Have we not both loved him?
GERALD. Hester!
HESTER. [Waving him back.] Don't, don't! You cannot love me atall, unless you love her also. You cannot honour me, unless she'sholier to you. In her all womanhood is martyred. Not she alone,but all of us are stricken in her house.
GERALD. Hester, Hester, what shall I do?
HESTER. Do you respect the man who is your father?
GERALD. Respect him? I despise him! He is infamous.
HESTER. I thank you for saving me from him last night.
GERALD. Ah, that is nothing. I would die to save you. But youdon't tell me what to do now!
HESTER. Have I not thanked you for saving ME?
GERALD. But what should I do?
HESTER. Ask your own heart, not mine. I never had a mother tosave, or shame.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He is hard - he is hard. Let me go away.
GERALD. [Rushes over and kneels down bedside his mother.] Mother,forgive me: I have been to blame.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Don't kiss my hands: they are cold. My heart iscold: something has broken it.
HESTER, Ah, don't say that. Hearts live by being wounded.Pleasure may turn a heart to stone, riches may make it callous, butsorrow - oh, sorrow cannot break it. Besides, what sorrows haveyou now? Why, at this moment you are more dear to him than ever,DEAR though you have BEEN, and oh! how dear you HAVE been always.Ah! be kind to him.
GERALD. You are my mother and my father all in one. I need nosecond parent. It was for you I spoke, for you alone. Oh, saysomething, mother. Have I but found one love to lose another?Don't tell me that. O mother, you are cruel. [Gets up and flingshimself sobbing on a sofa.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [To HESTER.] But has he found indeed anotherlove?
HESTER. You know I have loved him always.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. But we are very poor.
HESTER. Who, being loved, is poor? Oh, no one. I hate my riches.They are a burden. Let him share it with me.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. But we are disgraced. We rank among the outcastsGerald is nameless. The sins of the parents should be visited onthe children. It is God's law.
HESTER. I was wrong. God's law is only Love.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [Rises, and taking HESTER by the hand, goes slowlyover to where GERALD is lying on the sofa with his head buried inhis hands. She touches him and he looks up.] Gerald, I cannotgive you a father, but I have brought you a wife.
GERALD. Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. So she comes first, you are worthy. And when youare away, Gerald . . . with . . . her - oh, think of me sometimes.Don't forget me. And when you pray, pray for me. We should praywhen we are happiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.
HESTER. Oh, you don't think of leaving us?
GERALD. Mother, you won't leave us?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I might bring shame upon you!
GERALD. Mother!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. For a little then: and if you let me, near youalways.
HESTER. [To MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] Come out with us to the garden.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Later on, later on. [Exeunt HESTER and GERALD.MRS. ARBUTHNOT goes towards door L.C. Stops at looking-glass overmantelpiece and looks into it. Enter ALICE R.C.]
ALICE. A gentleman to see you, ma'am.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Say I am not at home. Show me the card. [Takescard from salver and looks at it.] Say I will not see him.
[LORD ILLINGWORTH enters. MRS. ARBUTHNOT sees him in the glass andstarts, but does not turn round. Exit ALICE.] What can you haveto say to me to-day, George Harford? You can have nothing to sayto me. You must leave this house.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and menow, so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us allthree. I assure you, he will find in me the most charming andgenerous of fathers.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. My son may come in at any moment. I saved youlast night. I may not be able to save you again. My son feels mydishonour strongly, terribly strongly. I beg you to go.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Sitting down.] Last night was excessivelyunfortunate. That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely becauseI wanted to kiss her. What harm is there in a kiss?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [Turning round.] A kiss may ruin a human life,George Harford. I know that. I know that too well.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. We won't discuss that at present. What is ofimportance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son. I am extremelyfond of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, Iadmired his conduct last night immensely. He took up the cudgelsfor that pretty prude with wonderful promptitude. He is just whatI should have liked a son of mine to be. Except that no son ofmine should ever take the side of the Puritans: that is always anerror. Now, what I propose is this.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yoursinterests me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. According to our ridiculous English laws, Ican't legitimise Gerald. But I can leave him my property.Illingworth is entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack ofa place. He can have Ashby, which is much prettier, Harborough,which has the best shooting in the north of England, and the housein St. James Square. What more can a gentleman require in thisworld?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Nothing more, I am quite sure.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. As for a title, a title is really rather anuisance in these democratic days. As George Harford I hadeverything I wanted. Now I have merely everything that otherpeople want, which isn't nearly so pleasant. Well, my proposal isthis.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I told you I was not interested, and I beg you togo.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. The boy is to be with you for six months in theyear, and with me for the other six. That is perfectly fair, is itnot? You can have whatever allowance you like, and live where youchoose. As for your past, no one knows anything about it exceptmyself and Gerald. There is the Puritan, of course, the Puritan inwhite muslin, but she doesn't count. She couldn't tell the storywithout explaining that she objected to being kissed, could she?And all the women would think her a fool and the men think her abore. And you need not be afraid that Gerald won't be my heir. Ineedn't tell you I have not the slightest intention of marrying.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You come too late. My son has no need of you.
You are not necessary.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What do you mean, Rachel?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. That you are not necessary to Gerald's career. Hedoes not require you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I do not understand you.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Look into the garden. [LORD ILLINGWORTH rises andgoes towards window.] You had better not let them see you: youbring unpleasant memories. [LORD ILLINGWORTH looks out andstarts.] She loves him. They love each other. We are safe fromyou, and we are going away.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Where?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. We will not tell you, and if you find us we willnot know you. You seem surprised. What welcome would you get fromthe girl whose lips you tried to soil, from the boy whose life youhave shamed, from the mother whose dishonour comes from you?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You have grown hard, Rachel.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I was too weak once. It is well for me that Ihave changed.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I was very young at the time. We men know lifetoo early.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. And we women know life too late. That is thedifference between men and women. [A pause.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Rachel, I want my son. My money may be of nouse to him now. I may be of no use to him, but I want my son.Bring us together, Rachel. You can do it if you choose. [Seesletter on table.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. There is no room in my boy's life for you. He isnot interested in YOU.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Then why does he write to me?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. What do you mean?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What letter is this? [Takes up letter.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. That - is nothing. Give it to me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is addressed to ME.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You are not to open it. I forbid you to open it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. And in Gerald's handwriting.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It was not to have been sent. It is a letter hewrote to you this morning, before he saw me. But he is sorry nowhe wrote it, very sorry. You are not to open it. Give it to me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It belongs to me. [Opens it, sits down andreads it slowly. MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches him all the time.] Youhave read this letter, I suppose, Rachel?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. No.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You know what is in it?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Yes!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I don't admit for a moment that the boy is rightin what he says. I don't admit that it is any duty of mine tomarry you. I deny it entirely. But to get my son back I am ready- yes, I am ready to marry you, Rachel - and to treat you alwayswith the deference and respect due to my wife. I will marry you assoon as you choose. I give you my word of honour.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You made that promise to me once before and brokeit.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I will keep it now. And that will show you thatI love my son, at least as much as you love him. For when I marryyou, Rachel, there are some ambitions I shall have to surrender.High ambitions, too, if any ambition is high.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Are you serious?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Yes.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Do tell me your reasons. They would interest meenormously.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I have already explained them to my son.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I suppose they were intensely sentimental,weren't they? You women live by your emotions and for them. Youhave no philosophy of life.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You are right. We women live by our emotions andfor them. By our passions, and for them, if you will. I have twopassions, Lord Illingworth: my love of him, my hate of you. Youcannot kill those. They feed each other.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What sort of love is that which needs to havehate as its brother?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It is the sort of love I have for Gerald. Do youthink that terrible? Well it is terrible. All love is terrible.All love is a tragedy. I loved you once, Lord Illingworth. Oh,what a tragedy for a woman to have loved you!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. So you really refuse to marry me?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Yes.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Because you hate me?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Yes.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. And does my son hate me as you do?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. No.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I am glad of that, Rachel.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He merely despises you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What a pity! What a pity for him, I mean.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Don't be deceived, George. Children begin byloving their parents. After a time they judge them. Rarely ifever do they forgive them.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Reads letter over again, very slowly.] May Iask by what arguments you made the boy who wrote this letter, thisbeautiful, passionate letter, believe that you should not marry hisfather, the father of your own child?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It was not I who made him see it. It was another.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What FIN-DE-SIECLE person?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. The Puritan, Lord Illingworth. [A pause.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Winces, then rises slowly and goes over totable where his hat and gloves are. MRS. ARBUTHNOT is standingclose to the table. He picks up one of the gloves, and beginspulling it on.] There is not much then for me to do here, Rachel?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Nothing.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is good-bye, is it?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. For ever, I hope, this time, Lord Illingworth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. How curious! At this moment you look exactly asyou looked the night you left me twenty years ago. You have justthe same expression in your mouth. Upon my word, Rachel, no womanever loved me as you did. Why, you gave yourself to me like aflower, to do anything I liked with. You were the prettiest ofplaythings, the most fascinating of small romances . . . [Pulls outwatch.] Quarter to two! Must be strolling back to Hunstanton.Don't suppose I shall see you there again. I'm sorry, I am,really. It's been an amusing experience to have met amongst peopleof one's own rank, and treated quite seriously too, one's mistress,and one's -
[MRS. ARBUTHNOT snatches up glove and strikes LORD ILLINGWORTHacross the face with it. LORD ILLINGWORTH starts. He is dazed bythe insult of his punishment. Then he controls himself, and goesto window and looks out at his son. Sighs and leaves the room.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [Falls sobbing on the sofa.] He would have saidit. He would have said it.
[Enter GERALD and HESTER from the garden.]
GERALD. Well, dear mother. You never came out after all. So wehave come in to fetch you. Mother, you have not been crying?[Kneels down beside her.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. My boy! My boy! My boy! [Running her fingersthrough his hair.]
HESTER. [Coming over.] But you have two children now. You'll letme be your daughter?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [Looking up.] Would you choose me for a mother?
HESTER. You of all women I have ever known.
[They move towards the door leading into garden with their armsround each other's waists. GERALD goes to table L.C. for his hat.On turning round he sees LORD ILLINGWORTH'S glove lying on thefloor, and picks it up.]
GERALD. Hallo, mother, whose glove is this? You have had avisitor. Who was it?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. [Turning round.] Oh! no one. No one inparticular. A man of no importance.
CURTAIN
