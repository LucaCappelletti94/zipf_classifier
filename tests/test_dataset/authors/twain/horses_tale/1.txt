I am Buffalo Bill's horse.  I have spent my life under his saddle -with him in it, too, and he is good for two hundred pounds, withouthis clothes; and there is no telling how much he does weigh when heis out on the war-path and has his batteries belted on.  He is oversix feet, is young, hasn't an ounce of waste flesh, is straight,graceful, springy in his motions, quick as a cat, and has ahandsome face, and black hair dangling down on his shoulders, andis beautiful to look at; and nobody is braver than he is, andnobody is stronger, except myself.  Yes, a person that doubts thathe is fine to see should see him in his beaded buck-skins, on myback and his rifle peeping above his shoulder, chasing a hostiletrail, with me going like the wind and his hair streaming outbehind from the shelter of his broad slouch.  Yes, he is a sight tolook at then - and I'm part of it myself.
I am his favorite horse, out of dozens.  Big as he is, I havecarried him eighty-one miles between nightfall and sunrise on thescout; and I am good for fifty, day in and day out, and all thetime.  I am not large, but I am built on a business basis.  I havecarried him thousands and thousands of miles on scout duty for thearmy, and there's not a gorge, nor a pass, nor a valley, nor afort, nor a trading post, nor a buffalo-range in the whole sweep ofthe Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains that we don't know as wellas we know the bugle-calls.  He is Chief of Scouts to the Army ofthe Frontier, and it makes us very important.  In such a positionas I hold in the military service one needs to be of good familyand possess an education much above the common to be worthy of theplace.  I am the best-educated horse outside of the hippodrome,everybody says, and the best-mannered.  It may be so, it is not forme to say; modesty is the best policy, I think.  Buffalo Billtaught me the most of what I know, my mother taught me much, and Itaught myself the rest.  Lay a row of moccasins before me - Pawnee,Sioux, Shoshone, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and as many other tribes asyou please - and I can name the tribe every moccasin belongs to bythe make of it.  Name it in horse-talk, and could do it in Americanif I had speech.
I know some of the Indian signs - the signs they make with theirhands, and by signal-fires at night and columns of smoke by day.Buffalo Bill taught me how to drag wounded soldiers out of the lineof fire with my teeth; and I've done it, too; at least I've draggedHIM out of the battle when he was wounded.  And not just once, buttwice.  Yes, I know a lot of things.  I remember forms, and gaits,and faces; and you can't disguise a person that's done me akindness so that I won't know him thereafter wherever I find him.I know the art of searching for a trail, and I know the stale trackfrom the fresh.  I can keep a trail all by myself, with BuffaloBill asleep in the saddle; ask him - he will tell you so.  Many atime, when he has ridden all night, he has said to me at dawn,"Take the watch, Boy; if the trail freshens, call me."  Then hegoes to sleep.  He knows he can trust me, because I have areputation.  A scout horse that has a reputation does not play withit.
My mother was all American - no alkali-spider about HER, I can tellyou; she was of the best blood of Kentucky, the bluest Blue-grassaristocracy, very proud and acrimonious - or maybe it isceremonious.  I don't know which it is.  But it is no matter; sizeis the main thing about a word, and that one's up to standard.  Shespent her military life as colonel of the Tenth Dragoons, and saw adeal of rough service - distinguished service it was, too.  I mean,she CARRIED the Colonel; but it's all the same.  Where would he bewithout his horse?  He wouldn't arrive.  It takes two to make acolonel of dragoons.  She was a fine dragoon horse, but never gotabove that.  She was strong enough for the scout service, and hadthe endurance, too, but she couldn't quite come up to the speedrequired; a scout horse has to have steel in his muscle andlightning in his blood.
My father was a bronco.  Nothing as to lineage - that is, nothingas to recent lineage - but plenty good enough when you go a goodway back.  When Professor Marsh was out here hunting bones for thechapel of Yale University he found skeletons of horses no biggerthan a fox, bedded in the rocks, and he said they were ancestors ofmy father.  My mother heard him say it; and he said those skeletonswere two million years old, which astonished her and made herKentucky pretensions look small and pretty antiphonal, not to sayoblique.  Let me see. . . . I used to know the meaning of thosewords, but . . . well, it was years ago, and 'tisn't as vivid nowas it was when they were fresh.  That sort of words doesn't keep,in the kind of climate we have out here.  Professor Marsh saidthose skeletons were fossils.  So that makes me part blue grass andpart fossil; if there is any older or better stock, you will haveto look for it among the Four Hundred, I reckon.  I am satisfiedwith it.  And am a happy horse, too, though born out of wedlock.
And now we are back at Fort Paxton once more, after a forty-dayscout, away up as far as the Big Horn.  Everything quiet.  Crowsand Blackfeet squabbling - as usual - but no outbreaks, andsettlers feeling fairly easy.
The Seventh Cavalry still in garrison, here; also the NinthDragoons, two artillery companies, and some infantry.  All glad tosee me, including General Alison, commandant.  The officers' ladiesand children well, and called upon me - with sugar.  Colonel Drake,Seventh Cavalry, said some pleasant things; Mrs. Drake was verycomplimentary; also Captain and Mrs. Marsh, Company B, SeventhCavalry; also the Chaplain, who is always kind and pleasant to me,because I kicked the lungs out of a trader once.  It was TommyDrake and Fanny Marsh that furnished the sugar - nice children, thenicest at the post, I think.
That poor orphan child is on her way from France - everybody isfull of the subject.  Her father was General Alison's brother;married a beautiful young Spanish lady ten years ago, and has neverbeen in America since.  They lived in Spain a year or two, thenwent to France.  Both died some months ago.  This little girl thatis coming is the only child.  General Alison is glad to have her.He has never seen her.  He is a very nice old bachelor, but is anold bachelor just the same and isn't more than about a year thisside of retirement by age limit; and so what does he know abouttaking care of a little maid nine years old?  If I could have herit would be another matter, for I know all about children, and theyadore me.  Buffalo Bill will tell you so himself.
I have some of this news from over-hearing the garrison-gossip, therest of it I got from Potter, the General's dog.  Potter is thegreat Dane.  He is privileged, all over the post, like Shekels, theSeventh Cavalry's dog, and visits everybody's quarters and picks upeverything that is going, in the way of news.  Potter has noimagination, and no great deal of culture, perhaps, but he has ahistorical mind and a good memory, and so he is the person I dependupon mainly to post me up when I get back from a scout.  That is,if Shekels is out on depredation and I can't get hold of him.
