We visited all the holy places about Jerusalem which we had leftunvisited when we journeyed to the Jordan and then, about three o'clockone afternoon, we fell into procession and marched out at the statelyDamascus gate, and the walls of Jerusalem shut us out forever. We pausedon the summit of a distant hill and took a final look and made a finalfarewell to the venerable city which had been such a good home to us.
For about four hours we traveled down hill constantly. We followed anarrow bridle-path which traversed the beds of the mountain gorges, andwhen we could we got out of the way of the long trains of laden camelsand asses, and when we could not we suffered the misery of being mashedup against perpendicular walls of rock and having our legs bruised by thepassing freight. Jack was caught two or three times, and Dan and Moultas often. One horse had a heavy fall on the slippery rocks, and theothers had narrow escapes. However, this was as good a road as we hadfound in Palestine, and possibly even the best, and so there was not muchgrumbling.
Sometimes, in the glens, we came upon luxuriant orchards of figs,apricots, pomegranates, and such things, but oftener the scenery wasrugged, mountainous, verdureless and forbidding. Here and there, towerswere perched high up on acclivities which seemed almost inaccessible.This fashion is as old as Palestine itself and was adopted in ancienttimes for security against enemies.
We crossed the brook which furnished David the stone that killed Goliah,and no doubt we looked upon the very ground whereon that noted battle wasfought. We passed by a picturesque old gothic ruin whose stone pavementshad rung to the armed heels of many a valorous Crusader, and we rodethrough a piece of country which we were told once knew Samson as acitizen.
We staid all night with the good monks at the convent of Ramleh, and inthe morning got up and galloped the horses a good part of the distancefrom there to Jaffa, or Joppa, for the plain was as level as a floor andfree from stones, and besides this was our last march in Holy Land.These two or three hours finished, we and the tired horses could haverest and sleep as long as we wanted it. This was the plain of whichJoshua spoke when he said, "Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon, and thoumoon in the valley of Ajalon." As we drew near to Jaffa, the boysspurred up the horses and indulged in the excitement of an actual race--an experience we had hardly had since we raced on donkeys in the Azoresislands.
We came finally to the noble grove of orange-trees in which the Orientalcity of Jaffa lies buried; we passed through the walls, and rode againdown narrow streets and among swarms of animated rags, and saw othersights and had other experiences we had long been familiar with. Wedismounted, for the last time, and out in the offing, riding at anchor,we saw the ship! I put an exclamation point there because we felt onewhen we saw the vessel. The long pilgrimage was ended, and somehow weseemed to feel glad of it.
[For description of Jaffa, see Universal Gazetteer.] Simon the Tannerformerly lived here. We went to his house. All the pilgrims visit Simonthe Tanner's house. Peter saw the vision of the beasts let down in asheet when he lay upon the roof of Simon the Tanner's house. It was fromJaffa that Jonah sailed when he was told to go and prophesy againstNineveh, and no doubt it was not far from the town that the whale threwhim up when he discovered that he had no ticket. Jonah was disobedient,and of a fault-finding, complaining disposition, and deserves to belightly spoken of, almost. The timbers used in the construction ofSolomon's Temple were floated to Jaffa in rafts, and the narrow openingin the reef through which they passed to the shore is not an inch wideror a shade less dangerous to navigate than it was then. Such is thesleepy nature of the population Palestine's only good seaport has now andalways had. Jaffa has a history and a stirring one. It will not bediscovered any where in this book. If the reader will call at thecirculating library and mention my name, he will be furnished with bookswhich will afford him the fullest information concerning Jaffa.
So ends the pilgrimage. We ought to be glad that we did not make it forthe purpose of feasting our eyes upon fascinating aspects of nature, forwe should have been disappointed--at least at this season of the year. Awriter in "Life in the Holy Land" observes:
 "Monotonous and uninviting as much of the Holy Land will appear to persons accustomed to the almost constant verdure of flowers, ample streams and varied surface of our own country, we must remember that its aspect to the Israelites after the weary march of forty years through the desert must have been very different."
Which all of us will freely grant. But it truly is "monotonous anduninviting," and there is no sufficient reason for describing it as beingotherwise.
Of all the lands there are for dismal scenery, I think Palestine must bethe prince. The hills are barren, they are dull of color, they areunpicturesque in shape. The valleys are unsightly deserts fringed with afeeble vegetation that has an expression about it of being sorrowful anddespondent. The Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee sleep in the midst of avast stretch of hill and plain wherein the eye rests upon no pleasanttint, no striking object, no soft picture dreaming in a purple haze ormottled with the shadows of the clouds. Every outline is harsh, everyfeature is distinct, there is no perspective--distance works noenchantment here. It is a hopeless, dreary, heart-broken land.
Small shreds and patches of it must be very beautiful in the full flushof spring, however, and all the more beautiful by contrast with thefar-reaching desolation that surrounds them on every side. I would likemuch to see the fringes of the Jordan in spring-time, and Shechem,Esdraelon, Ajalon and the borders of Galilee--but even then these spotswould seem mere toy gardens set at wide intervals in the waste of alimitless desolation.
Palestine sits in sackcloth and ashes. Over it broods the spell of acurse that has withered its fields and fettered its energies. WhereSodom and Gomorrah reared their domes and towers, that solemn sea nowfloods the plain, in whose bitter waters no living thing exists--overwhose waveless surface the blistering air hangs motionless and dead--about whose borders nothing grows but weeds, and scattering tufts ofcane, and that treacherous fruit that promises refreshment to parchinglips, but turns to ashes at the touch. Nazareth is forlorn; about thatford of Jordan where the hosts of Israel entered the Promised Land withsongs of rejoicing, one finds only a squalid camp of fantastic Bedouinsof the desert; Jericho the accursed, lies a moldering ruin, to-day, evenas Joshua's miracle left it more than three thousand years ago; Bethlehemand Bethany, in their poverty and their humiliation, have nothing aboutthem now to remind one that they once knew the high honor of theSaviour's presence; the hallowed spot where the shepherds watched theirflocks by night, and where the angels sang Peace on earth, good will tomen, is untenanted by any living creature, and unblessed by any featurethat is pleasant to the eye. Renowned Jerusalem itself, the stateliestname in history, has lost all its ancient grandeur, and is become apauper village; the riches of Solomon are no longer there to compel theadmiration of visiting Oriental queens; the wonderful temple which wasthe pride and the glory of Israel, is gone, and the Ottoman crescent islifted above the spot where, on that most memorable day in the annals ofthe world, they reared the Holy Cross. The noted Sea of Galilee, whereRoman fleets once rode at anchor and the disciples of the Saviour sailedin their ships, was long ago deserted by the devotees of war andcommerce, and its borders are a silent wilderness; Capernaum is ashapeless ruin; Magdala is the home of beggared Arabs; Bethsaida andChorazin have vanished from the earth, and the "desert places" roundabout them where thousands of men once listened to the Saviour's voiceand ate the miraculous bread, sleep in the hush of a solitude that isinhabited only by birds of prey and skulking foxes.
Palestine is desolate and unlovely. And why should it be otherwise? Canthe curse of the Deity beautify a land?
Palestine is no more of this work-day world. It is sacred to poetry andtradition--it is dream-land.
