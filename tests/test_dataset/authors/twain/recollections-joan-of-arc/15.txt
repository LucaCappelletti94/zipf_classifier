Our Paladin in His Glory
WE WERE doomed to suffer tedious waits and delays, and we settledourselves down to our fate and bore it with a dreary patience, countingthe slow hours and the dull days and hoping for a turn when God shouldplease to send it. The Paladin was the only exception--that is to say, hewas the only one who was happy and had no heavy times. This was partlyowing to the satisfaction he got out of his clothes. He bought them atsecond hand--a Spanish cavalier's complete suit, wide-brimmed hat withflowing plumes, lace collar and cuffs, faded velvet doublet and trunks,short cloak hung from the shoulder, funnel-topped buskins, long rapier,and all that--a graceful and picturesque costume, and the Paladin's greatframe was the right place to hang it for effect. He wore it when offduty; and when he swaggered by with one hand resting on the hilt of hisrapier, and twirling his new mustache with the other, everybody stoppedto look and admire; and well they might, for he was a fine and statelycontrast to the small French gentlemen of the day squeezed into thetrivial French costume of the time.
He was king bee of the little village that snuggled under the shelter ofthe frowning towers and bastions of Courdray Castle, and acknowledgedlord of the tap-room of the inn. When he opened his mouth there, he got ahearing. Those simple artisans and peasants listened with deep andwondering interest; for he was a traveler and had seen the world--all ofit that lay between Chinon and Domremy, at any rate--and that was a widestretch more of it than they might ever hope to see; and he had been inbattle, and knew how to paint its shock and struggle, its perils andsurprised, with an art that was all his own. He was cock of that walk,hero of that hostelry; he drew custom as honey draws flies; so he was thepet of the innkeeper, and of his wife and daughter, and they were hisobliged and willing servants.
Most people who have the narrative gift--that great and rareendowment--have with it the defect of telling their choice things overthe same way every time, and this injures them and causes them to soundstale and wearisome after several repetitions; but it was not so with thePaladin, whose art was of a finer sort; it was more stirring andinteresting to hear him tell about a battle the tenth time than it wasthe first time, because he did not tell it twice the same way, but alwaysmade a new battle of it and a better one, with more casualties on theenemy's side each time, and more general wreck and disaster all around,and more widows and orphans and suffering in the neighborhood where ithappened. He could not tell his battles apart himself, except by theirnames; and by the time he had told one of then ten times it had grown sothat there wasn't room enough in France for it any more, but was lappingover the edges. But up to that point the audience would not allow him tosubstitute a new battle, knowing that the old ones were the best, andsure to improve as long as France could hold them; and so, instead ofsaying to him as they would have said to another, "Give us somethingfresh, we are fatigued with that old thing," they would say, with onevoice and with a strong interest, "Tell about the surprise at Beaulieuagain--tell in three or four times!" That is a compliment which fewnarrative experts have heard in their lifetime.
At first when the Paladin heard us tell about the glories of the RoyalAudience he was broken-hearted because he was not taken with us to it;next, his talk was full of what he would have done if he had been there;and within two days he was telling what he did do when he was there. Hismill was fairly started, now, and could be trusted to take care of itsaffair. Within three nights afterward all his battles were taking a rest,for already his worshipers in the tap-room were so infatuated with thegreat tale of the Royal Audience that they would have nothing else, andso besotted with it were they that they would have cried if they couldnot have gotten it.
Noel Rainguesson hid himself and heard it, and came and told me, andafter that we went together to listen, bribing the inn hostess to let ushave her little private parlor, where we could stand at the wickets inthe door and see and hear.
The tap-room was large, yet had a snug and cozy look, with its invitinglittle tables and chairs scattered irregularly over its red brick floor,and its great fire flaming and crackling in the wide chimney. It was acomfortable place to be in on such chilly and blustering March nights asthese, and a goodly company had taken shelter there, and were sippingtheir wine in contentment and gossiping one with another in a neighborlyway while they waited for the historian. The host, the hostess, and theirpretty daughter were flying here and there and yonder among the tablesand doing their best to keep up with the orders. The room was about fortyfeet square, and a space or aisle down the center of it had been keptvacant and reserved for the Paladin's needs. At the end of it was aplatform ten or twelve feet wide, with a big chair and a small table onit, and three steps leading up to it.
Among the wine-sippers were many familiar faces: the cobbler, thefarrier, the blacksmith, the wheelwright, the armorer, the maltster, theweaver, the backer, the miller's man with his dusty coat, and so on; andconscious and important, as a matter of course, was the barber-surgeon,for he is that in all villages. As he has to pull everybody's teeth andpurge and bleed all the grown people once a month to keep their healthsound, he knows everybody, and by constant contact with all sorts of folkbecomes a master of etiquette and manners and a conversationalist oflarge facility. There were plenty of carriers, drovers, and their sort,and journeymen artisans.
When the Paladin presently came sauntering indolently in, he was receivedwith a cheer, and the barber hustled forward and greeted him with severallow and most graceful and courtly bows, also taking his hand an touchinghis lips to it. Then he called in a loud voice for a stoup of wine forthe Paladin, and when the host's daughter brought it up on the platformand dropped her courtesy and departed, the barber called after her, andtold her to add the wine to his score. This won him ejaculations ofapproval, which pleased him very much and made his little rat-eyes shine;and such applause is right and proper, for when we do a liberal andgallant thing it is but natural that we should wish to see notice takenof it.
The barber called upon the people to rise and drink the Paladin's health,and they did it with alacrity and affectionate heartiness, clashing theirmetal flagons together with a simultaneous crash, and heightening theeffect with a resounding cheer. It was a fine thing to see how that youngswashbuckler had made himself so popular in a strange land in so little awhile, and without other helps to his advancement than just his tongueand the talent to use it given him by God--a talent which was but onetalent in the beginning, but was now become ten through husbandry and theincrement and usufruct that do naturally follow that and reward it as bya law.
The people sat down and began to hammer on the tables with their flagonsand call for "the King's Audience!--the King's Audience! --the King'sAudience!" The Paladin stood there in one of his best attitudes, with hisplumed great hat tipped over to the left, the folds of his short cloakdrooping from his shoulder, and the one hand resting upon the hilt of hisrapier and the other lifting his beaker. As the noise died down he made astately sort of a bow, which he had picked up somewhere, then fetched hisbeaker with a sweep to his lips and tilted his head back and rained it tothe bottom. The barber jumped for it and set it upon the Paladin's table.Then the Paladin began to walk up and down his platform with a great dealof dignity and quite at his ease; and as he walked he talked, and everylittle while stopped and stood facing his house and so standing continuedhis talk.
We went three nights in succession. It was plain that there was a charmabout the performance that was apart from the mere interest whichattaches to lying. It was presently discoverable that this charm lay inthe Paladin's sincerity. He was not lying consciously; he believed whathe was saying. To him, his initial statements were facts, and whenever heenlarged a statement, the enlargement became a fact too. He put his heartinto his extravagant narrative, just as a poet puts his heart into aheroic fiction, and his earnestness disarmed criticism--disarmed it asfar as he himself was concerned. Nobody believed his narrative, but allbelieved that he believed it.
He made his enlargements without flourish, without emphasis, and socasually that often one failed to notice that a change had been made. Hespoke of the governor of Vaucouleurs, the first night, simply as thegovernor of Vaucouleurs; he spoke of him the second night as his unclethe governor of Vaucouleurs; the third night he was his father. He didnot seem to know that he was making these extraordinary changes; theydropped from his lips in a quite natural and effortless way. By his firstnight's account the governor merely attached him to the Maid's militaryescort in a general and unofficial way; the second night his uncle thegovernor sent him with the Maid as lieutenant of her rear guard; thethird night his father the governor put the whole command, Maid and all,in his special charge. The first night the governor spoke of his as ayouth without name or ancestry, but "destined to achieve both"; thesecond night his uncle the governor spoke of him as the latest andworthiest lineal descendent of the chiefest and noblest of the TwelvePaladins of Charlemagne; the third night he spoke of his as the linealdescendent of the whole dozen. In three nights he promoted the Count ofVendome from a fresh acquaintance to a schoolmate, and thenbrother-in-law.
At the King's Audience everything grew, in the same way. First the foursilver trumpets were twelve, then thirty-five, finally ninety-six; and bythat time he had thrown in so many drums and cymbals that he had tolengthen the hall from five hundred feet to nine hundred to accommodatethem. Under his hand the people present multiplied in the same large way.
The first two nights he contented himself with merely describing andexaggerating the chief dramatic incident of the Audience, but the thirdnight he added illustration to description. He throned the barber in hisown high chair to represent the sham King; then he told how the Courtwatched the Maid with intense interest and suppressed merriment,expecting to see her fooled by the deception and get herself sweptpermanently out of credit by the storm of scornful laughter which wouldfollow. He worked this scene up till he got his house in a burning feverof excitement and anticipation, then came his climax. Turning to thebarber, he said:
"But mark you what she did. She gazed steadfastly upon that sham'svillain face as I now gaze upon yours--this being her noble and simpleattitude, just as I stand now--then turned she--thus--to me, andstretching her arm out--so--and pointing with her finger, she said, inthat firm, calm tone which she was used to use in directing the conductof a battle, 'Pluck me this false knave from the throne!' I, stridingforward as I do now, took him by the collar and lifted him out and heldhim aloft--thus--as it he had been but a child." (The house rose,shouting, stamping, and banging with their flagons, and went fairly madover this magnificent exhibition of strength--and there was not theshadow of a laugh anywhere, though the spectacle of the limp but proudbarber hanging there in the air like a puppy held by the scruff of itsneck was a thing that had nothing of solemnity about it.) "Then I set himdown upon his feet--thus--being minded to get him by a better hold andheave him out of the window, but she bid me forbear, so by that error heescaped with his life.
"Then she turned her about and viewed the throng with those eyes of hers,which are the clear-shining windows whence her immortal wisdom lookethout upon the world, resolving its falsities and coming at the kernel oftruth that is hid within them, and presently they fell upon a young manmodestly clothed, and him she proclaimed for what he truly was, saying,'I am thy servant--thou art the King!' Then all were astonished, and agreat shout went up, the whole six thousand joining in it, so that thewalls rocked with the volume and the tumult of it."
He made a fine and picturesque thing of the march-out from the Audience,augmenting the glories of it to the last limit of the impossibilities;then he took from his finger and held up a brass nut from a bolt-headwhich the head ostler at the castle had given him that morning, and madehis conclusion--thus:
"Then the King dismissed the Maid most graciously--as indeed was herdesert--and, turning to me, said, 'Take this signet-ring, son of thePaladins, and command me with it in your day of need; and look you,' saidhe, touching my temple, 'preserve this brain, France has use for it; andlook well to its casket also, for I foresee that it will be hooped with aducal coronet one day.' I took the ring, and knelt and kissed his hand,saying, 'Sire, where glory calls, there will I be found; where danger anddeath are thickest, that is my native air; when France and the throneneed help--well, I say nothing, for I am not of the talking sort--let mydeeds speak for me, it is all I ask.'
"So ended the most fortunate and memorable episode, so big with futureweal for the crown and the nation, and unto God be the thanks! Rise! Fillyou flagons! Now--to France and the King--drink!"
They emptied them to the bottom, then burst into cheers and huzzas, andkept it up as much as two minutes, the Paladin standing at stately easethe while and smiling benignantly from his platform.
