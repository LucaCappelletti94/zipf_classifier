I done it. She looked me all over with her littleshiny eyes, and says:
"What might your name be?"
"Sarah Williams."
"Where 'bouts do you live? In this neighbor-hood?'
"No'm. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I'vewalked all the way and I'm all tired out."
"Hungry, too, I reckon. I'll find you something."
"No'm, I ain't hungry. I was so hungry I had tostop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain't hungryno more. It's what makes me so late. My mother'sdown sick, and out of money and everything, and Icome to tell my uncle Abner Moore. He lives at theupper end of the town, she says. I hain't ever beenhere before. Do you know him?"
"No; but I don't know everybody yet. I haven'tlived here quite two weeks. It's a considerable waysto the upper end of the town. You better stay hereall night. Take off your bonnet."
"No," I says; "I'll rest a while, I reckon, and goon. I ain't afeared of the dark."
She said she wouldn't let me go by myself, but herhusband would be in by and by, maybe in a hour anda half, and she'd send him along with me. Then shegot to talking about her husband, and about her rela-tions up the river, and her relations down the river,and about how much better off they used to was, andhow they didn't know but they'd made a mistakecoming to our town, instead of letting well alone --and so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made amistake coming to her to find out what was going onin the town; but by and by she dropped on to papand the murder, and then I was pretty willing to lether clatter right along. She told about me and TomSawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only she gotit ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was,and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down towhere I was murdered. I says:
"Who done it? We've heard considerable aboutthese goings on down in Hookerville, but we don'tknow who 'twas that killed Huck Finn."
"Well, I reckon there's a right smart chance ofpeople HERE that'd like to know who killed him. Somethink old Finn done it himself."
"No -- is that so?"
"Most everybody thought it at first. He'll neverknow how nigh he come to getting lynched. Butbefore night they changed around and judged it wasdone by a runaway nigger named Jim."
"Why HE --"
I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She runon, and never noticed I had put in at all:
"The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn waskilled. So there's a reward out for him -- three hun-dred dollars. And there's a reward out for old Finn,too -- two hundred dollars. You see, he come to townthe morning after the murder, and told about it, andwas out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt, and rightaway after he up and left. Before night they wantedto lynch him, but he was gone, you see. Well, nextday they found out the nigger was gone; they foundout he hadn't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night themurder was done. So then they put it on him, yousee; and while they was full of it, next day, backcomes old Finn, and went boo-hooing to JudgeThatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all overIllinois with. The judge gave him some, and thatevening he got drunk, and was around till after mid-night with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers,and then went off with them. Well, he hain't comeback sence, and they ain't looking for him back tillthis thing blows over a little, for people thinks nowthat he killed his boy and fixed things so folks wouldthink robbers done it, and then he'd get Huck's moneywithout having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.People do say he warn't any too good to do it. Oh,he's sly, I reckon. If he don't come back for a yearhe'll be all right. You can't prove anything on him,you know; everything will be quieted down then, andhe'll walk in Huck's money as easy as nothing."
"Yes, I reckon so, 'm. I don't see nothing in theway of it. Has everybody guit thinking the niggerdone it?"
"Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks hedone it. But they'll get the nigger pretty soon now,and maybe they can scare it out of him."
"Why, are they after him yet?"
"Well, you're innocent, ain't you! Does threehundred dollars lay around every day for people topick up? Some folks think the nigger ain't far fromhere. I'm one of them -- but I hain't talked it around.A few days ago I was talking with an old couple thatlives next door in the log shanty, and they happenedto say hardly anybody ever goes to that island overyonder that they call Jackson's Island. Don't any-body live there? says I. No, nobody, says they. Ididn't say any more, but I done some thinking. Iwas pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over there,about the head of the island, a day or two before that,so I says to myself, like as not that nigger's hidingover there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble togive the place a hunt. I hain't seen any smoke sence,so I reckon maybe he's gone, if it was him; buthusband's going over to see -- him and another man.He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day,and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago."
I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I had to dosomething with my hands; so I took up a needle off ofthe table and went to threading it. My hands shook,and I was making a bad job of it. When the womanstopped talking I looked up, and she was looking atme pretty curious and smiling a little. I put down theneedle and thread, and let on to be interested -- and Iwas, too -- and says:
"Three hundred dollars is a power of money. Iwish my mother could get it. Is your husband goingover there to-night?"
"Oh, yes. He went up-town with the man I wastelling you of, to get a boat and see if they couldborrow another gun. They'll go over after midnight."
"Couldn't they see better if they was to wait tilldaytime?"
"Yes. And couldn't the nigger see better, too?After midnight he'll likely be asleep, and they can sliparound through the woods and hunt up his camp fireall the better for the dark, if he's got one."
"I didn't think of that."
The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, andI didn't feel a bit comfortable. Pretty soon she says"
"What did you say your name was, honey?"
"M -- Mary Williams."
Somehow it didn't seem to me that I said it wasMary before, so I didn't look up -- seemed to me Isaid it was Sarah; so I felt sort of cornered, and wasafeared maybe I was looking it, too. I wished thewoman would say something more; the longer she setstill the uneasier I was. But now she says:
"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah whenyou first come in?"
"Oh, yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah'smy first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls meMary."
"Oh, that's the way of it?"
"Yes'm."
I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out ofthere, anyway. I couldn't look up yet.
Well, the woman fell to talking about how hardtimes was, and how poor they had to live, and how therats was as free as if they owned the place, and soforth and so on, and then I got easy again. She wasright about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose outof a hole in the corner every little while. She said shehad to have things handy to throw at them when shewas alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace. Sheshowed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, andsaid she was a good shot with it generly, but she'dwrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't knowwhether she could throw true now. But she watchedfor a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; butshe missed him wide, and said "Ouch!" it hurt herarm so. Then she told me to try for the next one. Iwanted to be getting away before the old man gotback, but of course I didn't let on. I got the thing,and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive, andif he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerablesick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckonedI would hive the next one. She went and got thelump of lead and fetched it back, and brought along ahank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with.I held up my two hands and she put the hank overthem, and went on talking about her and her husband'smatters. But she broke off to say:
"Keep your eye on the rats. You better have thelead in your lap, handy."
So she dropped the lump into my lap just at thatmoment, and I clapped my legs together on it and shewent on talking. But only about a minute. Thenshe took off the hank and looked me straight in theface, and very pleasant, and says:
"Come, now, what's your real name?"
"Wh -- what, mum?"
"What's your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, orBob? -- or what is it?"
I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn't knowhardly what to do. But I says:
"Please to don't poke fun at a poor girl like me,mum. If I'm in the way here, I'll --"
"No, you won't. Set down and stay where youare. I ain't going to hurt you, and I ain't going totell on you, nuther. You just tell me your secret, andtrust me. I'll keep it; and, what's more, I'll helpyou. So'll my old man if you want him to. Yousee, you're a runaway 'prentice, that's all. It ain'tanything. There ain't no harm in it. You've beentreated bad, and you made up your mind to cut.Bless you, child, I wouldn't tell on you. Tell me allabout it now, that's a good boy."
So I said it wouldn't be no use to try to play it anylonger, and I would just make a clean breast and tellher everything, but she musn't go back on her promise.Then I told her my father and mother was dead, andthe law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in thecountry thirty mile back from the river, and he treatedme so bad I couldn't stand it no longer; he went awayto be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chanceand stole some of his daughter's old clothes andcleared out, and I had been three nights coming thethirty miles. I traveled nights, and hid daytimes andslept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried fromhome lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. Isaid I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take careof me, and so that was why I struck out for this townof Goshen.
"Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St.Petersburg. Goshen's ten mile further up the river.Who told you this was Goshen?"
"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, justas I was going to turn into the woods for my regularsleep. He told me when the roads forked I must takethe right hand, and five mile would fetch me toGoshen."
"He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just ex-actly wrong."
"Well,,he did act like he was drunk, but it ain't nomatter now. I got to be moving along. I'll fetchGoshen before daylight."
"Hold on a minute. I'll put you up a snack to eat.You might want it."
So she put me up a snack, and says:
"Say, when a cow's laying down, which end of hergets up first? Answer up prompt now -- don't stopto study over it. Which end gets up first?"
"The hind end, mum."
"Well, then, a horse?"
"The for'rard end, mum."
"Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?"
"North side."
"If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, howmany of them eats with their heads pointed the samedirection?"
"The whole fifteen, mum."
"Well, I reckon you HAVE lived in the country. Ithought maybe you was trying to hocus me again.What's your real name, now?"
"George Peters, mum."
"Well, try to remember it, George. Don't forgetand tell me it's Elexander before you go, and then getout by saying it's George Elexander when I catch you.And don't go about women in that old calico. Youdo a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool men,maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to threada needle don't hold the thread still and fetch the needleup to it; hold the needle still and poke the thread atit; that's the way a woman most always does, but aman always does t'other way. And when you throwat a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe andfetch your hand up over your head as awkward as youcan, and miss your rat about six or seven foot. Throwstiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivotthere for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wristand elbow, with your arm out to one side, like a boy.And, mind you, when a girl tries to catch anything inher lap she throws her knees apart; she don't clapthem together, the way you did when you catched thelump of lead. Why, I spotted you for a boy whenyou was threading the needle; and I contrived theother things just to make certain. Now trot along toyour uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George ElexanderPeters, and if you get into trouble you send word toMrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I'll do what Ican to get you out of it. Keep the river road all theway, and next time you tramp take shoes and sockswith you. The river road's a rocky one, and yourfeet'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen, Ireckon."
I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then Idoubled on my tracks and slipped back to where mycanoe was, a good piece below the house. I jumpedin, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream farenough to make the head of the island, and thenstarted across. I took off the sun-bonnet, for I didn'twant no blinders on then. When I was about themiddle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stopsand listens; the sound come faint over the water butclear -- eleven. When I struck the head of the islandI never waited to blow, though I was most winded, butI shoved right into the timber where my old camp usedto be, and started a good fire there on a high and dryspot.
Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for ourplace, a mile and a half below, as hard as I could go.I landed, and slopped through the timber and up theridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, soundasleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:
"Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain't aminute to lose. They're after us!"
Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word;but the way he worked for the next half an hourshowed about how he was scared. By that time every-thing we had in the world was on our raft, and she wasready to be shoved out from the willow cove where shewas hid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern thefirst thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.
I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece,and took a look; but if there was a boat around Icouldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't good to seeby. Then we got out the raft and slipped along downin the shade, past the foot of the island dead still --never saying a word.
