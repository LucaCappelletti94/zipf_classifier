I reached the Alps: the soul within me burned,Italia, my Italia, at thy name:And when from out the mountain's heart I cameAnd saw the land for which my life had yearned,I laughed as one who some great prize had earned:And musing on the marvel of thy fameI watched the day, till marked with wounds of flameThe turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.The pine-trees waved as waves a woman's hair,And in the orchards every twining sprayWas breaking into flakes of blossoming foam:But when I knew that far away at RomeIn evil bonds a second Peter lay,I wept to see the land so very fair.
TURIN.
