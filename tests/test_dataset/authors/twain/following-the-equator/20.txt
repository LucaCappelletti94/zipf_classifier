It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those threeunspeakably precious things: freedom of speech, freedom of conscience,and the prudence never to practice either of them. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
From diary:
Mr. G. called. I had not seen him since Nauheim, Germany--several yearsago; the time that the cholera broke out at Hamburg. We talked of thepeople we had known there, or had casually met; and G. said:
"Do you remember my introducing you to an earl--the Earl of C.?"
"Yes. That was the last time I saw you. You and he were in a carriage,just starting--belated--for the train. I remember it."
"I remember it too, because of a thing which happened then which I wasnot looking for. He had told me a while before, about a remarkable andinteresting Californian whom he had met and who was a friend of yours,and said that if he should ever meet you he would ask you for someparticulars about that Californian. The subject was not mentioned thatday at Nauheim, for we were hurrying away, and there was no time; but thething that surprised me was this: when I induced you, you said, 'I amglad to meet your lordship gain.' The I again' was the surprise. He isa little hard of hearing, and didn't catch that word, and I thought youhadn't intended that he should. As we drove off I had only time to say,'Why, what do you know about him?' and I understood you to say, 'Oh,nothing, except that he is the quickest judge of----' Then we were gone,and I didn't get the rest. I wondered what it was that he was such aquick judge of. I have thought of it many times since, and stillwondered what it could be. He and I talked it over, but could not guessit out. He thought it must be fox-hounds or horses, for he is a goodjudge of those--no one is a better. But you couldn't know that, becauseyou didn't know him; you had mistaken him for some one else; it must bethat, he said, because he knew you had never met him before. And ofcourse you hadn't had you?"
"Yes, I had."
"Is that so? Where?"
"At a fox-hunt, in England."
"How curious that is. Why, he hadn't the least recollection of it. Hadyou any conversation with him?"
"Some--yes."
"Well, it left not the least impression upon him. What did you talkabout?"
"About the fox. I think that was all."
"Why, that would interest him; that ought to have left an impression.What did he talk about?"
"The fox."
It's very curious. I don't understand it. Did what he said leave animpression upon you?"
"Yes. It showed me that he was a quick judge of--however, I will tellyou all about it, then you will understand. It was a quarter of acentury ago 1873 or '74. I had an American friend in London named F.,who was fond of hunting, and his friends the Blanks invited him and me tocome out to a hunt and be their guests at their country place. In themorning the mounts were provided, but when I saw the horses I changed mymind and asked permission to walk. I had never seen an English hunterbefore, and it seemed to me that I could hunt a fox safer on the ground.I had always been diffident about horses, anyway, even those of thecommon altitudes, and I did not feel competent to hunt on a horse thatwent on stilts. So then Mrs. Blank came to my help and said I could gowith her in the dog-cart and we would drive to a place she knew of, andthere we should have a good glimpse of the hunt as it went by.
"When we got to that place I got out and went and leaned my elbows on alow stone wall which enclosed a turfy and beautiful great field withheavy wood on all its sides except ours. Mrs. Blank sat in the dog-cartfifty yards away, which was as near as she could get with the vehicle.I was full of interest, for I had never seen a fox-hunt. I waited,dreaming and imagining, in the deep stillness and impressive tranquilitywhich reigned in that retired spot. Presently, from away off in theforest on the left, a mellow bugle-note came floating; then all of asudden a multitude of dogs burst out of that forest and went tearing byand disappeared in the forest on the right; there was a pause, and thena cloud of horsemen in black caps and crimson coats plunged out of theleft-hand forest and went flaming across the field like a prairie-fire,a stirring sight to see. There was one man ahead of the rest, and hecame spurring straight at me. He was fiercely excited. It was fine tosee him ride; he was a master horseman. He came like, a storm till hewas within seven feet of me, where I was leaning on the wall, then hestood his horse straight up in the air on his hind toe-nails, and shoutedlike a demon:
"'Which way'd the fox go?'
"I didn't much like the tone, but I did not let on; for he was excited,you know. But I was calm; so I said softly, and without acrimony:
"'Which fox?'
"It seemed to anger him. I don't know why; and he thundered out:
"'WHICH fox? Why, THE fox? Which way did the FOX go?'
"I said, with great gentleness--even argumentatively:
"'If you could be a little more definite--a little less vague--because Iam a stranger, and there are many foxes, as you will know even betterthan I, and unless I know which one it is that you desire to identify,and----'
"'You're certainly the damdest idiot that has escaped in a thousandyears!' and he snatched his great horse around as easily as I wouldsnatch a cat, and was away like a hurricane. A very excitable man.
"I went back to Mrs. Blank, and she was excited, too--oh, all alive. Shesaid:
"'He spoke to you!--didn't he?'
"'Yes, it is what happened.'
"'I knew it! I couldn't hear what he said, but I knew he spoke to you! Doyou know who it was? It was Lord C., and he is Master of the Buckhounds!Tell me--what do you think of him?'
"'Him? Well, for sizing-up a stranger, he's got the most sudden andaccurate judgment of any man I ever saw.'
"It pleased her. I thought it would."
G. got away from Nauheim just in time to escape being shut in by thequarantine-bars on the frontiers; and so did we, for we left the nextday. But G. had a great deal of trouble in getting by the Italiancustom-house, and we should have fared likewise but for thethoughtfulness of our consul-general in Frankfort. He introduced me tothe Italian consul-general, and I brought away from that consulate aletter which made our way smooth. It was a dozen lines merely commendingme in a general way to the courtesies of servants in his ItalianMajesty's service, but it was more powerful than it looked. In additionto a raft of ordinary baggage, we had six or eight trunks which werefilled exclusively with dutiable stuff--household goods purchased inFrankfort for use in Florence, where we had taken a house. I was goingto ship these through by express; but at the last moment an order wentthroughout Germany forbidding the moving of any parcels by train unlessthe owner went with them. This was a bad outlook. We must take thesethings along, and the delay sure to be caused by the examination of themin the custom-house might lose us our train. I imagined all sorts ofterrors, and enlarged them steadily as we approached the Italianfrontier. We were six in number, clogged with all that baggage, and Iwas courier for the party the most incapable one they ever employed.
We arrived, and pressed with the crowd into the immense custom-house, andthe usual worries began; everybody crowding to the counter and begging tohave his baggage examined first, and all hands clattering and chatteringat once. It seemed to me that I could do nothing; it would be better togive it all up and go away and leave the baggage. I couldn't speak thelanguage; I should never accomplish anything. Just then a tall handsomeman in a fine uniform was passing by and I knew he must be thestation-master--and that reminded me of my letter. I ran to him and putit into his hands. He took it out of the envelope, and the moment hiseye caught the royal coat of arms printed at its top, he took off his capand made a beautiful bow to me, and said in English:
"Which is your baggage? Please show it to me."
I showed him the mountain. Nobody was disturbing it; nobody wasinterested in it; all the family's attempts to get attention to it hadfailed--except in the case of one of the trunks containing the dutiablegoods. It was just being opened. My officer said:
"There, let that alone! Lock it. Now chalk it. Chalk all of the lot.Now please come and show the hand-baggage."
He plowed through the waiting crowd, I following, to the counter, and hegave orders again, in his emphatic military way:
"Chalk these. Chalk all of them."
Then he took off his cap and made that beautiful bow again, and went hisway. By this time these attentions had attracted the wonder of that acreof passengers, and the whisper had gone around that the royal family werepresent getting their baggage chalked; and as we passed down in review onour way to the door, I was conscious of a pervading atmosphere of envywhich gave me deep satisfaction.
But soon there was an accident. My overcoat pockets were stuffed withGerman cigars and linen packages of American smoking tobacco, and aporter was following us around with this overcoat on his arm, andgradually getting it upside down. Just as I, in the rear of my family,moved by the sentinels at the door, about three hatfuls of the tobaccotumbled out on the floor. One of the soldiers pounced upon it, gatheredit up in his arms, pointed back whence I had come, and marched me aheadof him past that long wall of passengers again--he chattering andexulting like a devil, they smiling in peaceful joy, and I trying to lookas if my pride was not hurt, and as if I did not mind being brought toshame before these pleased people who had so lately envied me. But atheart I was cruelly humbled.
When I had been marched two-thirds of the long distance and the misery ofit was at the worst, the stately station-master stepped out fromsomewhere, and the soldier left me and darted after him and overtook him;and I could see by the soldier's excited gestures that he was betrayingto him the whole shabby business. The station-master was plainly veryangry. He came striding down toward me, and when he was come near hebegan to pour out a stream of indignant Italian; then suddenly took offhis hat and made that beautiful bow and said:
"Oh, it is you! I beg a thousands pardons! This idiot here---" He turnedto the exulting soldier and burst out with a flood of white-hot Italianlava, and the next moment he was bowing, and the soldier and I weremoving in procession again--he in the lead and ashamed, this time, I withmy chin up. And so we marched by the crowd of fascinated passengers, andI went forth to the train with the honors of war. Tobacco and all.
