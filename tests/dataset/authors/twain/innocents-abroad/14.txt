We went to see the Cathedral of Notre Dame. We had heard of it before.It surprises me sometimes to think how much we do know and howintelligent we are. We recognized the brown old Gothic pile in a moment;it was like the pictures. We stood at a little distance and changed fromone point of observation to another and gazed long at its lofty squaretowers and its rich front, clustered thick with stony, mutilated saintswho had been looking calmly down from their perches for ages. ThePatriarch of Jerusalem stood under them in the old days of chivalry andromance, and preached the third Crusade, more than six hundred years ago;and since that day they have stood there and looked quietly down upon themost thrilling scenes, the grandest pageants, the most extraordinaryspectacles that have grieved or delighted Paris. These battered andbroken-nosed old fellows saw many and many a cavalcade of mail-cladknights come marching home from Holy Land; they heard the bells abovethem toll the signal for the St. Bartholomew's Massacre, and they saw theslaughter that followed; later they saw the Reign of Terror, the carnageof the Revolution, the overthrow of a king, the coronation of twoNapoleons, the christening of the young prince that lords it over aregiment of servants in the Tuileries to-day--and they may possiblycontinue to stand there until they see the Napoleon dynasty swept awayand the banners of a great republic floating above its ruins. I wishthese old parties could speak. They could tell a tale worth thelistening to.
They say that a pagan temple stood where Notre Dame now stands, in theold Roman days, eighteen or twenty centuries ago--remains of it are stillpreserved in Paris; and that a Christian church took its place about A.D.300; another took the place of that in A.D. 500; and that the foundationsof the present cathedral were laid about A.D. 1100. The ground ought tobe measurably sacred by this time, one would think. One portion of thisnoble old edifice is suggestive of the quaint fashions of ancient times.It was built by Jean Sans-Peur, Duke of Burgundy, to set his conscienceat rest--he had assassinated the Duke of Orleans. Alas! Those good oldtimes are gone when a murderer could wipe the stain from his name andsoothe his troubles to sleep simply by getting out his bricks and mortarand building an addition to a church.
The portals of the great western front are bisected by square pillars.They took the central one away in 1852, on the occasion of thanksgivingsfor the reinstitution of the presidential power--but precious soon theyhad occasion to reconsider that motion and put it back again! And theydid.
We loitered through the grand aisles for an hour or two, staring up atthe rich stained-glass windows embellished with blue and yellow andcrimson saints and martyrs, and trying to admire the numberless greatpictures in the chapels, and then we were admitted to the sacristy andshown the magnificent robes which the Pope wore when he crowned NapoleonI; a wagon-load of solid gold and silver utensils used in the greatpublic processions and ceremonies of the church; some nails of the truecross, a fragment of the cross itself, a part of the crown of thorns.We had already seen a large piece of the true cross in a church in theAzores, but no nails. They showed us likewise the bloody robe which thatarchbishop of Paris wore who exposed his sacred person and braved thewrath of the insurgents of 1848, to mount the barricades and hold aloftthe olive branch of peace in the hope of stopping the slaughter. Hisnoble effort cost him his life. He was shot dead. They showed us a castof his face taken after death, the bullet that killed him, and the twovertebrae in which it lodged. These people have a somewhat singulartaste in the matter of relics. Ferguson told us that the silver crosswhich the good archbishop wore at his girdle was seized and thrown intothe Seine, where it lay embedded in the mud for fifteen years, and thenan angel appeared to a priest and told him where to dive for it; he diddive for it and got it, and now it is there on exhibition at Notre Dame,to be inspected by anybody who feels an interest in inanimate objects ofmiraculous intervention.
Next we went to visit the Morgue, that horrible receptacle for the deadwho die mysteriously and leave the manner of their taking off a dismalsecret. We stood before a grating and looked through into a room whichwas hung all about with the clothing of dead men; coarse blouses,water-soaked; the delicate garments of women and children; patricianvestments, hacked and stabbed and stained with red; a hat that wascrushed and bloody. On a slanting stone lay a drowned man, naked,swollen, purple; clasping the fragment of a broken bush with a gripwhich death had so petrified that human strength could not unloose it--mute witness of the last despairing effort to save the life that wasdoomed beyond all help. A stream of water trickled ceaselessly over thehideous face. We knew that the body and the clothing were there foridentification by friends, but still we wondered if anybody could lovethat repulsive object or grieve for its loss. We grew meditative andwondered if, some forty years ago, when the mother of that ghastly thingwas dandling it upon her knee, and kissing it and petting it anddisplaying it with satisfied pride to the passers-by, a prophetic visionof this dread ending ever flitted through her brain. I half feared thatthe mother, or the wife or a brother of the dead man might come while westood there, but nothing of the kind occurred. Men and women came, andsome looked eagerly in and pressed their faces against the bars; othersglanced carelessly at the body and turned away with a disappointed look--people, I thought, who live upon strong excitements and who attend theexhibitions of the Morgue regularly, just as other people go to seetheatrical spectacles every night. When one of these looked in andpassed on, I could not help thinking--
"Now this don't afford you any satisfaction--a party with his head shotoff is what you need."
One night we went to the celebrated Jardin Mabille, but only staid alittle while. We wanted to see some of this kind of Paris life, however,and therefore the next night we went to a similar place of entertainmentin a great garden in the suburb of Asnieres. We went to the railroaddepot, toward evening, and Ferguson got tickets for a second-classcarriage. Such a perfect jam of people I have not often seen--but therewas no noise, no disorder, no rowdyism. Some of the women and younggirls that entered the train we knew to be of the demi-monde, but otherswe were not at all sure about.
The girls and women in our carriage behaved themselves modestly andbecomingly all the way out, except that they smoked. When we arrived atthe garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered aplace which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curvingrows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bowerconvenient for eating ice cream in. We moved along the sinuous gravelwalks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly adomed and filigreed white temple, starred over and over and over againwith brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun. Nearby was alarge, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way,and above its roof floated the Star-Spangled Banner of America.
"Well!" I said. "How is this?" It nearly took my breath away.
Ferguson said an American--a New Yorker--kept the place, and was carryingon quite a stirring opposition to the Jardin Mabille.
Crowds composed of both sexes and nearly all ages were frisking about thegarden or sitting in the open air in front of the flagstaff and thetemple, drinking wine and coffee or smoking. The dancing had not begunyet. Ferguson said there was to be an exhibition. The famous Blondinwas going to perform on a tightrope in another part of the garden. Wewent thither. Here the light was dim, and the masses of people werepretty closely packed together. And now I made a mistake which anydonkey might make, but a sensible man never. I committed an error whichI find myself repeating every day of my life. Standing right before ayoung lady, I said:
"Dan, just look at this girl, how beautiful she is!"
"I thank you more for the evident sincerity of the compliment, sir, thanfor the extraordinary publicity you have given to it!" This in good,pure English.
We took a walk, but my spirits were very, very sadly dampened. I did notfeel right comfortable for some time afterward. Why will people be sostupid as to suppose themselves the only foreigners among a crowd of tenthousand persons?
But Blondin came out shortly. He appeared on a stretched cable, far awayabove the sea of tossing hats and handkerchiefs, and in the glare of thehundreds of rockets that whizzed heavenward by him he looked like a weeinsect. He balanced his pole and walked the length of his rope--two orthree hundred feet; he came back and got a man and carried him across; hereturned to the center and danced a jig; next he performed some gymnasticand balancing feats too perilous to afford a pleasant spectacle; and hefinished by fastening to his person a thousand Roman candles, Catherinewheels, serpents and rockets of all manner of brilliant colors, settingthem on fire all at once and walking and waltzing across his rope againin a blinding blaze of glory that lit up the garden and the people'sfaces like a great conflagration at midnight.
The dance had begun, and we adjourned to the temple. Within it was adrinking saloon, and all around it was a broad circular platform for thedancers. I backed up against the wall of the temple, and waited. Twentysets formed, the music struck up, and then--I placed my hands before myface for very shame. But I looked through my fingers. They were dancingthe renowned "Can-can." A handsome girl in the set before me trippedforward lightly to meet the opposite gentleman, tripped back again,grasped her dresses vigorously on both sides with her hands, raised thempretty high, danced an extraordinary jig that had more activity andexposure about it than any jig I ever saw before, and then, drawing herclothes still higher, she advanced gaily to the center and launched avicious kick full at her vis-a-vis that must infallibly have removed hisnose if he had been seven feet high. It was a mercy he was only six.
That is the can-can. The idea of it is to dance as wildly, as noisily,as furiously as you can; expose yourself as much as possible if you are awoman; and kick as high as you can, no matter which sex you belong to.There is no word of exaggeration in this. Any of the staid, respectable,aged people who were there that night can testify to the truth of thatstatement. There were a good many such people present. I suppose Frenchmorality is not of that straight-laced description which is shocked attrifles.
I moved aside and took a general view of the can-can. Shouts, laughter,furious music, a bewildering chaos of darting and intermingling forms,stormy jerking and snatching of gay dresses, bobbing beads, flying arms,lightning flashes of white-stockinged calves and dainty slippers in theair, and then a grand final rush, riot, a terrific hubbub, and a wildstampede! Heavens! Nothing like it has been seen on earth sincetrembling Tam O'Shanter saw the devil and the witches at their orgiesthat stormy night in "Alloway's auld haunted kirk."
We visited the Louvre, at a time when we had no silk purchases in view,and looked at its miles of paintings by the old masters. Some of themwere beautiful, but at the same time they carried such evidences aboutthem of the cringing spirit of those great men that we found smallpleasure in examining them. Their nauseous adulation of princely patronswas more prominent to me and chained my attention more surely than thecharms of color and expression which are claimed to be in the pictures.Gratitude for kindnesses is well, but it seems to me that some of thoseartists carried it so far that it ceased to be gratitude and becameworship. If there is a plausible excuse for the worship of men, then byall means let us forgive Rubens and his brethren.
But I will drop the subject, lest I say something about the old mastersthat might as well be left unsaid.
Of course we drove in the Bois de Boulogne, that limitless park, with itsforests, its lakes, its cascades, and its broad avenues. There werethousands upon thousands of vehicles abroad, and the scene was full oflife and gaiety. There were very common hacks, with father and motherand all the children in them; conspicuous little open carriages withcelebrated ladies of questionable reputation in them; there were Dukesand Duchesses abroad, with gorgeous footmen perched behind, and equallygorgeous outriders perched on each of the six horses; there were blue andsilver, and green and gold, and pink and black, and all sorts anddescriptions of stunning and startling liveries out, and I almost yearnedto be a flunkey myself, for the sake of the fine clothes.
But presently the Emperor came along and he outshone them all. He waspreceded by a bodyguard of gentlemen on horseback in showy uniforms, hiscarriage-horses (there appeared to be somewhere in the remoteneighborhood of a thousand of them,) were bestridden by gallant-lookingfellows, also in stylish uniforms, and after the carriage followedanother detachment of bodyguards. Everybody got out of the way;everybody bowed to the Emperor and his friend the Sultan; and they wentby on a swinging trot and disappeared.
I will not describe the Bois de Boulogne. I can not do it. It is simplya beautiful, cultivated, endless, wonderful wilderness. It is anenchanting place. It is in Paris now, one may say, but a crumbling oldcross in one portion of it reminds one that it was not always so. Thecross marks the spot where a celebrated troubadour was waylaid andmurdered in the fourteenth century. It was in this park that that fellowwith an unpronounceable name made the attempt upon the Russian Czar'slife last spring with a pistol. The bullet struck a tree. Fergusonshowed us the place. Now in America that interesting tree would bechopped down or forgotten within the next five years, but it will betreasured here. The guides will point it out to visitors for the nexteight hundred years, and when it decays and falls down they will put upanother there and go on with the same old story just the same.
