Let us not be too particular. It is better to have old second-handdiamonds than none at all. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
November 27. To-day we reached Gisborne, and anchored in a big bay;there was a heavy sea on, so we remained on board.
We were a mile from shore; a little steam-tug put out from the land; shewas an object of thrilling interest; she would climb to the summit of abillow, reel drunkenly there a moment, dim and gray in the driving stormof spindrift, then make a plunge like a diver and remain out of sightuntil one had given her up, then up she would dart again, on a steepslant toward the sky, shedding Niagaras of water from her forecastle--andthis she kept up, all the way out to us. She brought twenty-fivepassengers in her stomach--men and women mainly a traveling dramaticcompany. In sight on deck were the crew, in sou'westers, yellowwaterproof canvas suits, and boots to the thigh. The deck was neverquiet for a moment, and seldom nearer level than a ladder, and noble werethe seas which leapt aboard and went flooding aft. We rove a long lineto the yard-arm, hung a most primitive basketchair to it and swung it outinto the spacious air of heaven, and there it swayed, pendulum-fashion,waiting for its chance--then down it shot, skillfully aimed, and wasgrabbed by the two men on the forecastle. A young fellow belonging toour crew was in the chair, to be a protection to the lady-comers. Atonce a couple of ladies appeared from below, took seats in his lap, wehoisted them into the sky, waited a moment till the roll of the shipbrought them in overhead, then we lowered suddenly away, and seized thechair as it struck the deck. We took the twenty-five aboard, anddelivered twenty-five into the tug--among them several aged ladies, andone blind one--and all without accident. It was a fine piece of work.
Ours is a nice ship, roomy, comfortable, well-ordered, and satisfactory.Now and then we step on a rat in a hotel, but we have had no rats onshipboard lately; unless, perhaps in the Flora; we had more seriousthings to think of there, and did not notice. I have noticed that it isonly in ships and hotels which still employ the odious Chinese gong, thatyou find rats. The reason would seem to be, that as a rat cannot tellthe time of day by a clock, he won't stay where he cannot find out whendinner is ready.
November 29. The doctor tells me of several old drunkards, onespiritless loafer, and several far-gone moral wrecks who have beenreclaimed by the Salvation Army and have remained staunch people and hardworkers these two years. Wherever one goes, these testimonials to theArmy's efficiency are forthcoming . . . . This morning we had one ofthose whizzing green Ballarat flies in the room, with his stunningbuzz-saw noise--the swiftest creature in the world except thelightning-flash. It is a stupendous force that is stored up in thatlittle body. If we had it in a ship in the same proportion, we could spinfrom Liverpool to New York in the space of an hour--the time it takes toeat luncheon. The New Zealand express train is called the Ballarat Fly. . . . Bad teeth in the colonies. A citizen told me they don't haveteeth filled, but pull them out and put in false ones, and that now andthen one sees a young lady with a full set. She is fortunate. I wish Ihad been born with false teeth and a false liver and false carbuncles.I should get along better.
December 2. Monday. Left Napier in the Ballarat Fly the one that goestwice a week. From Napier to Hastings, twelve miles; time, fifty-fiveminutes--not so far short of thirteen miles an hour . . . . A perfectsummer day; cool breeze, brilliant sky, rich vegetation. Two or threetimes during the afternoon we saw wonderfully dense and beautifulforests, tumultuously piled skyward on the broken highlands--not thecustomary roof-like slant of a hillside, where the trees are all the sameheight. The noblest of these trees were of the Kauri breed, we were toldthe timber that is now furnishing the wood-paving for Europe, and is thebest of all wood for that purpose. Sometimes these towering upheavals offorestry were festooned and garlanded with vine-cables, and sometimes themasses of undergrowth were cocooned in another sort of vine of a delicatecobwebby texture--they call it the "supplejack," I think. Tree fernseverywhere--a stem fifteen feet high, with a graceful chalice offern-fronds sprouting from its top--a lovely forest ornament. And therewas a ten-foot reed with a flowing suit of what looked like yellow hairhanging from its upper end. I do not know its name, but if there is sucha thing as a scalp-plant, this is it. A romantic gorge, with a brookflowing in its bottom, approaching Palmerston North.
Waitukurau. Twenty minutes for luncheon. With me sat my wife anddaughter, and my manager, Mr. Carlyle Smythe. I sat at the head of thetable, and could see the right-hand wall; the others had their backs toit. On that wall, at a good distance away, were a couple of framedpictures. I could not see them clearly, but from the groupings of thefigures I fancied that they represented the killing of Napoleon III's sonby the Zulus in South Africa. I broke into the conversation, which wasabout poetry and cabbage and art, and said to my wife--
"Do you remember when the news came to Paris----"
"Of the killing of the Prince?"
(Those were the very words I had in my mind.) "Yes, but what Prince?"
"Napoleon. Lulu."
"What made you think of that?"
"I don't know."
There was no collusion. She had not seen the pictures, and they had notbeen mentioned. She ought to have thought of some recent news that cameto Paris, for we were but seven months from there and had been livingthere a couple of years when we started on this trip; but instead of thatshe thought of an incident of our brief sojourn in Paris of sixteen yearsbefore.
Here was a clear case of mental telegraphy; of mind-transference; of mymind telegraphing a thought into hers. How do I know? Because Itelegraphed an error. For it turned out that the pictures did notrepresent the killing of Lulu at all, nor anything connected with Lulu.She had to get the error from my head--it existed nowhere else.
