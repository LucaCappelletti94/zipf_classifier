Scattered here and there through the stacks of unpublishedmanuscript which constitute this formidable Autobiography and Diaryof mine, certain chapters will in some distant future be foundwhich deal with "Claimants"--claimants historically notorious:Satan, Claimant; the Golden Calf, Claimant; the Veiled Prophet ofKhorassan, Claimant; Louis XVII., Claimant; William Shakespeare,Claimant; Arthur Orton, Claimant; Mary Baker G. Eddy, Claimant--andthe rest of them. Eminent Claimants, successful Claimants,defeated Claimants, royal Claimants, pleb Claimants, showyClaimants, shabby Claimants, revered Claimants, despised Claimants,twinkle starlike here and there and yonder through the mists ofhistory and legend and tradition--and oh, all the darling tribe areclothed in mystery and romance, and we read about them with deepinterest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorousresentment, according to which side we hitch ourselves to. It hasalways been so with the human race. There was never a Claimantthat couldn't get a hearing, nor one that couldn't accumulate arapturous following, no matter how flimsy and apparentlyunauthentic his claim might be. Arthur Orton's claim that he wasthe lost Tichborne baronet come to life again was as flimsy as Mrs.Eddy's that she wrote Science and Health from the direct dictationof the Deity; yet in England near forty years ago Orton had a hugearmy of devotees and incorrigible adherents, many of whom remainedstubbornly unconvinced after their fat god had been proven animpostor and jailed as a perjurer, and to-day Mrs. Eddy's followingis not only immense, but is daily augmenting in numbers andenthusiasm. Orton had many fine and educated minds among hisadherents, Mrs. Eddy has had the like among hers from thebeginning. Her church is as well equipped in those particulars asis any other church. Claimants can always count upon a following,it doesn't matter who they are, nor what they claim, nor whetherthey come with documents or without. It was always so. Down outof the long-vanished past, across the abyss of the ages, if youlisten you can still hear the believing multitudes shouting forPerkin Warbeck and Lambert Simnel.
A friend has sent me a new book, from England--The ShakespeareProblem Restated--well restated and closely reasoned; and my fiftyyears' interest in that matter--asleep for the last three years--isexcited once more. It is an interest which was born of DeliaBacon's book--away back in that ancient day--1857, or maybe 1856.About a year later my pilot-master, Bixby, transferred me from hisown steamboat to the Pennsylvania, and placed me under the ordersand instructions of George Ealer--dead now, these many, many years.I steered for him a good many months--as was the humble duty of thepilot-apprentice: stood a daylight watch and spun the wheel underthe severe superintendence and correction of the master. He was aprime chess player and an idolater of Shakespeare. He would playchess with anybody; even with me, and it cost his official dignitysomething to do that. Also--quite uninvited--he would readShakespeare to me; not just casually, but by the hour, when it washis watch, and I was steering. He read well, but not profitablyfor me, because he constantly injected commands into the text.That broke it all up, mixed it all up, tangled it all up--to thatdegree, in fact, that if we were in a risky and difficult piece ofriver an ignorant person couldn't have told, sometimes, whichobservations were Shakespeare's and which were Ealer's. Forinstance:
What man dare, _I_ dare!
Approach thou WHAT are you laying in the leads for? what a hell ofan idea! like the rugged ease her off a little, ease her off!rugged Russian bear, the armed rhinoceros or the THERE she goes!meet her, meet her! didn't you KNOW she'd smell the reef if youcrowded it like that? Hyrcan tiger; take any shape but that and myfirm nerves she'll be in the WOODS the first you know! stop thestarboard! come ahead strong on the larboard! back the starboard! .. . NOW then, you're all right; come ahead on the starboard;straighten up and go 'long, never tremble: or be alive again, anddare me to the desert damnation can't you keep away from thatgreasy water? pull her down! snatch her! snatch her baldheaded!with thy sword; if trembling I inhabit then, lay in the leads!--no,only the starboard one, leave the other alone, protest me the babyof a girl. Hence horrible shadow! eight bells--that watchman'sasleep again, I reckon, go down and call Brown yourself, unrealmockery, hence!"
He certainly was a good reader, and splendidly thrilling and stormyand tragic, but it was a damage to me, because I have never sincebeen able to read Shakespeare in a calm and sane way. I cannot ridit of his explosive interlardings, they break in everywhere withtheir irrelevant "What in hell are you up to NOW! pull her down!more! MORE!--there now, steady as you go," and the otherdisorganizing interruptions that were always leaping from hismouth. When I read Shakespeare now, I can hear them as plainly asI did in that long-departed time--fifty-one years ago. I neverregarded Ealer's readings as educational. Indeed they were adetriment to me.
His contributions to the text seldom improved it, but barring thatdetail he was a good reader, I can say that much for him. He didnot use the book, and did not need to; he knew his Shakespeare aswell as Euclid ever knew his multiplication table.
Did he have something to say--this Shakespeare-adoring Mississippipilot--anent Delia Bacon's book? Yes. And he said it; said it allthe time, for months--in the morning watch, the middle watch, thedog watch; and probably kept it going in his sleep. He bought theliterature of the dispute as fast as it appeared, and we discussedit all through thirteen hundred miles of river four times traversedin every thirty-five days--the time required by that swift boat toachieve two round trips. We discussed, and discussed, anddiscussed, and disputed and disputed and disputed; at any rate hedid, and I got in a word now and then when he slipped a cog andthere was a vacancy. He did his arguing with heat, with energy,with violence; and I did mine with the reserve and moderation of asubordinate who does not like to be flung out of a pilot-house thatis perched forty feet above the water. He was fiercely loyal toShakespeare and cordially scornful of Bacon and of all thepretensions of the Baconians. So was I--at first. And at first hewas glad that that was my attitude. There were even indicationsthat he admired it; indications dimmed, it is true, by the distancethat lay between the lofty boss-pilotical altitude and my lowlyone, yet perceptible to me; perceptible, and translatable into acompliment--compliment coming down from above the snow-line and notwell thawed in the transit, and not likely to set anything afire,not even a cub-pilot's self-conceit; still a detectable compliment,and precious.
Naturally it flattered me into being more loyal to Shakespeare--ifpossible--than I was before, and more prejudiced against Bacon--ifpossible than I was before. And so we discussed and discussed,both on the same side, and were happy. For a while. Only for awhile. Only for a very little while, a very, very, very littlewhile. Then the atmosphere began to change; began to cool off.
A brighter person would have seen what the trouble was, earlierthan I did, perhaps, but I saw it early enough for all practicalpurposes. You see, he was of an argumentative disposition.Therefore it took him but a little time to get tired of arguingwith a person who agreed with everything he said and consequentlynever furnished him a provocative to flare up and show what hecould do when it came to clear, cold, hard, rose-cut, hundred-faceted, diamond-flashing reasoning. That was his name for it. Ithas been applied since, with complacency, as many as several times,in the Bacon-Shakespeare scuffle. On the Shakespeare side.
Then the thing happened which has happened to more persons than tome when principle and personal interest found themselves inopposition to each other and a choice had to be made: I letprinciple go, and went over to the other side. Not the entire way,but far enough to answer the requirements of the case. That is tosay, I took this attitude, to wit: I only BELIEVED Bacon wroteShakespeare, whereas I KNEW Shakespeare didn't. Ealer wassatisfied with that, and the war broke loose. Study, practice,experience in handling my end of the matter presently enabled me totake my new position almost seriously; a little bit later, utterlyseriously; a little later still, lovingly, gratefully, devotedly;finally: fiercely, rabidly, uncompromisingly. After that, I waswelded to my faith, I was theoretically ready to die for it, and Ilooked down with compassion not unmixed with scorn, upon everybodyelse's faith that didn't tally with mine. That faith, imposed uponme by self-interest in that ancient day, remains my faith to-day,and in it I find comfort, solace, peace, and never-failing joy.You see how curiously theological it is. The "rice Christian" ofthe Orient goes through the very same steps, when he is after riceand the missionary is after HIM; he goes for rice, and remains toworship.
Ealer did a lot of our "reasoning"--not to say substantially all ofit. The slaves of his cult have a passion for calling it by thatlarge name. We others do not call our inductions and deductionsand reductions by any name at all. They show for themselves, whatthey are, and we can with tranquil confidence leave the world toennoble them with a title of its own choosing.
Now and then when Ealer had to stop to cough, I pulled myinduction-talents together and hove the controversial lead myself:always getting eight feet, eight-and-a-half, often nine, sometimeseven quarter-less-twain--as _I_ believed; but always "no bottom,"as HE said.
I got the best of him only once. I prepared myself. I wrote out apassage from Shakespeare--it may have been the very one I quoted awhile ago, I don't remember--and riddled it with his wildsteamboatful interlardings. When an unrisky opportunity offered,one lovely summer day, when we had sounded and buoyed a tangledpatch of crossings known as Hell's Half Acre, and were aboard againand he had sneaked the Pennsylvania triumphantly through it withoutonce scraping sand, and the A. T. Lacey had followed in our wakeand got stuck, and he was feeling good, I showed it to him. Itamused him. I asked him to fire it off: read it; read it, Idiplomatically added, as only he could read dramatic poetry. Thecompliment touched him where he lived. He did read it; read itwith surpassing fire and spirit; read it as it will never be readagain; for HE knew how to put the right music into those thunderousinterlardings and make them seem a part of the text, make themsound as if they were bursting from Shakespeare's own soul, eachone of them a golden inspiration and not to be left out withoutdamage to the massed and magnificent whole.
I waited a week, to let the incident fade; waited longer; waiteduntil he brought up for reasonings and vituperation my petposition, my pet argument, the one which I was fondest of, the onewhich I prized far above all others in my ammunition-wagon, to wit:that Shakespeare couldn't have written Shakespeare's works, for thereason that the man who wrote them was limitlessly familiar withthe laws, and the law-courts, and law-proceedings, and lawyer-talk,and lawyer-ways--and if Shakespeare was possessed of theinfinitely-divided star-dust that constituted this vast wealth, howdid he get it, and WHERE, and WHEN?
"From books."
From books! That was always the idea. I answered as my readingsof the champions of my side of the great controversy had taught meto answer: that a man can't handle glibly and easily andcomfortably and successfully the argot of a trade at which he hasnot personally served. He will make mistakes; he will not, andcannot, get the trade-phrasings precisely and exactly right; andthe moment he departs, by even a shade, from a common trade-form,the reader who has served that trade will know the writer HASN'T.Ealer would not be convinced; he said a man could learn how tocorrectly handle the subtleties and mysteries and free-masonries ofany trade by careful reading and studying. But when I got him toread again the passage from Shakespeare with the interlardings, heperceived, himself, that books couldn't teach a student abewildering multitude of pilot-phrases so thoroughly and perfectlythat he could talk them off in book and play or conversation andmake no mistake that a pilot would not immediately discover. Itwas a triumph for me. He was silent awhile, and I knew what washappening: he was losing his temper. And I knew he wouldpresently close the session with the same old argument that wasalways his stay and his support in time of need; the same oldargument, the one I couldn't answer--because I dasn't: theargument that I was an ass, and better shut up. He delivered it,and I obeyed.
Oh, dear, how long ago it was--how pathetically long ago! And heream I, old, forsaken, forlorn and alone, arranging to get thatargument out of somebody again.
When a man has a passion for Shakespeare, it goes without sayingthat he keeps company with other standard authors. Ealer alwayshad several high-class books in the pilot-house, and he read thesame ones over and over again, and did not care to change to newerand fresher ones. He played well on the flute, and greatly enjoyedhearing himself play. So did I. He had a notion that a flutewould keep its health better if you took it apart when it was notstanding a watch; and so, when it was not on duty it took its rest,disjointed, on the compass-shelf under the breast-board. When thePennsylvania blew up and became a drifting rack-heap freighted withwounded and dying poor souls (my young brother Henry among them),pilot Brown had the watch below, and was probably asleep and neverknew what killed him; but Ealer escaped unhurt. He and his pilot-house were shot up into the air; then they fell, and Ealer sankthrough the ragged cavern where the hurricane deck and the boilerdeck had been, and landed in a nest of ruins on the main deck, ontop of one of the unexploded boilers, where he lay prone in a fogof scalding and deadly steam. But not for long. He did not losehis head: long familiarity with danger had taught him to keep it,in any and all emergencies. He held his coat-lappels to his nosewith one hand, to keep out the steam, and scrabbled around with theother till he found the joints of his flute, then he is tookmeasures to save himself alive, and was successful. I was not onboard. I had been put ashore in New Orleans by CaptainKlinefelter. The reason--however, I have told all about it in thebook called Old Times on the Mississippi, and it isn't importantanyway, it is so long ago.
