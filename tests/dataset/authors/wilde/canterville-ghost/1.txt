When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American Minister, bought Canterville Chase,every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was nodoubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Cantervillehimself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it hisduty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.
"We have not cared to live in the place ourselves," said LordCanterville, "since my grandaunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, wasfrightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by twoskeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing fordinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has beenseen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector ofthe parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of King'sCollege, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, noneof our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville oftengot very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noisesthat came from the corridor and the library."
"My Lord," answered the Minister, "I will take the furniture and theghost at a valuation. I have come from a modern country, where we haveeverything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellowspainting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actors andprima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost inEurope, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our publicmuseums, or on the road as a show."
"I fear that the ghost exists," said Lord Canterville, smiling, "thoughit may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. Ithas been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and alwaysmakes its appearance before the death of any member of our family."
"Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. Butthere is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of Natureare not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy."
"You are certainly very natural in America," answered Lord Canterville,who did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, "and if youdon't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must rememberI warned you."

A few weeks after this, the purchase was concluded, and at the close ofthe season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase.Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53d Street, had beena celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome, middle-aged woman,with fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leavingtheir native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under theimpression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis hadnever fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and areally wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, shewas quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that wehave really everything in common with America nowadays, except, ofcourse, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parentsin a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was afair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himselffor American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino forthree successive seasons, and even in London was well known as anexcellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses.Otherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a littlegirl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedomin her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful Amazon, and had once racedold Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a lengthand a half, just in front of the Achilles statue, to the huge delight ofthe young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed for her on the spot, and wassent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears.After Virginia came the twins, who were usually called "The Star andStripes," as they were always getting swished. They were delightfulboys, and, with the exception of the worthy Minister, the only truerepublicans of the family.

As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railwaystation, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, andthey started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely Julyevening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Nowand then they heard a wood-pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, orsaw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant.Little squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by,and the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossyknolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue ofCanterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast withclouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a greatflight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before theyreached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.
Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressedin black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, thehousekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, hadconsented to keep in her former position. She made them each a lowcurtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner,"I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase." Following her, they passedthrough the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelledin black oak, at the end of which was a large stained glass window. Herethey found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps,they sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.
Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just bythe fireplace, and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, saidto Mrs. Umney, "I am afraid something has been spilt there."
"Yes, madam," replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, "blood hasbeen spilt on that spot."
[Illustration: "BLOOD HAS BEEN SPILLED ON THAT SPOT"]
"How horrid!" cried Mrs. Otis; "I don't at all care for blood-stains ina sitting-room. It must be removed at once."
The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice,"It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered onthat very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under verymysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but hisguilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been muchadmired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed."
"That is all nonsense," cried Washington Otis; "Pinkerton's ChampionStain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time," andbefore the terrified housekeeper could interfere, he had fallen upon hisknees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of whatlooked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of theblood-stain could be seen.
"I knew Pinkerton would do it," he exclaimed, triumphantly, as helooked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said thesewords than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, afearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs.Umney fainted.
"What a monstrous climate!" said the American Minister, calmly, as helit a long cheroot. "I guess the old country is so overpopulated thatthey have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been ofopinion that emigration is the only thing for England."
"My dear Hiram," cried Mrs. Otis, "what can we do with a woman whofaints?"
"Charge it to her like breakages," answered the Minister; "she won'tfaint after that;" and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to.There was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and shesternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.
"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir," she said, "that would makeany Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have notclosed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here." Mr.Otis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that theywere not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings ofProvidence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements foran increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.
