Irreverence
One of the most trying defects which I find in these--these--whatshall I call them? for I will not apply injurious epithets to them,the way they do to us, such violations of courtesy being repugnantto my nature and my dignity. The furthest I can go in thatdirection is to call them by names of limited reverence--namesmerely descriptive, never unkind, never offensive, never tainted byharsh feeling. If THEY would do like this, they would feel betterin their hearts. Very well, then--to proceed. One of the mosttrying defects which I find in these Stratfordolaters, theseShakesperoids, these thugs, these bangalores, these troglodytes,these herumfrodites, these blatherskites, these buccaneers, thesebandoleers, is their spirit of irreverence. It is detectable inevery utterance of theirs when they are talking about us. I amthankful that in me there is nothing of that spirit. When a thingis sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward it.I cannot call to mind a single instance where I have ever beenirreverent, except toward the things which were sacred to otherpeople. Am I in the right? I think so. But I ask no one to takemy unsupported word; no, look at the dictionary; let the dictionarydecide. Here is the definition:
Irreverence. The quality or condition of irreverence toward Godand sacred things.
What does the Hindu say? He says it is correct. He saysirreverence is lack of respect for Vishnu, and Brahma, andChrishna, and his other gods, and for his sacred cattle, and forhis temples and the things within them. He endorses thedefinition, you see; and there are 300,000,000 Hindus or theirequivalents back of him.
The dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital G itcould restrict irreverence to lack of reverence for OUR Deity andour sacred things, but that ingenious and rather sly ideamiscarried: for by the simple process of spelling HIS deities withcapitals the Hindu confiscates the definition and restricts it tohis own sects, thus making it clearly compulsory upon us to revereHIS gods and HIS sacred things, and nobody's else. We can't say aword, for he has our own dictionary at his back, and its decisionis final.
This law, reduced to its simplest terms, is this: 1. Whatever issacred to the Christian must be held in reverence by everybodyelse; 2, whatever is sacred to the Hindu must be held in reverenceby everybody else; 3, therefore, by consequence, logically, andindisputably, whatever is sacred to ME must be held in reverence byeverybody else.
Now then, what aggravates me is, that these troglodytes andmuscovites and bandoleers and buccaneers are ALSO trying to crowdin and share the benefit of the law, and compel everybody to reveretheir Shakespeare and hold him sacred. We can't have that:there's enough of us already. If you go on widening and spreadingand inflating the privilege, it will presently come to be concededthat each man's sacred things are the ONLY ones, and the rest ofthe human race will have to be humbly reverent toward them orsuffer for it. That can surely happen, and when it happens, theword Irreverence will be regarded as the most meaningless, andfoolish, and self-conceited, and insolent, and impudent anddictatorial word in the language. And people will say, "Whosebusiness is it, what gods I worship and what things hold sacred?Who has the right to dictate to my conscience, and where did he getthat right?"
We cannot afford to let that calamity come upon us. We must savethe word from this destruction. There is but one way to do it, andthat is, to stop the spread of the privilege, and strictly confineit to its present limits: that is, to all the Christian sects, toall the Hindu sects, and me. We do not need any more, the stock iswatered enough, just as it is.
It would be better if the privilege were limited to me alone. Ithink so because I am the only sect that knows how to employ itgently, kindly, charitably, dispassionately. The other sects lackthe quality of self-restraint. The Catholic Church says the mostirreverent things about matters which are sacred to theProtestants, and the Protestant Church retorts in kind about theconfessional and other matters which Catholics hold sacred; thenboth of these irreverencers turn upon Thomas Paine and charge HIMwith irreverence. This is all unfortunate, because it makes itdifficult for students equipped with only a low grade of mentalityto find out what Irreverence really IS.
It will surely be much better all around if the privilege ofregulating the irreverent and keeping them in order shalleventually be withdrawn from all the sects but me. Then there willbe no more quarrelling, no more bandying of disrespectful epithets,no more heart burnings.
There will then be nothing sacred involved in this Bacon-Shakespeare controversy except what is sacred to me. That willsimplify the whole matter, and trouble will cease. There will beirreverence no longer, because I will not allow it. The first timethose criminals charge me with irreverence for calling theirStratford myth an Arthur-Orton-Mary-Baker-Thompson-Eddy-Louis-the-Seventeenth-Veiled-Prophet-of-Khorassan will be the last. Taughtby the methods found effective in extinguishing earlier offendersby the Inquisition, of holy memory, I shall know how to quiet them.
