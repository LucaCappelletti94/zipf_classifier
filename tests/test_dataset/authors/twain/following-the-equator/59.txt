We were driven over Sir Colin Campbell's route by a British officer, andwhen I arrived at the Residency I was so familiar with the road that Icould have led a retreat over it myself; but the compass in my head hasbeen out of order from my birth, and so, as soon as I was within thebattered Bailie Guard and turned about to review the march and imaginethe relieving forces storming their way along it, everything was upsidedown and wrong end first in a moment, and I was never able to getstraightened out again.  And now, when I look at the battle-plan, theconfusion remains.  In me the east was born west, the battle-plans whichhave the east on the right-hand side are of no use to me.
The Residency ruins are draped with flowering vines, and are impressiveand beautiful.  They and the grounds are sacred now, and will suffer noneglect nor be profaned by any sordid or commercial use while the Britishremain masters of India.  Within the grounds are buried the dead who gaveup their lives there in the long siege.
After a fashion, I was able to imagine the fiery storm that raged nightand day over the place during so many months, and after a fashion I couldimagine the men moving through it, but I could not satisfactorily placethe 200 women, and I could do nothing at all with the 250 children.  Iknew by Lady Inglis' diary that the children carried on their smallaffairs very much as if blood and carnage and the crash and thunder of asiege were natural and proper features of nursery life, and I tried torealize it; but when her little Johnny came rushing, all excitement,through the din and smoke, shouting, "Oh, mamma, the white hen has laidan egg!"  I saw that I could not do it.  Johnny's place was under thebed.  I could imagine him there, because I could imagine myself there;and I think I should not have been interested in a hen that was laying anegg; my interest would have been with the parties that were laying thebombshells.  I sat at dinner with one of those children in the Club'sIndian palace, and I knew that all through the siege he was perfectinghis teething and learning to talk; and while to me he was the mostimpressive object in Lucknow after the Residency ruins, I was not able toimagine what his life had been during that tempestuous infancy of his,nor what sort of a curious surprise it must have been to him to bemarched suddenly out into a strange dumb world where there wasn't anynoise, and nothing going on.  He was only forty-one when I saw him, astrangely youthful link to connect the present with so ancient an episodeas the Great Mutiny.
By and by we saw Cawnpore, and the open lot which was the scene ofMoore's memorable defense, and the spot on the shore of the Ganges wherethe massacre of the betrayed garrison occurred, and the small Indiantemple whence the bugle-signal notified the assassins to fall on.  Thislatter was a lonely spot, and silent.  The sluggish river drifted by,almost currentless.  It was dead low water, narrow channels with vastsandbars between, all the way across the wide bed; and the only livingthing in sight was that grotesque and solemn bald-headed bird, theAdjutant, standing on his six-foot stilts, solitary on a distant bar,with his head sunk between his shoulders, thinking; thinking of hisprize, I suppose--the dead Hindoo that lay awash at his feet, and whetherto eat him alone or invite friends.  He and his prey were a proper accentto that mournful place.  They were in keeping with it, they emphasizedits loneliness and its solemnity.
And we saw the scene of the slaughter of the helpless women and children,and also the costly memorial that is built over the well which containstheir remains.  The Black Hole of Calcutta is gone, but a more reverentage is come, and whatever remembrancer still exists of the moving andheroic sufferings and achievements of the garrisons of Lucknow andCawnpore will be guarded and preserved.
In Agra and its neighborhood, and afterwards at Delhi, we saw forts,mosques, and tombs, which were built in the great days of the Mohammedanemperors, and which are marvels of cost, magnitude, and richness ofmaterials and ornamentation, creations of surpassing grandeur, wonderswhich do indeed make the like things in the rest of the world seem tameand inconsequential by comparison.  I am not purposing to describe them.By good fortune I had not read too much about them, and therefore wasable to get a natural and rational focus upon them, with the result thatthey thrilled, blessed, and exalted me.  But if I had previouslyoverheated my imagination by drinking too much pestilential literary hotScotch, I should have suffered disappointment and sorrow.
I mean to speak of only one of these many world-renowned buildings, theTaj Mahal, the most celebrated construction in the earth.  I had read agreat deal too much about it.  I saw it in the daytime, I saw it in themoonlight, I saw it near at hand, I saw it from a distance; and I knewall the time, that of its kind it was the wonder of the world, with nocompetitor now and no possible future competitor; and yet, it was not myTaj.  My Taj had been built by excitable literary people; it was solidlylodged in my head, and I could not blast it out.
I wish to place before the reader some of the usual descriptions of theTaj, and ask him to take note of the impressions left in his mind.  Thesedescriptions do really state the truth--as nearly as the limitations oflanguage will allow.  But language is a treacherous thing, a most unsurevehicle, and it can seldom arrange descriptive words in such a way thatthey will not inflate the facts--by help of the reader's imagination,which is always ready to take a hand, and work for nothing, and do thebulk of it at that.
I will begin with a few sentences from the excellent little localguide-book of Mr. Satya Chandra Mukerji.  I take them from here and therein his description:
     "The inlaid work of the Taj and the flowers and petals that are to     be found on all sides on the surface of the marble evince a most     delicate touch."
That is true.
     "The inlaid work, the marble, the flowers, the buds, the leaves, the     petals, and the lotus stems are almost without a rival in the whole     of the civilized world."
     "The work of inlaying with stones and gems is found in the highest     perfection in the Taj."
Gems, inlaid flowers, buds, and leaves to be found on all sides.  What doyou see before you?  Is the fairy structure growing?  Is it becoming ajewel casket?
     "The whole of the Taj produces a wonderful effect that is equally     sublime and beautiful."
Then Sir William Wilson Hunter:
     "The Taj Mahal with its beautiful domes, 'a dream of marble,' rises     on the river bank."
     "The materials are white marble and red sandstone."
     "The complexity of its design and the delicate intricacy of the     workmanship baffle description."
Sir William continues.  I will italicize some of his words:
     "The mausoleum stands on a raised marble platform at each of whose     corners rises a tall and slender minaret of graceful proportions and     of exquisite beauty.  Beyond the platform stretch the two wings, one     of which is itself a mosque of great architectural merit.  In the     center of the whole design the mausoleum occupies a square of 186     feet, with the angles deeply truncated so also form an unequal     octagon.  The main feature in this central pile is the great dome,     which swells upward to nearly two-thirds of a sphere and tapers at     its extremity into a pointed spire crowned by a crescent.  Beneath     it an enclosure of marble trellis-work surrounds the tomb of the     princess and of her husband, the Emperor.  Each corner of the     mausoleum is covered by a similar though much smaller dome erected     on a pediment pierced with graceful Saracenic arches.  Light is     admitted into the interior through a double screen of pierced     marble, which tempers the glare of an Indian sky while its whiteness     prevents the mellow effect from degenerating into gloom.  The     internal decorations consist of inlaid work in precious stones, such     as agate, jasper, etc., with which every squandril or salient point     in the architecture is richly fretted.  Brown and violet marble is     also freely employed in wreaths, scrolls, and lintels to relieve the     monotony of white wall.  In regard to color and design, the interior     of the Taj may rank first in the world for purely decorative     workmanship; while the perfect symmetry of its exterior, once seen     can never be forgotten, nor the aerial grace of its domes, rising     like marble bubbles into the clear sky.  The Taj represents the most     highly elaborated stage of ornamentation reached by the     Indo-Mohammedan builders, the stage in which the architect ends and     the jeweler begins.  In its magnificent gateway the diagonal     ornamentation at the corners, which satisfied the designers of the     gateways of Itimad-ud-doulah and Sikandra mausoleums is superseded     by fine marble cables, in bold twists, strong and handsome.  The     triangular insertions of white marble and large flowers have in like     manner given place to fine inlaid work.  Firm perpendicular lines in     black marble with well proportioned panels of the same material are     effectively used in the interior of the gateway.  On its top the     Hindu brackets and monolithic architraves of Sikandra are replaced     by Moorish carped arches, usually single blocks of red sandstone, in     the Kiosks and pavilions which adorn the roof.  From the pillared     pavilions a magnificent view is obtained of the Taj gardens below,     with the noble Jumna river at their farther end, and the city and     fort of Agra in the distance.  From this beautiful and splendid     gateway one passes up a straight alley shaded by evergreen trees     cooled by a broad shallow piece of water running along the middle of     the path to the Taj itself.  The Taj is entirely of marble and gems.     The red sandstone of the other Mohammedan buildings has entirely     disappeared, or rather the red sandstone which used to form the     thickness of the walls, is in the Taj itself overlaid completely     with white marble, and the white marble is itself inlaid with     precious stones arranged in lovely patterns of flowers.  A feeling     of purity impresses itself on the eye and the mind from the absence     of the coarser material which forms so invariable a material in Agra     architecture.  The lower wall and panels are covered with tulips,     oleanders, and fullblown lilies, in flat carving on the white     marble; and although the inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very     brilliant when looked at closely, there is on the whole but little     color, and the all-prevailing sentiment is one of whiteness,     silence, and calm.  The whiteness is broken only by the fine color     of the inlaid gems, by lines in black marble, and by delicately     written inscriptions, also in black, from the Koran.  Under the dome     of the vast mausoleum a high and beautiful screen of open tracery in     white marble rises around the two tombs, or rather cenotaphs of the     emperor and his princess; and in this marvel of marble the carving     has advanced from the old geometrical patterns to a trellis-work of     flowers and foliage, handled with great freedom and spirit.  The two     cenotaphs in the center of the exquisite enclosure have no carving     except the plain Kalamdan or oblong pen-box on the tomb of Emperor     Shah Jehan.  But both cenotaphs are inlaid with flowers made of     costly gems, and with the ever graceful oleander scroll."
Bayard Taylor, after describing the details of the Taj, goes on to say:
     "On both sides the palm, the banyan, and the feathery bamboo mingle     their foliage; the song of birds meets your ears, and the odor of     roses and lemon flowers sweetens the air.  Down such a vista and     over such a foreground rises the Taj.  There is no mystery, no sense     of partial failure about the Taj.  A thing of perfect beauty and of     absolute finish in every detail, it might pass for the work of genii     who knew naught of the weaknesses and ills with which mankind are     beset."
All of these details are true.  But, taken together, they state afalsehood--to you.  You cannot add them up correctly.  Those writers knowthe values of their words and phrases, but to you the words and phrasesconvey other and uncertain values.  To those writers their phrases havevalues which I think I am now acquainted with; and for the help of thereader I will here repeat certain of those words and phrases, and followthem with numerals which shall represent those values--then we shall seethe difference between a writer's ciphering and a mistaken reader's--
Precious stones, such as agate, jasper, etc.--5.
With which every salient point is richly fretted--5.
First in the world for purely decorative workmanship--9.
The Taj represents the stage where the architect ends and the jewelerbegins--5.
The Taj is entirely of marble and gems--7.
Inlaid with precious stones in lovely patterns of flowers--5.
The inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very brilliant(followed by a most important modification which the reader is sure toread too carelessly)--2.
The vast mausoleum--5.
This marvel of marble--5.
The exquisite enclosure--5.
Inlaid with flowers made of costly gems--5.
A thing of perfect beauty and absolute finish--5.
Those details are correct; the figures which I have placed after themrepresent quite fairly their individual, values.  Then why, as a whole,do they convey a false impression to the reader?  It is because thereader--beguiled by, his heated imagination--masses them in the wrongway.  The writer would mass the first three figures in the following way,and they would speak the truth.
Total--19
But the reader masses them thus--and then they tell a lie--559.
The writer would add all of his twelve numerals together, and then thesum would express the whole truth about the Taj, and the truth only--63.
But the reader--always helped by his imagination--would put the figuresin a row one after the other, and get this sum, which would tell him anoble big lie:
559575255555.
You must put in the commas yourself; I have to go on with my work.
The reader will always be sure to put the figures together in that wrongway, and then as surely before him will stand, sparkling in the sun, agem-crusted Taj tall as the Matterhorn.
I had to visit Niagara fifteen times before I succeeded in getting myimaginary Falls gauged to the actuality and could begin to sanely andwholesomely wonder at them for what they were, not what I had expectedthem to be.  When I first approached them it was with my face liftedtoward the sky, for I thought I was going to see an Atlantic oceanpouring down thence over cloud-vexed Himalayan heights, a sea-green wallof water sixty miles front and six miles high, and so, when the toyreality came suddenly into view--that beruiled little wet apron hangingout to dry--the shock was too much for me, and I fell with a dull thud.
Yet slowly, surely, steadily, in the course of my fifteen visits, theproportions adjusted themselves to the facts, and I came at last torealize that a waterfall a hundred and sixty-five feet high and a quarterof a mile wide was an impressive thing.  It was not a dipperful to myvanished great vision, but it would answer.
I know that I ought to do with the Taj as I was obliged to do withNiagara--see it fifteen times, and let my mind gradually get rid of theTaj built in it by its describers, by help of my imagination, andsubstitute for it the Taj of fact.  It would be noble and fine, then, anda marvel; not the marvel which it replaced, but still a marvel, and fineenough.  I am a careless reader, I suppose--an impressionist reader; animpressionist reader of what is not an impressionist picture; a readerwho overlooks the informing details or masses their sum improperly, andgets only a large splashy, general effect--an effect which is notcorrect, and which is not warranted by the particulars placed before meparticulars which I did not examine, and whose meanings I did notcautiously and carefully estimate.  It is an effect which is somethirty-five or forty times finer than the reality, and is therefore agreat deal better and more valuable than the reality; and so, I oughtnever to hunt up the reality, but stay miles away from it, and thuspreserve undamaged my own private mighty Niagara tumbling out of thevault of heaven, and my own ineffable Taj, built of tinted mists uponjeweled arches of rainbows supported by colonnades of moonlight.  It is amistake for a person with an unregulated imagination to go and look at anillustrious world's wonder.
I suppose that many, many years ago I gathered the idea that the Taj'splace in the achievements of man was exactly the place of the ice-stormin the achievements of Nature; that the Taj represented man's supremestpossibility in the creation of grace and beauty and exquisiteness andsplendor, just as the ice-storm represents Nature's supremest possibilityin the combination of those same qualities.  I do not know how long agothat idea was bred in me, but I know that I cannot remember back to atime when the thought of either of these symbols of gracious andunapproachable perfection did not at once suggest the other.  If Ithought of the ice-storm, the Taj rose before me divinely beautiful; if Ithought of the Taj, with its encrustings and inlayings of jewels, thevision of the ice-storm rose.  And so, to me, all these years, the Tajhas had no rival among the temples and palaces of men, none that evenremotely approached it it was man's architectural ice-storm.
Here in London the other night I was talking with some Scotch and Englishfriends, and I mentioned the ice-storm, using it as a figure--a figurewhich failed, for none of them had heard of the ice-storm.  Onegentleman, who was very familiar with American literature, said he hadnever seen it mentioned in any book.  That is strange.  And I, myself,was not able to say that I had seen it mentioned in a book; and yet theautumn foliage, with all other American scenery, has received full andcompetent attention.
The oversight is strange, for in America the ice-storm is an event.  Andit is not an event which one is careless about.  When it comes, the newsflies from room to room in the house, there are bangings on the doors,and shoutings, "The ice-storm! the ice-storm!" and even the laziestsleepers throw off the covers and join the rush for the windows.  Theice-storm occurs in midwinter, and usually its enchantments are wroughtin the silence and the darkness of the night.  A fine drizzling rainfalls hour after hour upon the naked twigs and branches of the trees, andas it falls it freezes.  In time the trunk and every branch and twig areincased in hard pure ice; so that the tree looks like a skeleton treemade all of glass--glass that is crystal-clear.  All along the undersideof every branch and twig is a comb of little icicles--the frozen drip.Sometimes these pendants do not quite amount to icicles, but are roundbeads--frozen tears.
The weather clears, toward dawn, and leaves a brisk pure atmosphere and asky without a shred of cloud in it--and everything is still, there is nota breath of wind.  The dawn breaks and spreads, the news of the stormgoes about the house, and the little and the big, in wraps and blankets,flock to the window and press together there, and gaze intently out uponthe great white ghost in the grounds, and nobody says a word, nobodystirs.  All are waiting; they know what is coming, and they are waitingwaiting for the miracle.  The minutes drift on and on and on, with not asound but the ticking of the clock; at last the sun fires a sudden sheafof rays into the ghostly tree and turns it into a white splendor ofglittering diamonds.  Everybody catches his breath, and feels a swellingin his throat and a moisture in his eyes-but waits again; for he knowswhat is coming; there is more yet.  The sun climbs higher, and stillhigher, flooding the tree from its loftiest spread of branches to itslowest, turning it to a glory of white fire; then in a moment, withoutwarning, comes the great miracle, the supreme miracle, the miraclewithout its fellow in the earth; a gust of wind sets every branch andtwig to swaying, and in an instant turns the whole white tree into aspouting and spraying explosion of flashing gems of every conceivablecolor; and there it stands and sways this way and that, flash! flash!flash! a dancing and glancing world of rubies, emeralds, diamonds,sapphires, the most radiant spectacle, the most blinding spectacle, thedivinest, the most exquisite, the most intoxicating vision of fire andcolor and intolerable and unimaginable splendor that ever any eye hasrested upon in this world, or will ever rest upon outside of the gates ofheaven.
By, all my senses, all my faculties, I know that the icestorm is Nature'ssupremest achievement in the domain of the superb and the beautiful; andby my reason, at least, I know that the Taj is man's ice-storm.
In the ice-storm every one of the myriad ice-beads pendant from twig andbranch is an individual gem, and changes color with every motion causedby the wind; each tree carries a million, and a forest-front exhibits thesplendors of the single tree multiplied by a thousand.
It occurs to me now that I have never seen the ice-storm put upon canvas,and have not heard that any painter has tried to do it.  I wonder whythat is.  Is it that paint cannot counterfeit the intense blaze of asun-flooded jewel?  There should be, and must be, a reason, and a good one,why the most enchanting sight that Nature has created has been neglectedby the brush.
Often, the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the stricttruth.  The describers of the Taj have used the word gem in its strictestsense--its scientific sense.  In that sense it is a mild word, andpromises but little to the eye-nothing bright, nothing brilliant, nothingsparkling, nothing splendid in the way of color.  It accurately describesthe sober and unobtrusive gem-work of the Taj; that is, to the veryhighly-educated one person in a thousand; but it most falsely describesit to the 999.  But the 999 are the people who ought to be especiallytaken care of, and to them it does not mean quiet-colored designs wroughtin carnelians, or agates, or such things; they know the word in its wideand ordinary sense only, and so to them it means diamonds and rubies andopals and their kindred, and the moment their eyes fall upon it in printthey see a vision of glorious colors clothed in fire.
These describers are writing for the "general," and so, in order to makesure of being understood, they ought to use words in their ordinarysense, or else explain.  The word fountain means one thing in Syria,where there is but a handful of people; it means quite another thing inNorth America, where there are 75,000,000.  If I were describing someSyrian scenery, and should exclaim, "Within the narrow space of a quarterof a mile square I saw, in the glory of the flooding moonlight, twohundred noble fountains--imagine the spectacle!" the North American wouldhave a vision of clustering columns of water soaring aloft, bending overin graceful arches, bursting in beaded spray and raining white fire inthe moonlight-and he would be deceived.  But the Syrian would not bedeceived; he would merely see two hundred fresh-water springs--twohundred drowsing puddles, as level and unpretentious and unexcited as somany door-mats, and even with the help of the moonlight he would not losehis grip in the presence of the exhibition.  My word "fountain" would becorrect; it would speak the strict truth; and it would convey the stricttruth to the handful of Syrians, and the strictest misinformation to theNorth American millions.  With their gems--and gems--and more gems--andgems again--and still other gems--the describers of the Taj are withintheir legal but not their moral rights; they are dealing in the strictestscientific truth; and in doing it they succeed to admiration in telling"what ain't so."
