These chapters are for children, and I shall try to make thewords large enough to command respect. In the hope that you arelistening, and that you have confidence in me, I will proceed.Dates are difficult things to acquire; and after they areacquired it is difficult to keep them in the head. But they arevery valuable. They are like the cattle-pens of a ranch--theyshut in the several brands of historical cattle, each within itsown fence, and keep them from getting mixed together. Dates arehard to remember because they consist of figures; figures aremonotonously unstriking in appearance, and they don't take hold,they form no pictures, and so they give the eye no chance tohelp. Pictures are the thing. Pictures can make dates stick.They can make nearly anything stick--particularly IF YOU MAKE THEPICTURES YOURSELF. Indeed, that is the great point--make thepictures YOURSELF. I know about this from experience. Thirtyyears ago I was delivering a memorized lecture every night, andevery night I had to help myself with a page of notes to keepfrom getting myself mixed. The notes consisted of beginnings ofsentences, and were eleven in number, and they ran something likethis:"IN THAT REGION THE WEATHER--""AT THAT TIME IT WAS A CUSTOM--""BUT IN CALIFORNIA ONE NEVER HEARD--"Eleven of them. They initialed the brief divisions of thelecture and protected me against skipping. But they all lookedabout alike on the page; they formed no picture; I had them byheart, but I could never with certainty remember the order oftheir succession; therefore I always had to keep those notes byme and look at them every little while. Once I mislaid them; youwill not be able to imagine the terrors of that evening. I nowsaw that I must invent some other protection. So I got ten ofthe initial letters by heart in their proper order--I, A, B, andso on--and I went on the platform the next night with thesemarked in ink on my ten finger-nails. But it didn't answer. Ikept track of the figures for a while; then I lost it, and afterthat I was never quite sure which finger I had used last. Icouldn't lick off a letter after using it, for while that wouldhave made success certain it also would have provoked too muchcuriosity. There was curiosity enough without that. To theaudience I seemed more interested in my fingernails than I was inmy subject; one or two persons asked me afterward what was thematter with my hands.It was now that the idea of pictures occurred to me; then mytroubles passed away. In two minutes I made six pictures with apen, and they did the work of the eleven catch-sentences, and didit perfectly. I threw the pictures away as soon as they weremade, for I was sure I could shut my eyes and see them any time.That was a quarter of a century ago; the lecture vanished out ofmy head more than twenty years ago, but I would rewrite it fromthe pictures--for they remain. Here are three of them: (Fig. 1).The first one is a haystack--below it a rattlesnake--and ittold me where to begin to talk ranch-life in Carson Valley. Thesecond one told me where to begin the talk about a strange andviolent wind that used to burst upon Carson City from the SierraNevadas every afternoon at two o'clock and try to blow the townaway. The third picture, as you easily perceive, is lightning;its duty was to remind me when it was time to begin to talk aboutSan Francisco weather, where there IS no lightning--nor thunder,either--and it never failed me.I will give you a valuable hint. When a man is making aspeech and you are to follow him don't jot down notes to speakfrom, jot down PICTURES. It is awkward and embarrassing to haveto keep referring to notes; and besides it breaks up your speechand makes it ragged and non-coherent; but you can tear up yourpictures as soon as you have made them--they will stay fresh andstrong in your memory in the order and sequence in which youscratched them down. And many will admire to see what a goodmemory you are furnished with, when perhaps your memory is notany better than mine.Sixteen years ago when my children were little creatures thegoverness was trying to hammer some primer histories into theirheads. Part of this fun--if you like to call it that--consistedin the memorizing of the accession dates of the thirty-sevenpersonages who had ruled England from the Conqueror down. Theselittle people found it a bitter, hard contract. It was alldates, and all looked alike, and they wouldn't stick. Day afterday of the summer vacation dribbled by, and still the kings heldthe fort; the children couldn't conquer any six of them.With my lecture experience in mind I was aware that I couldinvent some way out of the trouble with pictures, but I hoped away could be found which would let them romp in the open airwhile they learned the kings. I found it, and they masteredall the monarchs in a day or two.The idea was to make them SEE the reigns with their eyes;that would be a large help. We were at the farm then. From thehouse-porch the grounds sloped gradually down to the lower fenceand rose on the right to the high ground where my small work-denstood. A carriage-road wound through the grounds and up thehill. I staked it out with the English monarchs, beginning withthe Conqueror, and you could stand on the porch and clearly seeevery reign and its length, from the Conquest down to Victoria,then in the forty-sixth year of her reign--EIGHT HUNDRED ANDSEVENTEEN YEARS OF English history under your eye at once!English history was an unusually live topic in America justthen. The world had suddenly realized that while it was notnoticing the Queen had passed Henry VIII., passed Henry VI. andElizabeth, and gaining in length every day. Her reign hadentered the list of the long ones; everybody was interested now--it was watching a race. Would she pass the long Edward? Therewas a possibility of it. Would she pass the long Henry?Doubtful, most people said. The long George? Impossible!Everybody said it. But we have lived to see her leave him twoyears behind.I measured off 817 feet of the roadway, a foot representinga year, and at the beginning and end of each reign I drove athree-foot white-pine stake in the turf by the roadside and wrotethe name and dates on it. Abreast the middle of the porch-frontstood a great granite flower-vase overflowing with a cataract ofbright-yellow flowers--I can't think of their name. The vase ofWilliam the Conqueror. We put his name on it and his accessiondate, 1066. We started from that and measured off twenty-onefeet of the road, and drove William Rufus's state; then thirteenfeet and drove the first Henry's stake; then thirty-five feet anddrove Stephen's; then nineteen feet, which brought us just pastthe summer-house on the left; then we staked out thirty-five,ten, and seventeen for the second Henry and Richard and John;turned the curve and entered upon just what was needed for HenryIII.--a level, straight stretch of fifty-six feet of road withouta crinkle in it. And it lay exactly in front of the house, inthe middle of the grounds. There couldn't have been a betterplace for that long reign; you could stand on the porch and seethose two wide-apart stakes almost with your eyes shut. (Fig. 2.)That isn't the shape of the road--I have bunched it up likethat to save room. The road had some great curves in it, buttheir gradual sweep was such that they were no mar to history.No, in our road one could tell at a glance who was who by the sizeof the vacancy between stakes--with LOCALITY to help, of course.Although I am away off here in a Swedish village [1] andthose stakes did not stand till the snow came, I can see themtoday as plainly as ever; and whenever I think of an Englishmonarch his stakes rise before me of their own accord and Inotice the large or small space which he takes up on our road.Are your kings spaced off in your mind? When you think ofRichard III. and of James II. do the durations of their reignsseem about alike to you? It isn't so to me; I always notice thatthere's a foot's difference. When you think of Henry III. do yousee a great long stretch of straight road? I do; and just at theend where it joins on to Edward I. I always see a small pear-bushwith its green fruit hanging down. When I think of theCommonwealth I see a shady little group of these small saplingswhich we called the oak parlor; when I think of George III. I seehim stretching up the hill, part of him occupied by a flight ofstone steps; and I can locate Stephen to an inch when he comesinto my mind, for he just filled the stretch which went by thesummer-house. Victoria's reign reached almost to my study dooron the first little summit; there's sixteen feet to be added now;I believe that that would carry it to a big pine-tree that wasshattered by some lightning one summer when it was trying to hit me.We got a good deal of fun out of the history road; andexercise, too. We trotted the course from the conqueror to thestudy, the children calling out the names, dates, and length ofreigns as we passed the stakes, going a good gait along the longreigns, but slowing down when we came upon people like Mary andEdward VI., and the short Stuart and Plantagenet, to give time toget in the statistics. I offered prizes, too--apples. I threwone as far as I could send it, and the child that first shoutedthe reign it fell in got the apple.The children were encouraged to stop locating things asbeing "over by the arbor," or "in the oak parlor," or "up at thestone steps," and say instead that the things were in Stephen, orin the Commonwealth, or in George III. They got the habitwithout trouble. To have the long road mapped out with suchexactness was a great boon for me, for I had the habit of leavingbooks and other articles lying around everywhere, and had notpreviously been able to definitely name the place, and so hadoften been obliged to go to fetch them myself, to save time andfailure; but now I could name the reign I left them in, and sendthe children.Next I thought I would measure off the French reigns, andpeg them alongside the English ones, so that we could always havecontemporaneous French history under our eyes as we went ourEnglish rounds. We pegged them down to the Hundred Years' War,then threw the idea aside, I do not now remember why. After thatwe made the English pegs fence in European and American historyas well as English, and that answered very well. English andalien poets, statesmen, artists, heroes, battles, plagues,cataclysms, revolutions--we shoveled them all into the Englishfences according to their dates. Do you understand? We gaveWashington's birth to George II.'s pegs and his death to GeorgeIII.'s; George II. got the Lisbon earthquake and George III. theDeclaration of Independence. Goethe, Shakespeare, Napoleon,Savonarola, Joan of Arc, the French Revolution, the Edict ofNantes, Clive, Wellington, Waterloo, Plassey, Patay, Cowpens,Saratoga, the Battle of the Boyne, the invention of thelogarithms, the microscope, the steam-engine, the telegraph--anything and everything all over the world--we dumped it allin among the English pegs according to it date and regardlessof its nationality.If the road-pegging scheme had not succeeded I should havelodged the kings in the children's heads by means of pictures--that is, I should have tried. It might have failed, for thepictures could only be effective WHEN MADE BY THE PUPIL; not themaster, for it is the work put upon the drawing that makes thedrawing stay in the memory, and my children were too little to makedrawings at that time. And, besides, they had no talent for art,which is strange, for in other ways they are like me.But I will develop the picture plan now, hoping that you willbe able to use it. It will come good for indoors when theweather is bad and one cannot go outside and peg a road. Let usimagine that the kings are a procession, and that they have comeout of the Ark and down Ararat for exercise and are now startingback again up the zigzag road. This will bring several of theminto view at once, and each zigzag will represent the length ofa king's reign.And so on. You will have plenty of space, for by my projectyou will use the parlor wall. You do not mark on the wall; thatwould cause trouble. You only attach bits of paper to it withpins or thumb-tacks. These will leave no mark.Take your pen now, and twenty-one pieces of white paper,each two inches square, and we will do the twenty-one years ofthe Conqueror's reign. On each square draw a picture of a whaleand write the dates and term of service. We choose the whale forseveral reasons: its name and William's begin with the sameletter; it is the biggest fish that swims, and William is themost conspicuous figure in English history in the way of alandmark; finally, a whale is about the easiest thing to draw.By the time you have drawn twenty-one wales and written "WilliamI.--1066-1087--twenty-one years" twenty-one times, those detailswill be your property; you cannot dislodge them from your memorywith anything but dynamite. I will make a sample for you to copy:(Fig. 3).I have got his chin up too high, but that is no matter; heis looking for Harold. It may be that a whale hasn't that fin upthere on his back, but I do not remember; and so, since there isa doubt, it is best to err on the safe side. He looks better,anyway, than he would without it.Be very careful and ATTENTIVE while you are drawing yourfirst whale from my sample and writing the word and figures underit, so that you will not need to copy the sample any more.Compare your copy with the sample; examine closely; if you findyou have got everything right and can shut your eyes and see thepicture and call the words and figures, then turn the sample andcopy upside down and make the next copy from memory; and also thenext and next, and so on, always drawing and writing from memoryuntil you have finished the whole twenty-one. This will take youtwenty minutes, or thirty, and by that time you will find thatyou can make a whale in less time than an unpracticed person canmake a sardine; also, up to the time you die you will always beable to furnish William's dates to any ignorant person thatinquires after them.You will now take thirteen pieces of BLUE paper, each twoinches square, and do William II. (Fig. 4.)Make him spout his water forward instead of backward; alsomake him small, and stick a harpoon in him and give him that sicklook in the eye. Otherwise you might seem to be continuing theother William, and that would be confusing and a damage. It isquite right to make him small; he was only about a No. 11 whale,or along there somewhere; there wasn't room in him for hisfather's great spirit. The barb of that harpoon ought not toshow like that, because it is down inside the whale and ought tobe out of sight, but it cannot be helped; if the barb wereremoved people would think some one had stuck a whip-stock intothe whale. It is best to leave the barb the way it is, thenevery one will know it is a harpoon and attending to business.Remember--draw from the copy only once; make your other twelveand the inscription from memory.Now the truth is that whenever you have copied a picture andits inscription once from my sample and two or three times frommemory the details will stay with you and be hard to forget.After that, if you like, you may make merely the whale's HEAD andWATER-SPOUT for the Conqueror till you end his reign, each timeSAYING the inscription in place of writing it; and in the case ofWilliam II. make the HARPOON alone, and say over the inscriptioneach time you do it. You see, it will take nearly twice as longto do the first set as it will to do the second, and that willgive you a marked sense of the difference in length of the two reigns.Next do Henry I. on thirty-five squares of RED paper.(Fig. 5.)That is a hen, and suggests Henry by furnishing the first syllable.When you have repeated the hen and the inscription until you areperfectly sure of them, draw merely the hen's head the rest of thethirty-five times, saying over the inscription each time. Thus:(Fig. 6).You begin to understand how how this procession is going tolook when it is on the wall. First there will be the Conqueror'stwenty-one whales and water-spouts, the twenty-one white squaresjoined to one another and making a white stripe three and one-half feet long; the thirteen blue squares of William II. will bejoined to that--a blue stripe two feet, two inches long, followedby Henry's red stripe five feet, ten inches long, and so on. Thecolored divisions will smartly show to the eye the difference inthe length of the reigns and impress the proportions on thememory and the understanding. (Fig. 7.)Stephen of Blois comes next. He requires nineteen two-inchsquares of YELLOW paper. (Fig. 8.)That is a steer. The sound suggests the beginning ofStephen's name. I choose it for that reason. I can make abetter steer than that when I am not excited. But this one willdo. It is a good-enough steer for history. The tail isdefective, but it only wants straightening out.Next comes Henry II. Give him thirty-five squares of RED paper.These hens must face west, like the former ones. (Fig. 9.)This hen differs from the other one. He is on his way toinquire what has been happening in Canterbury.How we arrive at Richard I., called Richard of the Lion-heart because he was a brave fighter and was never so contentedas when he was leading crusades in Palestine and neglecting hisaffairs at home. Give him ten squares of WHITE paper. (Fig. 10).That is a lion. His office is to remind you of the lion-hearted Richard. There is something the matter with his legs,but I do not quite know what it is, they do not seem right.I think the hind ones are the most unsatisfactory; the frontones are well enough, though it would be better if they wererights and lefts.Next comes King John, and he was a poor circumstance.He was called Lackland. He gave his realm to the Pope.Let him have seventeen squares of YELLOW paper. (Fig. 11.)That creature is a jamboree. It looks like a trademark, butthat is only an accident and not intentional. It is prehistoricand extinct. It used to roam the earth in the Old Siluriantimes, and lay eggs and catch fish and climb trees and live onfossils; for it was of a mixed breed, which was the fashion then.It was very fierce, and the Old Silurians were afraid of it, butthis is a tame one. Physically it has no representative now, butits mind has been transmitted. First I drew it sitting down, buthave turned it the other way now because I think it looks moreattractive and spirited when one end of it is galloping. I loveto think that in this attitude it gives us a pleasant idea ofJohn coming all in a happy excitement to see what the barons havebeen arranging for him at Runnymede, while the other one gives usan idea of him sitting down to wring his hands and grieve over it.We now come to Henry III.; RED squares again, of course--fifty-six of them. We must make all the Henrys the same color;it will make their long reigns show up handsomely on the wall.Among all the eight Henrys there were but two short ones. Alucky name, as far as longevity goes. The reigns of six of theHenrys cover 227 years. It might have been well to name all theroyal princes Henry, but this was overlooked until it was too late.(Fig. 12.)This is the best one yet. He is on his way (1265) to have alook at the first House of Commons in English history. It was amonumental event, the situation in the House, and was the secondgreat liberty landmark which the century had set up. I have madeHenry looking glad, but this was not intentional.Edward I. comes next; LIGHT-BROWN paper, thirty-five squares.(Fig. 13.)That is an editor. He is trying to think of a word. Heprops his feet on a chair, which is the editor's way; then he canthink better. I do not care much for this one; his ears are notalike; still, editor suggests the sound of Edward, and he willdo. I could make him better if I had a model, but I made thisone from memory. But is no particular matter; they all lookalike, anyway. They are conceited and troublesome, and don't payenough. Edward was the first really English king that had yetoccupied the throne. The editor in the picture probably looksjust as Edward looked when it was first borne in upon him thatthis was so. His whole attitude expressed gratification andpride mixed with stupefaction and astonishment.Edward II. now; twenty BLUE squares. (Fig. 14.)Another editor. That thing behind his ear is his pencil.Whenever he finds a bright thing in your manuscript he strikes itout with that. That does him good, and makes him smile and showhis teeth, the way he is doing in the picture. This one has justbeen striking out a smart thing, and now he is sitting there withhis thumbs in his vest-holes, gloating. They are full of envyand malice, editors are. This picture will serve to remind youthat Edward II. was the first English king who was DEPOSED. Upondemand, he signed his deposition himself. He had found kingshipa most aggravating and disagreeable occupation, and you can seeby the look of him that he is glad he resigned. He has put hisblue pencil up for good now. He had struck out many a good thingwith it in his time.Edward III. next; fifty RED squares. (Fig. 15.)This editor is a critic. He has pulled out his carving-knife and his tomahawk and is starting after a book which he isgoing to have for breakfast. This one's arms are put on wrong.I did not notice it at first, but I see it now. Somehow he hasgot his right arm on his left shoulder, and his left arm on hisright shoulder, and this shows us the back of his hands in bothinstances. It makes him left-handed all around, which is a thingwhich has never happened before, except perhaps in a museum.That is the way with art, when it is not acquired but born toyou: you start in to make some simple little thing, notsuspecting that your genius is beginning to work and swell andstrain in secret, and all of a sudden there is a convulsion andyou fetch out something astonishing. This is called inspiration.It is an accident; you never know when it is coming. I mighthave tried as much as a year to think of such a strange thing asan all-around left-handed man and I could not have done it, forthe more you try to think of an unthinkable thing the more iteludes you; but it can't elude inspiration; you have only to baitwith inspiration and you will get it every time. Look atBotticelli's "Spring." Those snaky women were unthinkable, butinspiration secured them for us, thanks to goodness. It is toolate to reorganize this editor-critic now; we will leave him ashe is. He will serve to remind us.Richard II. next; twenty-two WHITE squares. (Fig. 16.)We use the lion again because this is another Richard. LikeEdward II., he was DEPOSED. He is taking a last sad look at hiscrown before they take it away. There was not room enough and Ihave made it too small; but it never fitted him, anyway.Now we turn the corner of the century with a new line ofmonarchs--the Lancastrian kings.Henry IV.; fourteen squares of YELLOW paper. (Fig. 17.)This hen has laid the egg of a new dynasty and realizes themagnitude of the event. She is giving notice in the usual way.You notice I am improving in the construction of hens. At firstI made them too much like other animals, but this one isorthodox. I mention this to encourage you. You will find thatthe more you practice the more accurate you will become. I couldalways draw animals, but before I was educated I could not tellwhat kind they were when I got them done, but now I can. Keep upyour courage; it will be the same with you, although you may notthink it. This Henry died the year after Joan of Arc was born.Henry V.; nine BLUE squares. (Fig. 18)There you see him lost in meditation over the monument whichrecords the amazing figures of the battle of Agincourt. Frenchhistory says 20,000 Englishmen routed 80,000 Frenchmen there; andEnglish historians say that the French loss, in killed andwounded, was 60,000.Henry VI.; thirty-nine RED squares. (Fig. 19)This is poor Henry VI., who reigned long and scored manymisfortunes and humiliations. Also two great disasters: he lostFrance to Joan of Arc and he lost the throne and ended thedynasty which Henry IV. had started in business with such goodprospects. In the picture we see him sad and weary and downcast,with the scepter falling from his nerveless grasp. It is apathetic quenching of a sun which had risen in such splendor.Edward IV.; twenty-two LIGHT-BROWN squares. (Fig. 20.)That is a society editor, sitting there elegantly dressed,with his legs crossed in that indolent way, observing the clothesthe ladies wear, so that he can describe them for his paper andmake them out finer than they are and get bribes for it andbecome wealthy. That flower which he is wearing in hisbuttonhole is a rose--a white rose, a York rose--and will serveto remind us of the War of the Roses, and that the white one wasthe winning color when Edward got the throne and dispossessed theLancastrian dynasty.Edward V.; one-third of a BLACK square. (Fig. 21.)His uncle Richard had him murdered in the tower. When youget the reigns displayed upon the wall this one will beconspicuous and easily remembered. It is the shortest one inEnglish history except Lady Jane Grey's, which was only ninedays. She is never officially recognized as a monarch ofEngland, but if you or I should ever occupy a throne we shouldlike to have proper notice taken of it; and it would be only fairand right, too, particularly if we gained nothing by it and lostour lives besides.Richard III.; two WHITE squares. (Fig. 22.)That is not a very good lion, but Richard was not a verygood king. You would think that this lion has two heads, butthat is not so; one is only a shadow. There would be shadows forthe rest of him, but there was not light enough to go round, itbeing a dull day, with only fleeting sun-glimpses now and then.Richard had a humped back and a hard heart, and fell at thebattle of Bosworth. I do not know the name of that flower in thepot, but we will use it as Richard's trade-mark, for it is saidthat it grows in only one place in the world--Bosworth Field--andtradition says it never grew there until Richard's royal bloodwarmed its hidden seed to life and made it grow.Henry VII.; twenty-four BLUE squares. (Fig. 23.)Henry VII. had no liking for wars and turbulence; hepreferred peace and quiet and the general prosperity which suchconditions create. He liked to sit on that kind of eggs on hisown private account as well as the nation's, and hatch them outand count up their result. When he died he left his heir2,000,000 pounds, which was a most unusual fortune for a king topossess in those days. Columbus's great achievement gave him thediscovery-fever, and he sent Sebastian Cabot to the New World tosearch out some foreign territory for England. That is Cabot'sship up there in the corner. This was the first time thatEngland went far abroad to enlarge her estate--but not the last.Henry VIII.; thirty-eight RED squares. (Fig. 24.)That is Henry VIII. suppressing a monastery in his arrogant fashion.Edward VI.; six squares of YELLOW paper. (Fig. 25.)He is the last Edward to date. It is indicated by thatthing over his head, which is a LAST--shoemaker's last.Mary; five squares of BLACK paper. (Fig. 26.)The picture represents a burning martyr. He is in back ofthe smoke. The first three letters of Mary's name and the firstthree of the word martyr are the same. Martyrdom was going outin her day and martyrs were becoming scarcer, but she madeseveral. For this reason she is sometimes called Bloody Mary.This brings us to the reign of Elizabeth, after passingthrough a period of nearly five hundred years of England'shistory--492 to be exact. I think you may now be trusted to gothe rest of the way without further lessons in art orinspirations in the matter of ideas. You have the scheme now,and something in the ruler's name or career will suggest thepictorial symbol. The effort of inventing such things will notonly help your memory, but will develop originality in art. Seewhat it has done for me. If you do not find the parlor wall bigenough for all of England's history, continue it into the dining-room and into other rooms. This will make the walls interestingand instructive and really worth something instead of being justflat things to hold the house together.-----1. Summer of 1899.
