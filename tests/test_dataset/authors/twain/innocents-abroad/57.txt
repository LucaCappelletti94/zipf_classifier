It was worth a kingdom to be at sea again. It was a relief to drop allanxiety whatsoever--all questions as to where we should go; how long weshould stay; whether it were worth while to go or not; all anxietiesabout the condition of the horses; all such questions as "Shall we everget to water?" "Shall we ever lunch?" "Ferguson, how many more millionmiles have we got to creep under this awful sun before we camp?" It wasa relief to cast all these torturing little anxieties far away--ropes ofsteel they were, and every one with a separate and distinct strain on it--and feel the temporary contentment that is born of the banishment ofall care and responsibility. We did not look at the compass: we did notcare, now, where the ship went to, so that she went out of sight of landas quickly as possible. When I travel again, I wish to go in a pleasureship. No amount of money could have purchased for us, in a strangevessel and among unfamiliar faces, the perfect satisfaction and the senseof being at home again which we experienced when we stepped on board the"Quaker City,"--our own ship--after this wearisome pilgrimage. It is asomething we have felt always when we returned to her, and a something wehad no desire to sell.
We took off our blue woollen shirts, our spurs, and heavy boots, oursanguinary revolvers and our buckskin-seated pantaloons, and got shavedand came out in Christian costume once more. All but Jack, who changedall other articles of his dress, but clung to his traveling pantaloons.They still preserved their ample buckskin seat intact; and so his shortpea jacket and his long, thin legs assisted to make him a picturesqueobject whenever he stood on the forecastle looking abroad upon the oceanover the bows. At such times his father's last injunction suggesteditself to me. He said:
"Jack, my boy, you are about to go among a brilliant company of gentlemenand ladies, who are refined and cultivated, and thoroughly accomplishedin the manners and customs of good society. Listen to theirconversation, study their habits of life, and learn. Be polite andobliging to all, and considerate towards every one's opinions, failingsand prejudices. Command the just respect of all your fellow-voyagers,even though you fail to win their friendly regard. And Jack--don't youever dare, while you live, appear in public on those decks in fairweather, in a costume unbecoming your mother's drawing-room!"
It would have been worth any price if the father of this hopeful youthcould have stepped on board some time, and seen him standing high on thefore-castle, pea jacket, tasseled red fez, buckskin patch and all,placidly contemplating the ocean--a rare spectacle for any body'sdrawing-room.
After a pleasant voyage and a good rest, we drew near to Egypt and out ofthe mellowest of sunsets we saw the domes and minarets of Alexandria riseinto view. As soon as the anchor was down, Jack and I got a boat andwent ashore. It was night by this time, and the other passengers werecontent to remain at home and visit ancient Egypt after breakfast. Itwas the way they did at Constantinople. They took a lively interest innew countries, but their school-boy impatience had worn off, and they hadlearned that it was wisdom to take things easy and go along comfortably--these old countries do not go away in the night; they stay till afterbreakfast.
When we reached the pier we found an army of Egyptian boys with donkeysno larger than themselves, waiting for passengers--for donkeys are theomnibuses of Egypt. We preferred to walk, but we could not have our ownway. The boys crowded about us, clamored around us, and slewed theirdonkeys exactly across our path, no matter which way we turned. Theywere good-natured rascals, and so were the donkeys. We mounted, and theboys ran behind us and kept the donkeys in a furious gallop, as is thefashion at Damascus. I believe I would rather ride a donkey than anybeast in the world. He goes briskly, he puts on no airs, he is docile,though opinionated. Satan himself could not scare him, and he isconvenient--very convenient. When you are tired riding you can rest yourfeet on the ground and let him gallop from under you.
We found the hotel and secured rooms, and were happy to know that thePrince of Wales had stopped there once. They had it every where onsigns. No other princes had stopped there since, till Jack and I came.We went abroad through the town, then, and found it a city of hugecommercial buildings, and broad, handsome streets brilliant withgas-light. By night it was a sort of reminiscence of Paris. But finallyJack found an ice-cream saloon, and that closed investigations for thatevening. The weather was very hot, it had been many a day since Jack hadseen ice-cream, and so it was useless to talk of leaving the saloon tillit shut up.
In the morning the lost tribes of America came ashore and infested thehotels and took possession of all the donkeys and other open barouchesthat offered. They went in picturesque procession to the AmericanConsul's; to the great gardens; to Cleopatra's Needles; to Pompey'sPillar; to the palace of the Viceroy of Egypt; to the Nile; to the superbgroves of date-palms. One of our most inveterate relic-hunters had hishammer with him, and tried to break a fragment off the upright Needle andcould not do it; he tried the prostrate one and failed; he borrowed aheavy sledge hammer from a mason and tried again. He tried Pompey'sPillar, and this baffled him. Scattered all about the mighty monolithwere sphinxes of noble countenance, carved out of Egyptian granite ashard as blue steel, and whose shapely features the wear of five thousandyears had failed to mark or mar. The relic-hunter battered at thesepersistently, and sweated profusely over his work. He might as well haveattempted to deface the moon. They regarded him serenely with thestately smile they had worn so long, and which seemed to say, "Peck away,poor insect; we were not made to fear such as you; in ten-score draggingages we have seen more of your kind than there are sands at your feet:have they left a blemish upon us?"
But I am forgetting the Jaffa Colonists. At Jaffa we had taken on boardsome forty members of a very celebrated community. They were male andfemale; babies, young boys and young girls; young married people, andsome who had passed a shade beyond the prime of life. I refer to the"Adams Jaffa Colony." Others had deserted before. We left in Jaffa Mr.Adams, his wife, and fifteen unfortunates who not only had no money butdid not know where to turn or whither to go. Such was the statement madeto us. Our forty were miserable enough in the first place, and they layabout the decks seasick all the voyage, which about completed theirmisery, I take it. However, one or two young men remained upright, andby constant persecution we wormed out of them some little information.They gave it reluctantly and in a very fragmentary condition, for, havingbeen shamefully humbugged by their prophet, they felt humiliated andunhappy. In such circumstances people do not like to talk.
The colony was a complete fiasco. I have already said that such as couldget away did so, from time to time. The prophet Adams--once an actor,then several other things, afterward a Mormon and a missionary, always anadventurer--remains at Jaffa with his handful of sorrowful subjects. Theforty we brought away with us were chiefly destitute, though not all ofthem. They wished to get to Egypt. What might become of them then theydid not know and probably did not care--any thing to get away from hatedJaffa. They had little to hope for. Because after many appeals to thesympathies of New England, made by strangers of Boston, through thenewspapers, and after the establishment of an office there for thereception of moneyed contributions for the Jaffa colonists, One Dollarwas subscribed. The consul-general for Egypt showed me the newspaperparagraph which mentioned the circumstance and mentioned also thediscontinuance of the effort and the closing of the office. It wasevident that practical New England was not sorry to be rid of suchvisionaries and was not in the least inclined to hire any body to bringthem back to her. Still, to get to Egypt, was something, in the eyes ofthe unfortunate colonists, hopeless as the prospect seemed of evergetting further.
Thus circumstanced, they landed at Alexandria from our ship. One of ourpassengers, Mr. Moses S. Beach, of the New York Sun, inquired of theconsul-general what it would cost to send these people to their home inMaine by the way of Liverpool, and he said fifteen hundred dollars ingold would do it. Mr. Beach gave his check for the money and so thetroubles of the Jaffa colonists were at an end.--[It was an unselfishact of benevolence; it was done without any ostentation, and has neverbeen mentioned in any newspaper, I think. Therefore it is refreshing tolearn now, several months after the above narrative was written, thatanother man received all the credit of this rescue of the colonists.Such is life.]
Alexandria was too much like a European city to be novel, and we soontired of it. We took the cars and came up here to ancient Cairo, whichis an Oriental city and of the completest pattern. There is little aboutit to disabuse one's mind of the error if he should take it into his headthat he was in the heart of Arabia. Stately camels and dromedaries,swarthy Egyptians, and likewise Turks and black Ethiopians, turbaned,sashed, and blazing in a rich variety of Oriental costumes of all shadesof flashy colors, are what one sees on every hand crowding the narrowstreets and the honeycombed bazaars. We are stopping at Shepherd'sHotel, which is the worst on earth except the one I stopped at once in asmall town in the United States. It is pleasant to read this sketch inmy note-book, now, and know that I can stand Shepherd's Hotel, sure,because I have been in one just like it in America and survived: 
     I stopped at the Benton House.  It used to be a good hotel, but that     proves nothing--I used to be a good boy, for that matter.  Both of     us have lost character of late years.  The Benton is not a good     hotel.  The Benton lacks a very great deal of being a good hotel.     Perdition is full of better hotels than the Benton.
     It was late at night when I got there, and I told the clerk I would     like plenty of lights, because I wanted to read an hour or two.     When I reached No. 15 with the porter (we came along a dim hall that     was clad in ancient carpeting, faded, worn out in many places, and     patched with old scraps of oil cloth--a hall that sank under one's     feet, and creaked dismally to every footstep,) he struck a light     --two inches of sallow, sorrowful, consumptive tallow candle, that     burned blue, and sputtered, and got discouraged and went out.  The     porter lit it again, and I asked if that was all the light the clerk     sent.  He said, "Oh no, I've got another one here," and he produced     another couple of inches of tallow candle.  I said, "Light them both     --I'll have to have one to see the other by."  He did it, but the     result was drearier than darkness itself.  He was a cheery,     accommodating rascal.  He said he would go "somewheres" and steal a     lamp.  I abetted and encouraged him in his criminal design.  I heard     the landlord get after him in the hall ten minutes afterward.
     "Where are you going with that lamp?"
     "Fifteen wants it, sir."
     "Fifteen! why he's got a double lot of candles--does the man want     to illuminate the house?--does he want to get up a torch-light     procession?--what is he up to, any how?"
     "He don't like them candles--says he wants a lamp."
     "Why what in the nation does----why I never heard of such a thing?     What on earth can he want with that lamp?"
     "Well, he only wants to read--that's what he says."
     "Wants to read, does he?--ain't satisfied with a thousand candles,     but has to have a lamp!--I do wonder what the devil that fellow     wants that lamp for?  Take him another candle, and then if----"
     "But he wants the lamp--says he'll burn the d--d old house down if     he don't get a lamp!" (a remark which I never made.)
     "I'd like to see him at it once.  Well, you take it along--but I     swear it beats my time, though--and see if you can't find out what     in the very nation he wants with that lamp."
     And he went off growling to himself and still wondering and     wondering over the unaccountable conduct of No. 15.  The lamp was a     good one, but it revealed some disagreeable things--a bed in the     suburbs of a desert of room--a bed that had hills and valleys in it,     and you'd have to accommodate your body to the impression left in it     by the man that slept there last, before you could lie comfortably;     a carpet that had seen better days; a melancholy washstand in a     remote corner, and a dejected pitcher on it sorrowing over a broken     nose; a looking-glass split across the centre, which chopped your     head off at the chin and made you look like some dreadful unfinished     monster or other; the paper peeling in shreds from the walls.
     I sighed and said: "This is charming; and now don't you think you     could get me something to read?"
     The porter said, "Oh, certainly; the old man's got dead loads of     books;" and he was gone before I could tell him what sort of     literature I would rather have.  And yet his countenance expressed     the utmost confidence in his ability to execute the commission with     credit to himself.  The old man made a descent on him.
     "What are you going to do with that pile of books?"
     "Fifteen wants 'em, sir."
     "Fifteen, is it?  He'll want a warming-pan, next--he'll want a     nurse!  Take him every thing there is in the house--take him the     bar-keeper--take him the baggage-wagon--take him a chamber-maid!     Confound me, I never saw any thing like it.  What did he say he     wants with those books?"
     "Wants to read 'em, like enough; it ain't likely he wants to eat     'em, I don't reckon."
     "Wants to read 'em--wants to read 'em this time of night, the     infernal lunatic!  Well, he can't have them."
     "But he says he's mor'ly bound to have 'em; he says he'll just go     a-rairin' and a-chargin' through this house and raise more--well,     there's no tellin' what he won't do if he don't get 'em; because     he's drunk and crazy and desperate, and nothing'll soothe him down     but them cussed books."  [I had not made any threats, and was not in     the condition ascribed to me by the porter.]
     "Well, go on; but I will be around when he goes to rairing and     charging, and the first rair he makes I'll make him rair out of the     window."  And then the old gentleman went off, growling as before.
     The genius of that porter was something wonderful.  He put an armful     of books on the bed and said "Good night" as confidently as if he     knew perfectly well that those books were exactly my style of     reading matter.  And well he might.  His selection covered the whole     range of legitimate literature.  It comprised "The Great     Consummation," by Rev. Dr. Cummings--theology; "Revised Statutes of     the State of Missouri"--law; "The Complete Horse-Doctor"--medicine;     "The Toilers of the Sea," by Victor Hugo--romance; "The works of     William Shakspeare"--poetry.  I shall never cease to admire the tact     and the intelligence of that gifted porter.
But all the donkeys in Christendom, and most of the Egyptian boys, Ithink, are at the door, and there is some noise going on, not to put itin stronger language.--We are about starting to the illustrious Pyramidsof Egypt, and the donkeys for the voyage are under inspection.  I will goand select one before the choice animals are all taken.
