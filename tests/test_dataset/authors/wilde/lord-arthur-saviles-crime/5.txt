Mr. Merton was a good deal distressed at the second postponement ofthe marriage, and Lady Julia, who had already ordered her dress forthe wedding, did all in her power to make Sybil break off the match.Dearly, however, as Sybil loved her mother, she had given her wholelife into Lord Arthur's hands, and nothing that Lady Julia could saycould make her waver in her faith. As for Lord Arthur himself, ittook him days to get over his terrible disappointment, and for atime his nerves were completely unstrung. His excellent commonsense, however, soon asserted itself, and his sound, practical minddid not leave him long in doubt about what to do. Poison havingproved a complete failure, dynamite, or some other form ofexplosive, was obviously the proper thing to try.
He accordingly looked again over the list of his friends andrelatives, and, after careful consideration, determined to blow uphis uncle, the Dean of Chichester. The Dean, who was a man of greatculture and learning, was extremely fond of clocks, and had awonderful collection of timepieces, ranging from the fifteenthcentury to the present day, and it seemed to Lord Arthur that thishobby of the good Dean's offered him an excellent opportunity forcarrying out his scheme. Where to procure an explosive machine was,of course, quite another matter. The London Directory gave him noinformation on the point, and he felt that there was very little usein going to Scotland Yard about it, as they never seemed to knowanything about the movements of the dynamite faction till after anexplosion had taken place, and not much even then.
Suddenly he thought of his friend Rouvaloff, a young Russian of veryrevolutionary tendencies, whom he had met at Lady Windermere's inthe winter. Count Rouvaloff was supposed to be writing a life ofPeter the Great, and to have come over to England for the purpose ofstudying the documents relating to that Tsar's residence in thiscountry as a ship carpenter; but it was generally suspected that hewas a Nihilist agent, and there was no doubt that the RussianEmbassy did not look with any favour upon his presence in London.Lord Arthur felt that he was just the man for his purpose, and drovedown one morning to his lodgings in Bloomsbury, to ask his adviceand assistance.
'So you are taking up politics seriously?' said Count Rouvaloff,when Lord Arthur had told him the object of his mission; but LordArthur, who hated swagger of any kind, felt bound to admit to himthat he had not the slightest interest in social questions, andsimply wanted the explosive machine for a purely family matter, inwhich no one was concerned but himself.
Count Rouvaloff looked at him for some moments in amazement, andthen seeing that he was quite serious, wrote an address on a pieceof paper, initialled it, and handed it to him across the table.
'Scotland Yard would give a good deal to know this address, my dearfellow.'
'They shan't have it,' cried Lord Arthur, laughing; and aftershaking the young Russian warmly by the hand he ran downstairs,examined the paper, and told the coachman to drive to Soho Square.
There he dismissed him, and strolled down Greek Street, till he cameto a place called Bayle's Court. He passed under the archway, andfound himself in a curious cul-de-sac, that was apparently occupiedby a French Laundry, as a perfect network of clothes-lines wasstretched across from house to house, and there was a flutter ofwhite linen in the morning air. He walked right to the end, andknocked at a little green house. After some delay, during whichevery window in the court became a blurred mass of peering faces,the door was opened by a rather rough-looking foreigner, who askedhim in very bad English what his business was. Lord Arthur handedhim the paper Count Rouvaloff had given him. When the man saw it hebowed, and invited Lord Arthur into a very shabby front parlour onthe ground floor, and in a few moments Herr Winckelkopf, as he wascalled in England, bustled into the room, with a very wine-stainednapkin round his neck, and a fork in his left hand.
'Count Rouvaloff has given me an introduction to you,' said LordArthur, bowing, 'and I am anxious to have a short interview with youon a matter of business. My name is Smith, Mr. Robert Smith, and Iwant you to supply me with an explosive clock.'
'Charmed to meet you, Lord Arthur,' said the genial little German,laughing. 'Don't look so alarmed, it is my duty to know everybody,and I remember seeing you one evening at Lady Windermere's. I hopeher ladyship is quite well. Do you mind sitting with me while Ifinish my breakfast? There is an excellent pate, and my friends arekind enough to say that my Rhine wine is better than any they get atthe German Embassy,' and before Lord Arthur had got over hissurprise at being recognised, he found himself seated in the back-room, sipping the most delicious Marcobrunner out of a pale yellowhock-glass marked with the Imperial monogram, and chatting in thefriendliest manner possible to the famous conspirator.
'Explosive clocks,' said Herr Winckelkopf, 'are not very good thingsfor foreign exportation, as, even if they succeed in passing theCustom House, the train service is so irregular, that they usuallygo off before they have reached their proper destination. If,however, you want one for home use, I can supply you with anexcellent article, and guarantee that you will he satisfied with theresult. May I ask for whom it is intended? If it is for thepolice, or for any one connected with Scotland Yard, I am afraid Icannot do anything for you. The English detectives are really ourbest friends, and I have always found that by relying on theirstupidity, we can do exactly what we like. I could not spare one ofthem.'
'I assure you,' said Lord Arthur, 'that it has nothing to do withthe police at all. In fact, the clock is intended for the Dean ofChichester.'
'Dear me! I had no idea that you felt so strongly about religion,Lord Arthur. Few young men do nowadays.'
'I am afraid you overrate me, Herr Winckelkopf,' said Lord Arthur,blushing. 'The fact is, I really know nothing about theology.'
'It is a purely private matter then?'
'Purely private.'
Herr Winckelkopf shrugged his shoulders, and left the room,returning in a few minutes with a round cake of dynamite about thesize of a penny, and a pretty little French clock, surmounted by anormolu figure of Liberty trampling on the hydra of Despotism.
Lord Arthur's face brightened up when he saw it. 'That is just whatI want,' he cried, 'and now tell me how it goes off.'
'Ah! there is my secret,' answered Herr Winckelkopf, contemplatinghis invention with a justifiable look of pride; 'let me know whenyou wish it to explode, and I will set the machine to the moment.'
'Well, to-day is Tuesday, and if you could send it off at once--'
'That is impossible; I have a great deal of important work on handfor some friends of mine in Moscow. Still, I might send it off to-morrow.'
'Oh, it will be quite time enough!' said Lord Arthur politely, 'ifit is delivered to-morrow night or Thursday morning. For the momentof the explosion, say Friday at noon exactly. The Dean is always athome at that hour.'
'Friday, at noon,' repeated Herr Winckelkopf, and he made a note tothat effect in a large ledger that was lying on a bureau near thefireplace.
'And now,' said Lord Arthur, rising from his seat, 'pray let me knowhow much I am in your debt.'
'It is such a small matter, Lord Arthur, that I do not care to makeany charge. The dynamite comes to seven and sixpence, the clockwill be three pounds ten, and the carriage about five shillings. Iam only too pleased to oblige any friend of Count Rouvaloff's.'
'But your trouble, Herr Winckelkopf?'
'Oh, that is nothing! It is a pleasure to me. I do not work formoney; I live entirely for my art.'
Lord Arthur laid down 4 pounds, 2s. 6d. on the table, thanked thelittle German for his kindness, and, having succeeded in decliningan invitation to meet some Anarchists at a meat-tea on the followingSaturday, left the house and went off to the Park.
For the next two days he was in a state of the greatest excitement,and on Friday at twelve o'clock he drove down to the Buckingham towait for news. All the afternoon the stolid hall-porter keptposting up telegrams from various parts of the country giving theresults of horse-races, the verdicts in divorce suits, the state ofthe weather, and the like, while the tape ticked out wearisomedetails about an all-night sitting in the House of Commons, and asmall panic on the Stock Exchange. At four o'clock the eveningpapers came in, and Lord Arthur disappeared into the library withthe Pall Mall, the St. James's, the Globe, and the Echo, to theimmense indignation of Colonel Goodchild, who wanted to read thereports of a speech he had delivered that morning at the MansionHouse, on the subject of South African Missions, and theadvisability of having black Bishops in every province, and for somereason or other had a strong prejudice against the Evening News.None of the papers, however, contained even the slightest allusionto Chichester, and Lord Arthur felt that the attempt must havefailed. It was a terrible blow to him, and for a time he was quiteunnerved. Herr Winckelkopf, whom he went to see the next day wasfull of elaborate apologies, and offered to supply him with anotherclock free of charge, or with a case of nitro-glycerine bombs atcost price. But he had lost all faith in explosives, and HerrWinckelkopf himself acknowledged that everything is so adulteratednowadays, that even dynamite can hardly be got in a pure condition.The little German, however, while admitting that something must havegone wrong with the machinery, was not without hope that the clockmight still go off, and instanced the case of a barometer that hehad once sent to the military Governor at Odessa, which, thoughtimed to explode in ten days, had not done so for something likethree months. It was quite true that when it did go off, it merelysucceeded in blowing a housemaid to atoms, the Governor having goneout of town six weeks before, but at least it showed that dynamite,as a destructive force, was, when under the control of machinery, apowerful, though a somewhat unpunctual agent. Lord Arthur was alittle consoled by this reflection, but even here he was destined todisappointment, for two days afterwards, as he was going upstairs,the Duchess called him into her boudoir, and showed him a letter shehad just received from the Deanery.
'Jane writes charming letters,' said the Duchess; 'you must reallyread her last. It is quite as good as the novels Mudie sends us.'
Lord Arthur seized the letter from her hand. It ran as follows:-
THE DEANERY, CHICHESTER,27th May.
My Dearest Aunt,
Thank you so much for the flannel for the Dorcas Society, and alsofor the gingham. I quite agree with you that it is nonsense theirwanting to wear pretty things, but everybody is so Radical andirreligious nowadays, that it is difficult to make them see thatthey should not try and dress like the upper classes. I am sure Idon't know what we are coming to. As papa has often said in hissermons, we live in an age of unbelief.
We have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papalast Thursday. It arrived in a wooden box from London, carriagepaid, and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had readhis remarkable sermon, 'Is Licence Liberty?' for on the top of theclock was a figure of a woman, with what papa said was the cap ofLiberty on her head. I didn't think it very becoming myself, butpapa said it was historical, so I suppose it is all right. Parkerunpacked it, and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library, andwe were all sitting there on Friday morning, when just as the clockstruck twelve, we heard a whirring noise, a little puff of smokecame from the pedestal of the figure, and the goddess of Libertyfell off, and broke her nose on the fender! Maria was quitealarmed, but it looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off intofits of laughter, and even papa was amused. When we examined it, wefound it was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to aparticular hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a littlehammer, it went off whenever you wanted. Papa said it must notremain in the library, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it awayto the schoolroom, and does nothing but have small explosions allday long. Do you think Arthur would like one for a wedding present?I suppose they are quite fashionable in London. Papa says theyshould do a great deal of good, as they show that Liberty can'tlast, but must fall down. Papa says Liberty was invented at thetime of the French Revolution. How awful it seems!
I have now to go to the Dorcas, where I will read them your mostinstructive letter. How true, dear aunt, your idea is, that intheir rank of life they should wear what is unbecoming. I must sayit is absurd, their anxiety about dress, when there are so many moreimportant things in this world, and in the next. I am so glad yourflowered poplin turned out so well, and that your lace was not torn.I am wearing my yellow satin, that you so kindly gave me, at theBishop's on Wednesday, and think it will look all right. Would youhave bows or not? Jennings says that every one wears bows now, andthat the underskirt should be frilled. Reggie has just had anotherexplosion, and papa has ordered the clock to be sent to the stables.I don't think papa likes it so much as he did at first, though he isvery flattered at being sent such a pretty and ingenious toy. Itshows that people read his sermons, and profit by them.
Papa sends his love, in which James, and Reggie, and Maria allunite, and, hoping that Uncle Cecil's gout is better, believe me,dear aunt, ever your affectionate niece,
JANE PERCY.
PS.--Do tell me about the bows. Jennings insists they are thefashion.
Lord Arthur looked so serious and unhappy over the letter, that theDuchess went into fits of laughter.
'My dear Arthur,' she cried, 'I shall never show you a young lady'sletter again! But what shall I say about the clock? I think it isa capital invention, and I should like to have one myself.'
'I don't think much of them,' said Lord Arthur, with a sad smile,and, after kissing his mother, he left the room.
When he got upstairs, he flung himself on a sofa, and his eyesfilled with tears. He had done his best to commit this murder, buton both occasions he had failed, and through no fault of his own.He had tried to do his duty, but it seemed as if Destiny herself hadturned traitor. He was oppressed with the sense of the barrennessof good intentions, of the futility of trying to be fine. Perhaps,it would be better to break off the marriage altogether. Sybilwould suffer, it is true, but suffering could not really mar anature so noble as hers. As for himself, what did it matter? Thereis always some war in which a man can die, some cause to which a mancan give his life, and as life had no pleasure for him, so death hadno terror. Let Destiny work out his doom. He would not stir tohelp her.
At half-past seven he dressed, and went down to the club. Surbitonwas there with a party of young men, and he was obliged to dine withthem. Their trivial conversation and idle jests did not interesthim, and as soon as coffee was brought he left them, inventing someengagement in order to get away. As he was going out of the club,the hall-porter handed him a letter. It was from Herr Winckelkopf,asking him to call down the next evening, and look at an explosiveumbrella, that went off as soon as it was opened. It was the verylatest invention, and had just arrived from Geneva. He tore theletter up into fragments. He had made up his mind not to try anymore experiments. Then he wandered down to the Thames Embankment,and sat for hours by the river. The moon peered through a mane oftawny clouds, as if it were a lion's eye, and innumerable starsspangled the hollow vault, like gold dust powdered on a purple dome.Now and then a barge swung out into the turbid stream, and floatedaway with the tide, and the railway signals changed from green toscarlet as the trains ran shrieking across the bridge. After sometime, twelve o'clock boomed from the tall tower at Westminster, andat each stroke of the sonorous bell the night seemed to tremble.Then the railway lights went out, one solitary lamp left gleaminglike a large ruby on a giant mast, and the roar of the city becamefainter.
At two o'clock he got up, and strolled towards Blackfriars. Howunreal everything looked! How like a strange dream! The houses onthe other side of the river seemed built out of darkness. One wouldhave said that silver and shadow had fashioned the world anew. Thehuge dome of St. Paul's loomed like a bubble through the dusky air.
As he approached Cleopatra's Needle he saw a man leaning over theparapet, and as he came nearer the man looked up, the gas-lightfalling full upon his face.
It was Mr. Podgers, the cheiromantist! No one could mistake thefat, flabby face, the gold-rimmed spectacles, the sickly feeblesmile, the sensual mouth.
Lord Arthur stopped. A brilliant idea flashed across him, and hestole softly up behind. In a moment he had seized Mr. Podgers bythe legs, and flung him into the Thames. There was a coarse oath, aheavy splash, and all was still. Lord Arthur looked anxiously over,but could see nothing of the cheiromantist but a tall hat,pirouetting in an eddy of moonlit water. After a time it also sank,and no trace of Mr. Podgers was visible. Once he thought that hecaught sight of the bulky misshapen figure striking out for thestaircase by the bridge, and a horrible feeling of failure came overhim, but it turned out to be merely a reflection, and when the moonshone out from behind a cloud it passed away. At last he seemed tohave realised the decree of destiny. He heaved a deep sigh ofrelief, and Sybil's name came to his lips.
'Have you dropped anything, sir?' said a voice behind him suddenly.
He turned round, and saw a policeman with a bull's-eye lantern.
'Nothing of importance, sergeant,' he answered, smiling, and hailinga passing hansom, he jumped in, and told the man to drive toBelgrave Square.
For the next few days he alternated between hope and fear. Therewere moments when he almost expected Mr. Podgers to walk into theroom, and yet at other times he felt that Fate could not be sounjust to him. Twice he went to the cheiromantist's address in WestMoon Street, but he could not bring himself to ring the bell. Helonged for certainty, and was afraid of it.
Finally it came. He was sitting in the smoking-room of the clubhaving tea, and listening rather wearily to Surbiton's account ofthe last comic song at the Gaiety, when the waiter came in with theevening papers. He took up the St. James's, and was listlesslyturning over its pages, when this strange heading caught his eye:
SUICIDE OF A CHEIROMANTIST.
He turned pale with excitement, and began to read. The paragraphran as follows:
Yesterday morning, at seven o'clock, the body of Mr. Septimus R.Podgers, the eminent cheiromantist, was washed on shore atGreenwich, just in front of the Ship Hotel. The unfortunategentleman had been missing for some days, and considerable anxietyfor his safety had been felt in cheiromantic circles. It issupposed that he committed suicide under the influence of atemporary mental derangement, caused by overwork, and a verdict tothat effect was returned this afternoon by the coroner's jury. Mr.Podgers had just completed an elaborate treatise on the subject ofthe Human Hand, that will shortly be published, when it will nodoubt attract much attention. The deceased was sixty-five years ofage, and does not seem to have left any relations.
Lord Arthur rushed out of the club with the paper still in his hand,to the immense amazement of the hall-porter, who tried in vain tostop him, and drove at once to Park Lane. Sybil saw him from thewindow, and something told her that he was the bearer of good news.She ran down to meet him, and, when she saw his face, she knew thatall was well.
'My dear Sybil,' cried Lord Arthur, 'let us be married to-morrow!'
'You foolish boy! Why, the cake is not even ordered!' said Sybil,laughing through her tears.
