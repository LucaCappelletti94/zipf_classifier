The narrow canon in which Nablous, or Shechem, is situated, is under highcultivation, and the soil is exceedingly black and fertile. It is wellwatered, and its affluent vegetation gains effect by contrast with thebarren hills that tower on either side. One of these hills is theancient Mount of Blessings and the other the Mount of Curses and wise menwho seek for fulfillments of prophecy think they find here a wonder ofthis kind--to wit, that the Mount of Blessings is strangely fertile andits mate as strangely unproductive. We could not see that there wasreally much difference between them in this respect, however.
Shechem is distinguished as one of the residences of the patriarch Jacob,and as the seat of those tribes that cut themselves loose from theirbrethren of Israel and propagated doctrines not in conformity with thoseof the original Jewish creed. For thousands of years this clan havedwelt in Shechem under strict tabu, and having little commerce orfellowship with their fellow men of any religion or nationality. Forgenerations they have not numbered more than one or two hundred, but theystill adhere to their ancient faith and maintain their ancient rites andceremonies. Talk of family and old descent! Princes and nobles pridethemselves upon lineages they can trace back some hundreds of years.What is this trifle to this handful of old first families of Shechem whocan name their fathers straight back without a flaw for thousands--straight back to a period so remote that men reared in a country wherethe days of two hundred years ago are called "ancient" times grow dazedand bewildered when they try to comprehend it! Here is respectabilityfor you--here is "family"--here is high descent worth talking about.This sad, proud remnant of a once mighty community still hold themselvesaloof from all the world; they still live as their fathers lived, laboras their fathers labored, think as they did, feel as they did, worship inthe same place, in sight of the same landmarks, and in the same quaint,patriarchal way their ancestors did more than thirty centuries ago. Ifound myself gazing at any straggling scion of this strange race with ariveted fascination, just as one would stare at a living mastodon, or amegatherium that had moved in the grey dawn of creation and seen thewonders of that mysterious world that was before the flood.
Carefully preserved among the sacred archives of this curious communityis a MSS. copy of the ancient Jewish law, which is said to be the oldestdocument on earth. It is written on vellum, and is some four or fivethousand years old. Nothing but bucksheesh can purchase a sight. Itsfame is somewhat dimmed in these latter days, because of the doubts somany authors of Palestine travels have felt themselves privileged to castupon it. Speaking of this MSS. reminds me that I procured from thehigh-priest of this ancient Samaritan community, at great expense, asecret document of still higher antiquity and far more extraordinaryinterest, which I propose to publish as soon as I have finishedtranslating it.
Joshua gave his dying injunction to the children of Israel at Shechem,and buried a valuable treasure secretly under an oak tree there about thesame time. The superstitious Samaritans have always been afraid to huntfor it. They believe it is guarded by fierce spirits invisible to men.
About a mile and a half from Shechem we halted at the base of Mount Ebalbefore a little square area, inclosed by a high stone wall, neatlywhitewashed. Across one end of this inclosure is a tomb built after themanner of the Moslems. It is the tomb of Joseph. No truth is betterauthenticated than this.
When Joseph was dying he prophesied that exodus of the Israelites fromEgypt which occurred four hundred years afterwards. At the same time heexacted of his people an oath that when they journeyed to the land ofCanaan they would bear his bones with them and bury them in the ancientinheritance of his fathers. The oath was kept. "And the bones of Joseph,which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they inShechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamorthe father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of silver."
Few tombs on earth command the veneration of so many races and men ofdivers creeds as this of Joseph. "Samaritan and Jew, Moslem andChristian alike, revere it, and honor it with their visits. The tomb ofJoseph, the dutiful son, the affectionate, forgiving brother, thevirtuous man, the wise Prince and ruler. Egypt felt his influence--theworld knows his history."
In this same "parcel of ground" which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamorfor a hundred pieces of silver, is Jacob's celebrated well. It is cut inthe solid rock, and is nine feet square and ninety feet deep. The nameof this unpretending hole in the ground, which one might pass by and takeno notice of, is as familiar as household words to even the children andthe peasants of many a far-off country. It is more famous than theParthenon; it is older than the Pyramids.
It was by this well that Jesus sat and talked with a woman of thatstrange, antiquated Samaritan community I have been speaking of, and toldher of the mysterious water of life. As descendants of old Englishnobles still cherish in the traditions of their houses how that this kingor that king tarried a day with some favored ancestor three hundred yearsago, no doubt the descendants of the woman of Samaria, living there inShechem, still refer with pardonable vanity to this conversation of theirancestor, held some little time gone by, with the Messiah of theChristians. It is not likely that they undervalue a distinction such asthis. Samaritan nature is human nature, and human nature rememberscontact with the illustrious, always.
For an offense done to the family honor, the sons of Jacob exterminatedall Shechem once.
We left Jacob's Well and traveled till eight in the evening, but ratherslowly, for we had been in the saddle nineteen hours, and the horses werecruelly tired. We got so far ahead of the tents that we had to camp inan Arab village, and sleep on the ground. We could have slept in thelargest of the houses; but there were some little drawbacks: it waspopulous with vermin, it had a dirt floor, it was in no respect cleanly,and there was a family of goats in the only bedroom, and two donkeys inthe parlor. Outside there were no inconveniences, except that the dusky,ragged, earnest-eyed villagers of both sexes and all ages groupedthemselves on their haunches all around us, and discussed us andcriticised us with noisy tongues till midnight. We did not mind thenoise, being tired, but, doubtless, the reader is aware that it is almostan impossible thing to go to sleep when you know that people are lookingat you. We went to bed at ten, and got up again at two and started oncemore. Thus are people persecuted by dragomen, whose sole ambition inlife is to get ahead of each other.
About daylight we passed Shiloh, where the Ark of the Covenant restedthree hundred years, and at whose gates good old Eli fell down and "brakehis neck" when the messenger, riding hard from the battle, told him ofthe defeat of his people, the death of his sons, and, more than all, thecapture of Israel's pride, her hope, her refuge, the ancient Ark herforefathers brought with them out of Egypt. It is little wonder thatunder circumstances like these he fell down and brake his neck. ButShiloh had no charms for us. We were so cold that there was no comfortbut in motion, and so drowsy we could hardly sit upon the horses.
After a while we came to a shapeless mass of ruins, which still bears thename of Bethel. It was here that Jacob lay down and had that superbvision of angels flitting up and down a ladder that reached from theclouds to earth, and caught glimpses of their blessed home through theopen gates of Heaven.
The pilgrims took what was left of the hallowed ruin, and we pressed ontoward the goal of our crusade, renowned Jerusalem.
The further we went the hotter the sun got, and the more rocky and bare,repulsive and dreary the landscape became. There could not have beenmore fragments of stone strewn broadcast over this part of the world, ifevery ten square feet of the land had been occupied by a separate anddistinct stonecutter's establishment for an age. There was hardly a treeor a shrub any where. Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friendsof a worthless soil, had almost deserted the country. No landscapeexists that is more tiresome to the eye than that which bounds theapproaches to Jerusalem. The only difference between the roads and thesurrounding country, perhaps, is that there are rather more rocks in theroads than in the surrounding country.
We passed Ramah, and Beroth, and on the right saw the tomb of the prophetSamuel, perched high upon a commanding eminence. Still no Jerusalem camein sight. We hurried on impatiently. We halted a moment at the ancientFountain of Beira, but its stones, worn deeply by the chins of thirstyanimals that are dead and gone centuries ago, had no interest for us--welonged to see Jerusalem. We spurred up hill after hill, and usuallybegan to stretch our necks minutes before we got to the top--butdisappointment always followed:--more stupid hills beyond--more unsightlylandscape--no Holy City.
At last, away in the middle of the day, ancient bite of wall andcrumbling arches began to line the way--we toiled up one more hill, andevery pilgrim and every sinner swung his hat on high! Jerusalem!
Perched on its eternal hills, white and domed and solid, massed togetherand hooped with high gray walls, the venerable city gleamed in the sun.So small! Why, it was no larger than an American village of fourthousand inhabitants, and no larger than an ordinary Syrian city ofthirty thousand. Jerusalem numbers only fourteen thousand people.
We dismounted and looked, without speaking a dozen sentences, across thewide intervening valley for an hour or more; and noted those prominentfeatures of the city that pictures make familiar to all men from theirschool days till their death. We could recognize the Tower of Hippicus,the Mosque of Omar, the Damascus Gate, the Mount of Olives, the Valley ofJehoshaphat, the Tower of David, and the Garden of Gethsemane--and datingfrom these landmarks could tell very nearly the localities of many otherswe were not able to distinguish.
I record it here as a notable but not discreditable fact that not evenour pilgrims wept. I think there was no individual in the party whosebrain was not teeming with thoughts and images and memories invoked bythe grand history of the venerable city that lay before us, but stillamong them all was no "voice of them that wept."
There was no call for tears. Tears would have been out of place. Thethoughts Jerusalem suggests are full of poetry, sublimity, and more thanall, dignity. Such thoughts do not find their appropriate expression inthe emotions of the nursery.
Just after noon we entered these narrow, crooked streets, by the ancientand the famed Damascus Gate, and now for several hours I have been tryingto comprehend that I am actually in the illustrious old city whereSolomon dwelt, where Abraham held converse with the Deity, and wherewalls still stand that witnessed the spectacle of the Crucifixion.
