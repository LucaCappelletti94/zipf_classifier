To return, now, to where I was, and tell you the rest.  We shallnever know how she came to be there; there is no way to account forit.  She was always watching for black and shiny and spiritedhorses - watching, hoping, despairing, hoping again; always givingchase and sounding her call, upon the meagrest chance of aresponse, and breaking her heart over the disappointment; alwaysinquiring, always interested in sales-stables and horseaccumulations in general.  How she got there must remain a mystery.
At the point which I had reached in a preceding paragraph of thisaccount, the situation was as follows:  two horses lay dying; thebull had scattered his persecutors for the moment, and stoodraging, panting, pawing the dust in clouds over his back, when theman that had been wounded returned to the ring on a remount, a poorblindfolded wreck that yet had something ironically military abouthis bearing - and the next moment the bull had ripped him open andhis bowls were dragging upon the ground:  and the bull was charginghis swarm of pests again.  Then came pealing through the air abugle-call that froze my blood - "IT IS I, SOLDIER - COME!"  Iturned; Cathy was flying down through the massed people; shecleared the parapet at a bound, and sped towards that riderlesshorse, who staggered forward towards the remembered sound; but hisstrength failed, and he fell at her feet, she lavishing kisses uponhim and sobbing, the house rising with one impulse, and white withhorror!  Before help could reach her the bull was back again -
She was never conscious again in life.  We bore her home, allmangled and drenched in blood, and knelt by her and listened to herbroken and wandering words, and prayed for her passing spirit, andthere was no comfort - nor ever will be, I think.  But she washappy, for she was far away under another sky, and comrading againwith her Rangers, and her animal friends, and the soldiers.  Theirnames fell softly and caressingly from her lips, one by one, withpauses between.  She was not in pain, but lay with closed eyes,vacantly murmuring, as one who dreams.  Sometimes she smiled,saying nothing; sometimes she smiled when she uttered a name - suchas Shekels, or BB, or Potter.  Sometimes she was at her fort,issuing commands; sometimes she was careering over the plain at thehead of her men; sometimes she was training her horse; once shesaid, reprovingly, "You are giving me the wrong foot; give me theleft - don't you know it is good-bye?"
After this, she lay silent some time; the end was near.  By-and-byshe murmured, "Tired . . . sleepy . . . take Cathy, mamma."  Then,"Kiss me, Soldier."  For a little time, she lay so still that wewere doubtful if she breathed.  Then she put out her hand and beganto feel gropingly about; then said, "I cannot find it; blow'taps.'"  It was the end.
