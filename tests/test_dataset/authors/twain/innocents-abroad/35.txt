We left a dozen passengers in Constantinople, and sailed through thebeautiful Bosporus and far up into the Black Sea. We left them in theclutches of the celebrated Turkish guide, "FAR-AWAY MOSES," who willseduce them into buying a ship-load of ottar of roses, splendid Turkishvestments, and all manner of curious things they can never have any usefor. Murray's invaluable guide-books have mentioned 'Far-away Moses'name, and he is a made man. He rejoices daily in the fact that he is arecognized celebrity. However, we can not alter our established customsto please the whims of guides; we can not show partialities this late inthe day. Therefore, ignoring this fellow's brilliant fame, and ignoringthe fanciful name he takes such pride in, we called him Ferguson, just aswe had done with all other guides. It has kept him in a state ofsmothered exasperation all the time. Yet we meant him no harm. After hehas gotten himself up regardless of expense, in showy, baggy trowsers,yellow, pointed slippers, fiery fez, silken jacket of blue, voluminouswaist-sash of fancy Persian stuff filled with a battery of silver-mountedhorse-pistols, and has strapped on his terrible scimitar, he considers itan unspeakable humiliation to be called Ferguson. It can not be helped.All guides are Fergusons to us. We can not master their dreadful foreignnames.
Sebastopol is probably the worst battered town in Russia or any whereelse. But we ought to be pleased with it, nevertheless, for we have beenin no country yet where we have been so kindly received, and where wefelt that to be Americans was a sufficient visa for our passports. Themoment the anchor was down, the Governor of the town immediatelydispatched an officer on board to inquire if he could be of anyassistance to us, and to invite us to make ourselves at home inSebastopol! If you know Russia, you know that this was a wild stretch ofhospitality. They are usually so suspicious of strangers that they worrythem excessively with the delays and aggravations incident to acomplicated passport system. Had we come from any other country we couldnot have had permission to enter Sebastopol and leave again under threedays--but as it was, we were at liberty to go and come when and where wepleased. Every body in Constantinople warned us to be very careful aboutour passports, see that they were strictly 'en regle', and never tomislay them for a moment: and they told us of numerous instances ofEnglishmen and others who were delayed days, weeks, and even months, inSebastopol, on account of trifling informalities in their passports, andfor which they were not to blame. I had lost my passport, and wastraveling under my room-mate's, who stayed behind in Constantinople toawait our return. To read the description of him in that passport andthen look at me, any man could see that I was no more like him than I amlike Hercules. So I went into the harbor of Sebastopol with fear andtrembling--full of a vague, horrible apprehension that I was going to befound out and hanged. But all that time my true passport had beenfloating gallantly overhead--and behold it was only our flag. They neverasked us for any other.
We have had a great many Russian and English gentlemen and ladies onboard to-day, and the time has passed cheerfully away. They were allhappy-spirited people, and I never heard our mother tongue sound sopleasantly as it did when it fell from those English lips in this far-offland. I talked to the Russians a good deal, just to be friendly, andthey talked to me from the same motive; I am sure that both enjoyed theconversation, but never a word of it either of us understood. I did mostof my talking to those English people though, and I am sorry we can notcarry some of them along with us.
We have gone whithersoever we chose, to-day, and have met with nothingbut the kindest attentions. Nobody inquired whether we had any passportsor not.
Several of the officers of the Government have suggested that we take theship to a little watering-place thirty miles from here, and pay theEmperor of Russia a visit. He is rusticating there. These officers saidthey would take it upon themselves to insure us a cordial reception.They said if we would go, they would not only telegraph the Emperor, butsend a special courier overland to announce our coming. Our time is soshort, though, and more especially our coal is so nearly out, that wejudged it best to forego the rare pleasure of holding social intercoursewith an Emperor.
Ruined Pompeii is in good condition compared to Sebastopol. Here, youmay look in whatsoever direction you please, and your eye encountersscarcely any thing but ruin, ruin, ruin!--fragments of houses, crumbledwalls, torn and ragged hills, devastation every where! It is as if amighty earthquake had spent all its terrible forces upon this one littlespot. For eighteen long months the storms of war beat upon the helplesstown, and left it at last the saddest wreck that ever the sun has lookedupon. Not one solitary house escaped unscathed--not one remainedhabitable, even. Such utter and complete ruin one could hardly conceiveof. The houses had all been solid, dressed stone structures; most ofthem were ploughed through and through by cannon balls--unroofed andsliced down from eaves to foundation--and now a row of them, half a milelong, looks merely like an endless procession of battered chimneys. Nosemblance of a house remains in such as these. Some of the largerbuildings had corners knocked off; pillars cut in two; cornices smashed;holes driven straight through the walls. Many of these holes are asround and as cleanly cut as if they had been made with an auger. Othersare half pierced through, and the clean impression is there in the rock,as smooth and as shapely as if it were done in putty. Here and there aball still sticks in a wall, and from it iron tears trickle down anddiscolor the stone.
The battle-fields were pretty close together. The Malakoff tower is ona hill which is right in the edge of the town. The Redan was withinrifle-shot of the Malakoff; Inkerman was a mile away; and Balaklavaremoved but an hour's ride. The French trenches, by which theyapproached and invested the Malakoff were carried so close under itssloping sides that one might have stood by the Russian guns and tossed astone into them. Repeatedly, during three terrible days, they swarmed upthe little Malakoff hill, and were beaten back with terrible slaughter.Finally, they captured the place, and drove the Russians out, who thentried to retreat into the town, but the English had taken the Redan, andshut them off with a wall of flame; there was nothing for them to do butgo back and retake the Malakoff or die under its guns. They did goback; they took the Malakoff and retook it two or three times, but theirdesperate valor could not avail, and they had to give up at last.
These fearful fields, where such tempests of death used to rage, arepeaceful enough now; no sound is heard, hardly a living thing moves aboutthem, they are lonely and silent--their desolation is complete.
There was nothing else to do, and so every body went to hunting relics.They have stocked the ship with them. They brought them from theMalakoff, from the Redan, Inkerman, Balaklava--every where. They havebrought cannon balls, broken ramrods, fragments of shell--iron enough tofreight a sloop. Some have even brought bones--brought them laboriouslyfrom great distances, and were grieved to hear the surgeon pronounce themonly bones of mules and oxen. I knew Blucher would not lose anopportunity like this. He brought a sack full on board and was going foranother. I prevailed upon him not to go. He has already turned hisstate-room into a museum of worthless trumpery, which he has gathered upin his travels. He is labeling his trophies, now. I picked up one awhile ago, and found it marked "Fragment of a Russian General." Icarried it out to get a better light upon it--it was nothing but a coupleof teeth and part of the jaw-bone of a horse. I said with some asperity:
"Fragment of a Russian General! This is absurd. Are you never going tolearn any sense?"
He only said: "Go slow--the old woman won't know any different." [Hisaunt.]
This person gathers mementoes with a perfect recklessness, now-a-days;mixes them all up together, and then serenely labels them without anyregard to truth, propriety, or even plausibility. I have found himbreaking a stone in two, and labeling half of it "Chunk busted from thepulpit of Demosthenes," and the other half "Darnick from the Tomb ofAbelard and Heloise." I have known him to gather up a handful of pebblesby the roadside, and bring them on board ship and label them as comingfrom twenty celebrated localities five hundred miles apart. Iremonstrate against these outrages upon reason and truth, of course, butit does no good. I get the same tranquil, unanswerable reply every time:
"It don't signify--the old woman won't know any different."
Ever since we three or four fortunate ones made the midnight trip toAthens, it has afforded him genuine satisfaction to give every body inthe ship a pebble from the Mars-hill where St. Paul preached. He got allthose pebbles on the sea shore, abreast the ship, but professes to havegathered them from one of our party. However, it is not of any use forme to expose the deception--it affords him pleasure, and does no harm toany body. He says he never expects to run out of mementoes of St. Paulas long as he is in reach of a sand-bank. Well, he is no worse thanothers. I notice that all travelers supply deficiencies in theircollections in the same way. I shall never have any confidence in suchthings again while I live.
