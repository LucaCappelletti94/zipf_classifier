All day Sunday at anchor. The storm had gone down a great deal, but thesea had not. It was still piling its frothy hills high in air "outside,"as we could plainly see with the glasses. We could not properly begin apleasure excursion on Sunday; we could not offer untried stomachs to sopitiless a sea as that. We must lie still till Monday. And we did. Butwe had repetitions of church and prayer-meetings; and so, of course, wewere just as eligibly situated as we could have been any where.
I was up early that Sabbath morning and was early to breakfast. I felt aperfectly natural desire to have a good, long, unprejudiced look at thepassengers at a time when they should be free from self-consciousness--which is at breakfast, when such a moment occurs in the lives of humanbeings at all.
I was greatly surprised to see so many elderly people--I might almostsay, so many venerable people. A glance at the long lines of heads wasapt to make one think it was all gray. But it was not. There was atolerably fair sprinkling of young folks, and another fair sprinkling ofgentlemen and ladies who were non-committal as to age, being neitheractually old or absolutely young.
The next morning we weighed anchor and went to sea. It was a greathappiness to get away after this dragging, dispiriting delay. I thoughtthere never was such gladness in the air before, such brightness in thesun, such beauty in the sea. I was satisfied with the picnic then andwith all its belongings. All my malicious instincts were dead within me;and as America faded out of sight, I think a spirit of charity rose up intheir place that was as boundless, for the time being, as the broad oceanthat was heaving its billows about us. I wished to express my feelings--I wished to lift up my voice and sing; but I did not know anything tosing, and so I was obliged to give up the idea. It was no loss to theship, though, perhaps.
It was breezy and pleasant, but the sea was still very rough. One couldnot promenade without risking his neck; at one moment the bowsprit wastaking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven, and at the next it wastrying to harpoon a shark in the bottom of the ocean. What a weirdsensation it is to feel the stem of a ship sinking swiftly from under youand see the bow climbing high away among the clouds! One's safest coursethat day was to clasp a railing and hang on; walking was too precarious apastime.
By some happy fortune I was not seasick.--That was a thing to be proudof. I had not always escaped before. If there is one thing in the worldthat will make a man peculiarly and insufferably self-conceited, it is tohave his stomach behave itself, the first day it sea, when nearly all hiscomrades are seasick. Soon a venerable fossil, shawled to the chin andbandaged like a mummy, appeared at the door of the after deck-house, andthe next lurch of the ship shot him into my arms. I said:
"Good-morning, Sir. It is a fine day."
He put his hand on his stomach and said, "Oh, my!" and then staggeredaway and fell over the coop of a skylight.
Presently another old gentleman was projected from the same door withgreat violence. I said:
"Calm yourself, Sir--There is no hurry. It is a fine day, Sir."
He, also, put his hand on his stomach and said "Oh, my!" and reeled away.
In a little while another veteran was discharged abruptly from the samedoor, clawing at the air for a saving support. I said:
"Good morning, Sir. It is a fine day for pleasuring. You were about tosay--"
"Oh, my!"
I thought so. I anticipated him, anyhow. I stayed there and wasbombarded with old gentlemen for an hour, perhaps; and all I got out ofany of them was "Oh, my!"
I went away then in a thoughtful mood. I said, this is a good pleasureexcursion. I like it. The passengers are not garrulous, but still theyare sociable. I like those old people, but somehow they all seem to havethe "Oh, my" rather bad.
I knew what was the matter with them. They were seasick. And I was gladof it. We all like to see people seasick when we are not, ourselves.Playing whist by the cabin lamps when it is storming outside is pleasant;walking the quarterdeck in the moonlight is pleasant; smoking in thebreezy foretop is pleasant when one is not afraid to go up there; butthese are all feeble and commonplace compared with the joy of seeingpeople suffering the miseries of seasickness.
I picked up a good deal of information during the afternoon. At one timeI was climbing up the quarterdeck when the vessel's stem was in the sky;I was smoking a cigar and feeling passably comfortable. Somebodyejaculated:
"Come, now, that won't answer. Read the sign up there--NO SMOKING ABAFTTHE WHEEL!"
It was Captain Duncan, chief of the expedition. I went forward, ofcourse. I saw a long spyglass lying on a desk in one of the upper-deckstate-rooms back of the pilot-house and reached after it--there was aship in the distance.
"Ah, ah--hands off! Come out of that!"
I came out of that. I said to a deck-sweep--but in a low voice:
"Who is that overgrown pirate with the whiskers and the discordantvoice?"
"It's Captain Bursley--executive officer--sailing master."
I loitered about awhile, and then, for want of something better to do,fell to carving a railing with my knife. Somebody said, in aninsinuating, admonitory voice:
"Now, say--my friend--don't you know any better than to be whittling theship all to pieces that way? You ought to know better than that."
I went back and found the deck sweep.
"Who is that smooth-faced, animated outrage yonder in the fine clothes?"
"That's Captain L****, the owner of the ship--he's one of the mainbosses."
In the course of time I brought up on the starboard side of thepilot-house and found a sextant lying on a bench. Now, I said, they"take the sun" through this thing; I should think I might see that vesselthrough it. I had hardly got it to my eye when someone touched me on theshoulder and said deprecatingly:
"I'll have to get you to give that to me, Sir. If there's anything you'dlike to know about taking the sun, I'd as soon tell you as not--but Idon't like to trust anybody with that instrument. If you want anyfiguring done--Aye, aye, sir!"
He was gone to answer a call from the other side. I sought thedeck-sweep.
"Who is that spider-legged gorilla yonder with the sanctimoniouscountenance?"
"It's Captain Jones, sir--the chief mate."
"Well. This goes clear away ahead of anything I ever heard of before.Do you--now I ask you as a man and a brother--do you think I couldventure to throw a rock here in any given direction without hitting acaptain of this ship?"
"Well, sir, I don't know--I think likely you'd fetch the captain of thewatch may be, because he's a-standing right yonder in the way."
I went below--meditating and a little downhearted. I thought, if fivecooks can spoil a broth, what may not five captains do with a pleasureexcursion.
