(This article, written during the autumn of 1899, was aboutthe last writing done by Mark Twain on any impersonal subject.)I have had a kindly feeling, a friendly feeling, a cousinlyfeeling toward Simplified Spelling, from the beginning of themovement three years ago, but nothing more inflamed than that.It seemed to me to merely propose to substitute one inadequacyfor another; a sort of patching and plugging poor old dentalrelics with cement and gold and porcelain paste; what was reallyneeded was a new set of teeth. That is to say, a new ALPHABET.The heart of our trouble is with our foolish alphabet. Itdoesn't know how to spell, and can't be taught. In this it islike all other alphabets except one--the phonographic. This isthe only competent alphabet in the world. It can spell andcorrectly pronounce any word in our language.That admirable alphabet, that brilliant alphabet, thatinspired alphabet, can be learned in an hour or two. In a weekthe student can learn to write it with some little facility, andto read it with considerable ease. I know, for I saw it tried ina public school in Nevada forty-five years ago, and was soimpressed by the incident that it has remained in my memory eversince.I wish we could adopt it in place of our present written(and printed) character. I mean SIMPLY the alphabet; simply theconsonants and the vowels--I don't mean any REDUCTIONS orabbreviations of them, such as the shorthand writer uses in orderto get compression and speed. No, I would SPELL EVERY WORD OUT.I will insert the alphabet here as I find it in Burnz'sPHONIC SHORTHAND. [Figure 1] It is arranged on the basis ofIsaac Pitman's PHONOGRAPHY. Isaac Pitman was the originator andfather of scientific phonography. It is used throughout theglobe. It was a memorable invention. He made it public seventy-three years ago. The firm of Isaac Pitman & Sons, New York,still exists, and they continue the master's work.What should we gain?First of all, we could spell DEFINITELY--and correctly--anyword you please, just by the SOUND of it. We can't do that withour present alphabet. For instance, take a simple, every-dayword PHTHISIS. If we tried to spell it by the sound of it, weshould make it TYSIS, and be laughed at by every educated person.Secondly, we should gain in REDUCTION OF LABOR in writing.Simplified Spelling makes valuable reductions in the case ofseveral hundred words, but the new spelling must be LEARNED. Youcan't spell them by the sound; you must get them out of the book.But even if we knew the simplified form for every word inthe language, the phonographic alphabet would still beat theSimplified Speller "hands down" in the important matter ofeconomy of labor. I will illustrate:PRESENT FORM: through, laugh, highland.SIMPLIFIED FORM: thru, laff, hyland.PHONOGRAPHIC FORM: [Figure 2]To write the word "through," the pen has to make twenty-one strokes.To write the word "thru," then pen has to make twelve strokes--a good saving.To write that same word with the phonographic alphabet, thepen has to make only THREE strokes.To write the word "laugh," the pen has to make FOURTEENstrokes.To write "laff," the pen has to make the SAME NUMBER ofstrokes--no labor is saved to the penman.To write the same word with the phonographic alphabet, thepen has to make only THREE strokes.To write the word "highland," the pen has to make twenty-twostrokes.To write "hyland," the pen has to make eighteen strokes.To write that word with the phonographic alphabet, the penhas to make only FIVE strokes. [Figure 3]To write the words "phonographic alphabet," the pen has to make fifty-three strokes.To write "fonografic alfabet," the pen has to make fifty strokes.To the penman, the saving in labor is insignificant.To write that word (with vowels) with the phonographicalphabet, the pen has to make only SEVENTEEN strokes.Without the vowels, only THIRTEEN strokes. [Figure 4] Thevowels are hardly necessary, this time.We make five pen-strokes in writing an m. Thus: [Figure 5]a stroke down; a stroke up; a second stroke down; a second strokeup; a final stroke down. Total, five. The phonographic alphabetaccomplishes the m with a single stroke--a curve, like aparenthesis that has come home drunk and has fallen face downright at the front door where everybody that goes along will seehim and say, Alas!When our written m is not the end of a word, but isotherwise located, it has to be connected with the next letter,and that requires another pen-stroke, making six in all, beforeyou get rid of that m. But never mind about the connectingstrokes--let them go. Without counting them, the twenty-sixletters of our alphabet consumed about eighty pen-strokes fortheir construction--about three pen-strokes per letter.It is THREE TIMES THE NUMBER required by the phonographicalphabet. It requires but ONE stroke for each letter.My writing-gait is--well, I don't know what it is, but Iwill time myself and see. Result: it is twenty-four words perminute. I don't mean composing; I mean COPYING. There isn't anydefinite composing-gait.Very well, my copying-gait is 1,440 words per hour--say1,500. If I could use the phonographic character with facility Icould do the 1,500 in twenty minutes. I could do nine hours'copying in three hours; I could do three years' copying in oneyear. Also, if I had a typewriting machine with the phonographicalphabet on it--oh, the miracles I could do!I am not pretending to write that character well. I havenever had a lesson, and I am copying the letters from the book.But I can accomplish my desire, at any rate, which is, to makethe reader get a good and clear idea of the advantage it would beto us if we could discard our present alphabet and put thisbetter one in its place--using it in books, newspapers, with thetypewriter, and with the pen.[Figure 6]--MAN DOG HORSE. I think it is graceful andwould look comely in print. And consider--once more, I beg--whata labor-saver it is! Ten pen-strokes with the one system toconvey those three words above, and thirty-three by the other![Figure 6] I mean, in SOME ways, not in all. I suppose I mightgo so far as to say in most ways, and be within the facts, butnever mind; let it go at SOME. One of the ways in which itexercises this birthright is--as I think--continuing to use ourlaughable alphabet these seventy-three years while there was arational one at hand, to be had for the taking.It has taken five hundred years to simplify some ofChaucer's rotten spelling--if I may be allowed to use to frank aterm as that--and it will take five hundred years more to get ourexasperating new Simplified Corruptions accepted and runningsmoothly. And we sha'n't be any better off then than we are now;for in that day we shall still have the privilege the Simplifiersare exercising now: ANYBODY can change the spelling that wantsto.BUT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE PHONOGRAPHIC SPELLING; THERE ISN'TANY WAY. It will always follow the SOUND. If you want to changethe spelling, you have to change the sound first.Mind, I myself am a Simplified Speller; I belong to thatunhappy guild that is patiently and hopefully trying to reformour drunken old alphabet by reducing his whiskey. Well, it willimprove him. When they get through and have reformed him allthey can by their system he will be only HALF drunk. Above thatcondition their system can never lift him. There is nocompetent, and lasting, and real reform for him but to take awayhis whiskey entirely, and fill up his jug with Pitman's wholesomeand undiseased alphabet.One great drawback to Simplified Spelling is, that in printa simplified word looks so like the very nation! and when youbunch a whole squadron of the Simplified together the spectacleis very nearly unendurable.The da ma ov koars kum when the publik ma be expektd to getrekonsyled to the bezair asspekt of the Simplified Kombynashuns,but--if I may be allowed the expression--is it worth the wastedtime? [Figure 7]To see our letters put together in ways to which we are not accustomedoffends the eye, and also takes the EXPRESSION out of the words.La on, Makduf, and damd be he hoo furst krys hold, enuf!It doesn't thrill you as it used to do. The simplificationshave sucked the thrill all out of it.But a written character with which we are NOT ACQUAINTEDdoes not offend us--Greek, Hebrew, Russian, Arabic, and theothers--they have an interesting look, and we see beauty in them,too. And this is true of hieroglyphics, as well. There issomething pleasant and engaging about the mathematical signs whenwe do not understand them. The mystery hidden in these thingshas a fascination for us: we can't come across a printed page ofshorthand without being impressed by it and wishing we could readit.Very well, what I am offering for acceptance and adopting isnot shorthand, but longhand, written with the SHORTHAND ALPHABETUNREACHED. You can write three times as many words in a minutewith it as you can write with our alphabet. And so, in a way, itIS properly a shorthand. It has a pleasant look, too; abeguiling look, an inviting look. I will write something in it,in my rude and untaught way: [Figure 8]Even when _I_ do it it comes out prettier than it does inSimplified Spelling. Yes, and in the Simplified it costs onehundred and twenty-three pen-strokes to write it, whereas in thephonographic it costs only twenty-nine.[Figure 9] is probably [Figure 10].Let us hope so, anyway.
