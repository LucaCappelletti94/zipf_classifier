Oh, it is wonderful here, aunty dear, just paradise!  Oh, if youcould only see it! everything so wild and lovely; such grandplains, stretching such miles and miles and miles, all the mostdelicious velvety sand and sage-brush, and rabbits as big as a dog,and such tall and noble jackassful ears that that is what they namethem by; and such vast mountains, and so rugged and craggy andlofty, with cloud-shawls wrapped around their shoulders, andlooking so solemn and awful and satisfied; and the charmingIndians, oh, how you would dote on them, aunty dear, and they wouldon you, too, and they would let you hold their babies, the way theydo me, and they ARE the fattest, and brownest, and sweetest littlethings, and never cry, and wouldn't if they had pins sticking inthem, which they haven't, because they are poor and can't affordit; and the horses and mules and cattle and dogs - hundreds andhundreds and hundreds, and not an animal that you can't do what youplease with, except uncle Thomas, but I don't mind him, he'slovely; and oh, if you could hear the bugles:  TOO - TOO - TOO-TOO- TOO - TOO, and so on - perfectly beautiful!  Do you recognizethat one?  It's the first toots of the REVEILLE; it goes, dear me,SO early in the morning! - then I and every other soldier on thewhole place are up and out in a minute, except uncle Thomas, who ismost unaccountably lazy, I don't know why, but I have talked to himabout it, and I reckon it will be better, now.  He hasn't anyfaults much, and is charming and sweet, like Buffalo Bill, andThunder-Bird, and Mammy Dorcas, and Soldier Boy, and Shekels, andPotter, and Sour-Mash, and - well, they're ALL that, just angels,as you may say.
The very first day I came, I don't know how long ago it was,Buffalo Bill took me on Soldier Boy to Thunder-Bird's camp, not thebig one which is out on the plain, which is White Cloud's, he tookme to THAT one next day, but this one is four or five miles up inthe hills and crags, where there is a great shut-in meadow, full ofIndian lodges and dogs and squaws and everything that isinteresting, and a brook of the clearest water running through it,with white pebbles on the bottom and trees all along the banks cooland shady and good to wade in, and as the sun goes down it isdimmish in there, but away up against the sky you see the big peakstowering up and shining bright and vivid in the sun, and sometimesan eagle sailing by them, not flapping a wing, the same as if hewas asleep; and young Indians and girls romping and laughing andcarrying on, around the spring and the pool, and not much clotheson except the girls, and dogs fighting, and the squaws busy atwork, and the bucks busy resting, and the old men sitting in abunch smoking, and passing the pipe not to the left but to theright, which means there's been a row in the camp and they aresettling it if they can, and children playing JUST the same as anyother children, and little boys shooting at a mark with bows, and Icuffed one of them because he hit a dog with a club that wasn'tdoing anything, and he resented it but before long he wished hehadn't:  but this sentence is getting too long and I will startanother.  Thunder-Bird put on his Sunday-best war outfit to let mesee him, and he was splendid to look at, with his face painted redand bright and intense like a fire-coal and a valance of eaglefeathers from the top of his head all down his back, and he had histomahawk, too, and his pipe, which has a stem which is longer thanmy arm, and I never had such a good time in an Indian camp in mylife, and I learned a lot of words of the language, and next day BBtook me to the camp out on the Plains, four miles, and I hadanother good time and got acquainted with some more Indians anddogs; and the big chief, by the name of White Cloud, gave me apretty little bow and arrows and I gave him my red sash-ribbon, andin four days I could shoot very well with it and beat any white boyof my size at the post; and I have been to those camps plenty oftimes since; and I have learned to ride, too, BB taught me, andevery day he practises me and praises me, and every time I dobetter than ever he lets me have a scamper on Soldier Boy, andTHAT'S the last agony of pleasure! for he is the charmingest horse,and so beautiful and shiny and black, and hasn't another color onhim anywhere, except a white star in his forehead, not just animitation star, but a real one, with four points, shaped exactlylike a star that's hand-made, and if you should cover him all upbut his star you would know him anywhere, even in Jerusalem orAustralia, by that.  And I got acquainted with a good many of theSeventh Cavalry, and the dragoons, and officers, and families, andhorses, in the first few days, and some more in the next few andthe next few and the next few, and now I know more soldiers andhorses than you can think, no matter how hard you try.  I amkeeping up my studies every now and then, but there isn't much timefor it.  I love you so! and I send you a hug and a kiss.
CATHY.
