The Finding of the Dwarf
THIS EPISODE disagreed with me and I was not able to leave my bed thenext day. The others were in the same condition. But for this, one oranother of us might have had the good luck that fell to the Paladin'sshare that day; but it is observable that God in His compassion sends thegood luck to such as are ill equipped with gifts, as compensation fortheir defect, but requires such as are more fortunately endowed to get bylabor and talent what those others get by chance. It was Noel who saidthis, and it seemed to me to be well and justly thought.
The Paladin, going about the town all the day in order to be followed andadmired and overhear the people say in an awed voice, "'Ssh! --look, itis the Standard-Bearer of Joan of Arc!" had speech with all sorts andconditions of folk, and he learned from some boatmen that there was astir of some kind going on in the bastilles on the other side of theriver; and in the evening, seeking further, he found a deserter from thefortress called the "Augustins," who said that the English were going tosend me over to strengthen the garrisons on our side during the darknessof the night, and were exulting greatly, for they meant to spring uponDunois and the army when it was passing the bastilles and destroy it; athing quite easy to do, since the "Witch" would not be there, and withouther presence the army would do like the French armies of these many yearspast--drop their weapons and run when they saw an English face.
It was ten at night when the Paladin brought this news and asked leave tospeak to Joan, and I was up and on duty then. It was a bitter stroke tome to see what a chance I had lost. Joan made searching inquiries, andsatisfied herself that the word was true, then she made this annoyingremark:
"You have done well, and you have my thanks. It may be that you haveprevented a disaster. Your name and service shall receive officialmention."
Then he bowed low, and when he rose he was eleven feet high. As heswelled out past me he covertly pulled down the corner of his eye withhis finger and muttered part of that defiled refrain, "Oh, tears, ah,tears, oh, sad sweet tears!--name in General Orders--personal mention tothe King, you see!"
I wished Joan could have seen his conduct, but she was busy thinking whatshe would do. Then she had me fetch the knight Jean de Metz, and in aminute he was off for La Hire's quarters with orders for him and the Lordde Villars and Florent d'Illiers to report to her at five o'clock nextmorning with five hundred picked men well mounted. The histories say halfpast four, but it is not true, I heard the order given.
We were on our way at five to the minute, and encountered the head of thearriving column between six and seven, a couple of leagues from the city.Dunois was pleased, for the army had begun to get restive and showuneasiness now that it was getting so near to the dreaded bastilles. Butthat all disappeared now, as the word ran down the line, with a huzzathat swept along the length of it like a wave, that the Maid was come.Dunois asked her to halt and let the column pass in review, so that themen could be sure that the reports of her presence was not a ruse torevive their courage. So she took position at the side of the road withher staff, and the battalions swung by with a martial stride, huzzaing.Joan was armed, except her head. She was wearing the cunning littlevelvet cap with the mass of curved white ostrich plumes tumbling over itsedges which the city of Orleans had given her the night she arrived--theone that is in the picture that hangs in the H"tel de Ville at Rouen. Shewas looking about fifteen. The sight of soldiers always set her blood toleaping, and lit the fires in her eyes and brought the warm rich color toher cheeks; it was then that you saw that she was too beautiful to be ofthe earth, or at any rate that there was a subtle something somewhereabout her beauty that differed it from the human types of your experienceand exalted it above them.
In the train of wains laden with supplies a man lay on top of the goods.He was stretched out on his back, and his hands were tied together withropes, and also his ankles. Joan signed to the officer in charge of thatdivision of the train to come to her, and he rode up and saluted.
"What is he that is bound there?" she asked.
"A prisoner, General."
"What is his offense?"
"He is a deserter."
"What is to be done with him?"
"He will be hanged, but it was not convenient on the march, and there wasno hurry."
"Tell me about him."
"He is a good soldier, but he asked leave to go and see his wife who wasdying, he said, but it could not be granted; so he went without leave.Meanwhile the march began, and he only overtook us yesterday evening."
"Overtook you? Did he come of his own will?"
"Yes, it was of his own will."
"He a deserter! Name of God! Bring him to me."
The officer rode forward and loosed the man's feet and brought him backwith his hands still tied. What a figure he was--a good seven feet high,and built for business! He had a strong face; he had an unkempt shock ofblack hair which showed up a striking way when the officer removed hismorion for him; for weapon he had a big ax in his broad leathern belt.Standing by Joan's horse, he made Joan look littler than ever, for hishead was about on a level with her own. His face was profoundlymelancholy; all interest in life seemed to be dead in the man. Joan said:
"Hold up your hands."
The man's head was down. He lifted it when he heard that soft friendlyvoice, and there was a wistful something in his face which made one thinkthat there had been music in it for him and that he would like to hear itagain. When he raised his hands Joan laid her sword to his bonds, but theofficer said with apprehension:
"Ah, madam--my General!"
"What is it?" she said.
"He is under sentence!"
"Yes, I know. I am responsible for him"; and she cut the bonds. They hadlacerated his wrists, and they were bleeding. "Ah, pitiful!" she said;"blood--I do not like it"; and she shrank from the sight. But only for amoment. "Give me something, somebody, to bandage his wrists with."
The officer said:
"Ah, my General! it is not fitting. Let me bring another to do it."
"Another? De par le Dieu! You would seek far to find one that can do itbetter than I, for I learned it long ago among both men and beasts. And Ican tie better than those that did this; if I had tied him the ropes hadnot cut his flesh."
The man looked on silent, while he was being bandaged, stealing a furtiveglance at Joan's face occasionally, such as an animal might that isreceiving a kindness form an unexpected quarter and is gropingly tryingto reconcile the act with its source. All the staff had forgotten thehuzzaing army drifting by in its rolling clouds of dust, to crane theirnecks and watch the bandaging as if it was the most interesting andabsorbing novelty that ever was. I have often seen people do likethat--get entirely lost in the simplest trifle, when it is something thatis out of their line. Now there in Poitiers, once, I saw two bishops anda dozen of those grave and famous scholars grouped together watching aman paint a sign on a shop; they didn't breathe, they were as good asdead; and when it began to sprinkle they didn't know it at first; thenthey noticed it, and each man hove a deep sigh, and glanced up with asurprised look as wondering to see the others there, and how he came tobe there himself--but that is the way with people, as I have said. Thereis no way of accounting for people. You have to take them as they are.
"There," said Joan at last, pleased with her success; "another could havedone it no better--not as well, I think. Tell me--what is it you did?Tell me all."
The giant said:
"It was this way, my angel. My mother died, then my three littlechildren, one after the other, all in two years. It was the famine;others fared so--it was God's will. I saw them die; I had that grace; andI buried them. Then when my poor wife's fate was come, I begged for leaveto go to her--she who was so dear to me--she who was all I had; I beggedon my knees. But they would not let me. Could I let her die, friendlessand alone? Could I let her die believing I would not come? Would she letme die and she not come--with her feet free to do it if she would, and nocost upon it but only her life? Ah, she would come--she would comethrough the fire! So I went. I saw her. She died in my arms. I buriedher. Then the army was gone. I had trouble to overtake it, but my legsare long and there are many hours in a day; I overtook it last night."
Joan said, musingly, as if she were thinking aloud:
"It sounds true. If true, it were no great harm to suspend the law thisone time--any would say that. It may not be true, but if it is true--"She turned suddenly to the man and said, "I would see your eyes--lookup!" The eyes of the two met, and Joan said to the officer, "This man ispardoned. Give you good day; you may go." Then she said to the man, "Didyou know it was death to come back to the army?"
"Yes," he said, "I knew it."
"Then why did you do it?"
The man said, quite simply:
"Because it was death. She was all I had. There was nothing left tolove."
"Ah, yes, there was--France! The children of France have always theirmother--they cannot be left with nothing to love. You shall live--and youshall serve France--"
"I will serve you!"
--"you shall fight for France--"
"I will fight for you!"
"You shall be France's soldier--"
"I will be your soldier!"
--"you shall give all your heart to France--"
"I will give all my heart to you--and all my soul, if I have one--and allmy strength, which is great--for I was dead and am alive again; I hadnothing to live for, but now I have! You are France for me. You are myFrance, and I will have no other."
Joan smiled, and was touched and pleased at the man's graveenthusiasm--solemn enthusiasm, one may call it, for the manner of it wasdeeper than mere gravity--and she said:
"Well, it shall be as you will. What are you called?"
The man answered with unsmiling simplicity:
"They call me the Dwarf, but I think it is more in jest than otherwise."
It made Joan laugh, and she said:
"It has something of that look truly! What is the office of that vastax?"
The soldier replied with the same gravity--which must have been born tohim, it sat upon him so naturally:
"It is to persuade persons to respect France."
Joan laughed again, and said:
"Have you given many lessons?"
"Ah, indeed, yes--many."
"The pupils behaved to suit you, afterward?"
"Yes; it made them quiet--quite pleasant and quiet."
"I should think it would happen so. Would you like to be myman-at-arms?--orderly, sentinel, or something like that?"
"If I may!"
"Then you shall. You shall have proper armor, and shall go on teachingyour art. Take one of those led horses there, and follow the staff whenwe move."
That is how we came by the Dwarf; and a good fellow he was. Joan pickedhim out on sight, but it wasn't a mistake; no one could be faithfulerthan he was, and he was a devil and the son of a devil when he turnedhimself loose with his ax. He was so big that he made the Paladin looklike an ordinary man. He liked to like people, therefore people likedhim. He liked us boys from the start; and he liked the knights, and likedpretty much everybody he came across; but he thought more of a paring ofJoan's finger-nail than he did of all the rest of the world put together.
Yes, that is where we got him--stretched on the wain, going to his death,poor chap, and nobody to say a good word for him. He was a good find.Why, the knights treated him almost like an equal--it is the honesttruth; that is the sort of a man he was. They called him the Bastillesometimes, and sometimes they called him Hellfire, which was on accountof his warm and sumptuous style in battle, and you know they wouldn'thave given him pet names if they hadn't had a good deal of affection forhim.
To the Dwarf, Joan was France, the spirit of France made flesh--he nevergot away from that idea that he had started with; and God knows it wasthe true one. That was a humble eye to see so great a truth where someothers failed. To me that seems quite remarkable. And yet, after all, itwas, in a way, just what nations do. When they love a great and noblething, they embody it--they want it so that they can see it with theireyes; like liberty, for instance. They are not content with the cloudyabstract idea, they make a beautiful statue of it, and then their belovedidea is substantial and they can look at it and worship it. And so it isas I say; to the Dwarf, Joan was our country embodied, our country madevisible flesh cast in a gracious form. When she stood before others, theysaw Joan of Arc, but he saw France.
Sometimes he would speak of her by that name. It shows you how the ideawas embedded in his mind, and how real it was to him. The world hascalled our kings by it, but I know of none of them who has had so good aright as she to that sublime title.
When the march past was finished, Joan returned to the front and rode atthe head of the column. When we began to file past those grim bastillesand could glimpse the men within, standing to their guns and ready toempty death into our ranks, such a faintness came over me and such asickness that all things seemed to turn dim and swim before my eyes; andthe other boys looked droopy, too, I thought--including the Paladin,although I do not know this for certain, because he was ahead of me and Ihad to keep my eyes out toward the bastille side, because I could wincebetter when I saw what to wince at.
But Joan was at home--in Paradise, I might say. She sat up straight, andI could see that she was feeling different from me. The awfulest thingwas the silence; there wasn't a sound but the screaking of the saddles,the measured tramplings, and the sneezing of the horses, afflicted by thesmothering dust-clouds which they kicked up. I wanted to sneeze myself,but it seemed to me that I would rather go unsneezed, or suffer even abitterer torture, if there is one, than attract attention to myself.
I was not of a rank to make suggestions, or I would have suggested thatif we went faster we should get by sooner. It seemed to me that it was anill-judged time to be taking a walk. Just as we were drifting in thatsuffocating stillness past a great cannon that stood just within a raisedportcullis, with nothing between me and it but the moat, a most uncommonjackass in there split the world with his bray, and I fell out of thesaddle. Sir Bertrand grabbed me as I went, which was well, for if I hadgone to the ground in my armor I could not have gotten up again bymyself. The English warders on the battlements laughed a coarse laugh,forgetting that every one must begin, and that there had been a time whenthey themselves would have fared no better when shot by a jackass.
The English never uttered a challenge nor fired a shot. It was saidafterward that when their men saw the Maid riding at the front and sawhow lovely she was, their eager courage cooled down in many cases andvanished in the rest, they feeling certain that the creature was notmortal, but the very child of Satan, and so the officers were prudent anddid not try to make them fight. It was said also that some of theofficers were affected by the same superstitious fears. Well, in anycase, they never offered to molest us, and we poked by all the grislyfortresses in peace. During the march I caught up on my devotions, whichwere in arrears; so it was not all loss and no profit for me after all.
It was on this march that the histories say Dunois told Joan that theEnglish were expecting reinforcements under the command of Sir JohnFastolfe, and that she turned upon him and said:
"Bastard, Bastard, in God's name I warn you to let me know of his comingas soon as you hear of it; for if he passes without my knowledge youshall lose your head!"
It may be so; I don't deny it; but I didn't her it. If she really said itI think she only meant she would take off his official head --degrade himfrom his command. It was not like her to threaten a comrade's life. Shedid have her doubts of her generals, and was entitled to them, for shewas all for storm and assault, and they were for holding still and tiringthe English out. Since they did not believe in her way and wereexperienced old soldiers, it would be natural for them to prefer theirown and try to get around carrying hers out.
But I did hear something that the histories didn't mention and don't knowabout. I heard Joan say that now that the garrisons on the other wide hadbeen weakened to strengthen those on our side, the most effective pointof operations had shifted to the south shore; so she meant to go overthere and storm the forts which held the bridge end, and that would openup communication with our own dominions and raise the siege. The generalsbegan to balk, privately, right away, but they only baffled and delayedher, and that for only four days.
All Orleans met the army at the gate and huzzaed it through the banneredstreets to its various quarters, but nobody had to rock it to sleep; itslumped down dog-tired, for Dunois had rushed it without mercy, and forthe next twenty-four hours it would be quiet, all but the snoring.
