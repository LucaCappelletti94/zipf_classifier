The Thames nocturne of blue and goldChanged to a Harmony in grey:A barge with ochre-coloured hayDropt from the wharf: and chill and cold
The yellow fog came creeping downThe bridges, till the houses' wallsSeemed changed to shadows and St. Paul'sLoomed like a bubble o'er the town.
Then suddenly arose the clangOf waking life; the streets were stirredWith country waggons: and a birdFlew to the glistening roofs and sang.
But one pale woman all alone,The daylight kissing her wan hair,Loitered beneath the gas lamps' flare,With lips of flame and heart of stone.
