The Last Doubts Scattered
THIS TIME, as before, the King's last command to the generals was this:"See to it that you do nothing without the sanction of the Maid." Andthis time the command was obeyed; and would continue to be obeyed allthrough the coming great days of the Loire campaign.
That was a change! That was new! It broke the traditions. It shows youwhat sort of a reputation as a commander-in-chief the child had made forherself in ten days in the field. It was a conquering of men's doubts andsuspicions and a capturing and solidifying of men's belief and confidencesuch as the grayest veteran on the Grand Staff had not been able toachieve in thirty years. Don't you remember that when at sixteen Joanconducted her own case in a grim court of law and won it, the old judgespoke of her as "this marvelous child"? It was the right name, you see.
These veterans were not going to branch out and do things without thesanction of the Maid--that is true; and it was a great gain. But at thesame time there were some among them who still trembled at her new anddashing war tactics and earnestly desired to modify them. And so, duringthe 10th, while Joan was slaving away at her plans and issuing orderafter order with tireless industry, the old-time consultations andarguings and speechifyings were going on among certain of the generals.
In the afternoon of that day they came in a body to hold one of thesecouncils of war; and while they waited for Joan to join them theydiscussed the situation. Now this discussion is not set down in thehistories; but I was there, and I will speak of it, as knowing you willtrust me, I not being given to beguiling you with lies.
Gautier de Brusac was spokesman for the timid ones; Joan's side wasresolutely upheld by d'Alencon, the Bastard, La Hire, the Admiral ofFrance, the Marshal de Boussac, and all the other really importantchiefs.
De Brusac argued that the situation was very grave; that Jargeau, thefirst point of attack, was formidably strong; its imposing wallsbristling with artillery; with seven thousand picked English veteransbehind them, and at their head the great Earl of Suffolk and his tworedoubtable brothers, the De la Poles. It seemed to him that the proposalof Joan of Arc to try to take such a place by storm was a most rash andover-daring idea, and she ought to be persuaded to relinquish it in favorof the soberer and safer procedure of investment by regular siege. Itseemed to him that this fiery and furious new fashion of hurling massesof men against impregnable walls of stone, in defiance of the establishedlaws and usages of war, was--
But he got no further. La Hire gave his plumed helm an impatient toss andburst out with:
"By God, she knows her trade, and none can teach it her!"
And before he could get out anything more, D'Alencon was on his feet, andthe Bastard of Orleans, and a half a dozen others, all thundering atonce, and pouring out their indignant displeasure upon any and all thatmid hold, secretly or publicly, distrust of the wisdom of theCommander-in-Chief. And when they had said their say, La Hire took achance again, and said:
"There are some that never know how to change. Circumstances may change,but those people are never able to see that they have got to change too,to meet those circumstances. All that they know is the one beaten trackthat their fathers and grandfathers have followed and that theythemselves have followed in their turn. If an earthquake come and rip theland to chaos, and that beaten track now lead over precipices and intomorasses, those people can't learn that they must strike out a newroad--no; they will march stupidly along and follow the old one, to deathand perdition. Men, there's a new state of things; and a surpassingmilitary genius has perceived it with her clear eye. And a new road isrequired, and that same clear eye has noted where it must go, and hasmarked it out for us. The man does not live, never has lived, never willlive, that can improve upon it! The old state of things was defeat,defeat, defeat--and by consequence we had troops with no dash, no heart,no hope. Would you assault stone walls with such? No--there was but oneway with that kind: sit down before a place and wait, wait--starve itout, if you could. The new case is the very opposite; it is this: men allon fire with pluck and dash and vim and fury and energy--a restrainedconflagration! What would you do with it? Hold it down and let it smolderand perish and go out? What would Joan of Arc do with it? Turn it loose,by the Lord God of heaven and earth, and let it swallow up the foe in thewhirlwind of its fires! Nothing shows the splendor and wisdom of hermilitary genius like her instant comprehension of the size of the changewhich has come about, and her instant perception of the right and onlyright way to take advantage of it. With her is no sitting down andstarving out; no dilly-dallying and fooling around; no lazying, loafing,and going to sleep; no, it is storm! storm! storm! and still storm!storm! storm! and forever storm! storm! storm! hunt the enemy to hishole, then turn her French hurricanes loose and carry him by storm! Andthat is my sort! Jargeau? What of Jargeau, with its battlements andtowers, its devastating artillery, its seven thousand picked veterans?Joan of Arc is to the fore, and by the splendor of God its fate issealed!"
Oh, he carried them. There was not another word said about persuadingJoan to change her tactics. They sat talking comfortably enough afterthat.
By and by Joan entered, and they rose and saluted with their swords, andshe asked what their pleasure might be. La Hire said:
"It is settled, my General. The matter concerned Jargeau. There were somewho thought we could not take the place."
Joan laughed her pleasant laugh, her merry, carefree laugh; the laughthat rippled so buoyantly from her lips and made old people feel youngagain to hear it; and she said to the company:
"Have no fears--indeed, there is no need nor any occasion for them. Wewill strike the English boldly by assault, and you will see." Then afaraway look came into her eyes, and I think that a picture of her homedrifted across the vision of her mind; for she said very gently, and asone who muses, "But that I know God guides us and will give us success, Ihad liefer keep sheep than endure these perils."
We had a homelike farewell supper that evening--just the personal staffand the family. Joan had to miss it; for the city had given a banquet inher honor, and she had gone there in state with the Grand Staff, througha riot of joy-bells and a sparkling Milky Way of illuminations.
After supper some lively young folk whom we knew came in, and wepresently forgot that we were soldiers, and only remembered that we wereboys and girls and full of animal spirits and long-pent fun; and so therewas dancing, and games, and romps, and screams of laughter--just asextravagant and innocent and noisy a good time as ever I had in my life.Dear, dear, how long ago it was!--and I was young then. And outside, allthe while, was the measured tramp of marching battalions, belated oddsand ends of the French power gathering for the morrow's tragedy on thegrim stage of war. Yes, in those days we had those contrasts side byside. And as I passed along to bed there was another one: the big Dwarf,in brave new armor, sat sentry at Joan's door--the stern Spirit of Warmade flesh, as it were--and on his ample shoulder was curled a kittenasleep.
