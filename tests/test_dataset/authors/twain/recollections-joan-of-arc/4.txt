Joan Tames the Mad Man
ALL CHILDREN have nicknames, and we had ours. We got one apiece early,and they stuck to us; but Joan was richer in this matter, for, as timewent on, she earned a second, and then a third, and so on, and we gavethem to her. First and last she had as many as half a dozen. Several ofthese she never lost. Peasant-girls are bashful naturally; but shesurpassed the rule so far, and colored so easily, and was so easilyembarrassed in the presence of strangers, that we nicknamed her theBashful. We were all patriots, but she was called the Patriot, becauseour warmest feeling for our country was cold beside hers. Also she wascalled the Beautiful; and this was not merely because of theextraordinary beauty of her face and form, but because of the lovelinessof her character. These names she kept, and one other--the Brave.
We grew along up, in that plodding and peaceful region, and got to begood-sized boys and girls--big enough, in fact, to begin to know as muchabout the wars raging perpetually to the west and north of us as ourelders, and also to feel as stirred up over the occasional news fromthese red fields as they did. I remember certain of these days veryclearly. One Tuesday a crowd of us were romping and singing around theFairy Tree, and hanging garlands on it in memory of our lost little fairyfriends, when Little Mengette cried out:
"Look! What is that?"
When one exclaims like that in a way that shows astonishment andapprehension, he gets attention. All the panting breasts and flushedfaces flocked together, and all the eager eyes were turned in onedirection--down the slope, toward the village.
"It's a black flag."
"A black flag! No--is it?"
"You can see for yourself that it is nothing else."
"It is a black flag, sure! Now, has any ever seen the like of thatbefore?"
"What can it mean?"
"Mean? It means something dreadful--what else?"
"That is nothing to the point; anybody knows that without the telling.But what?--that is the question."
"It is a chance that he that bears it can answer as well as any that arehere, if you contain yourself till he comes."
"He runs well. Who is it?"
Some named one, some another; but presently all saw that it was EtienneRoze, called the Sunflower, because he had yellow hair and a roundpock-marked face. His ancestors had been Germans some centuries ago. Hecame straining up the slope, now and then projecting his flag-stick aloftand giving his black symbol of woe a wave in the air, whilst all eyeswatched him, all tongues discussed him, and every heart beat faster andfaster with impatience to know his news. At last he sprang among us, andstruck his flag-stick into the ground, saying:
"There! Stand there and represent France while I get my breath. She needsno other flag now."
All the giddy chatter stopped. It was as if one had announced a death. Inthat chilly hush there was no sound audible but the panting of thebreath-blown boy. When he was presently able to speak, he said:
"Black news is come. A treaty has been made at Troyes between France andthe English and Burgundians. By it France is betrayed and delivered over,tied hand and foot, to the enemy. It is the work of the Duke of Burgundyand that she-devil, the Queen of France. It marries Henry of England toCatharine of France--"
"Is not this a lie? Marries the daughter of France to the Butcher ofAgincourt? It is not to be believed. You have not heard aright."
"If you cannot believe that, Jacques d'Arc, then you have a difficulttask indeed before you, for worse is to come. Any child that is born ofthat marriage--if even a girl--is to inherit the thrones of both Englandand France, and this double ownership is to remain with its posterityforever!"
"Now that is certainly a lie, for it runs counter to our Salic law, andso is not legal and cannot have effect," said Edmond Aubrey, called thePaladin, because of the armies he was always going to eat up some day. Hewould have said more, but he was drowned out by the clamors of theothers, who all burst into a fury over this feature of the treaty, alltalking at once and nobody hearing anybody, until presently Haumettepersuaded them to be still, saying:
"It is not fair to break him up so in his tale; pray let him go on. Youfind fault with his history because it seems to be lies. That were reasonfor satisfaction--that kind of lies--not discontent. Tell the rest,Etienne."
"There is but this to tell: Our King, Charles VI., is to reign until hedies, then Henry V. of England is to be Regent of France until a child ofhis shall be old enough to--"
"That man is to reign over us--the Butcher? It is lies! all lies!" criedthe Paladin. "Besides, look you--what becomes of our Dauphin? What saysthe treaty about him?"
"Nothing. It takes away his throne and makes him an outcast."
Then everybody shouted at once and said the news was a lie; and all beganto get cheerful again, saying, "Our King would have to sign the treaty tomake it good; and that he would not do, seeing how it serves his ownson."
But the Sunflower said: "I will ask you this: Would the Queen sign atreaty disinheriting her son?"
"That viper? Certainly. Nobody is talking of her. Nobody expects betterof her. There is no villainy she will stick at, if it feed her spite; andshe hates her son. Her signing it is of no consequence. The King mustsign."
"I will ask you another thing. What is the King's condition? Mad, isn'the?"
"Yes, and his people love him all the more for it. It brings him near tothem by his sufferings; and pitying him makes them love him."
"You say right, Jacques d'Arc. Well, what would you of one that is mad?Does he know what he does? No. Does he do what others make him do? Yes.Now, then, I tell you he has signed the treaty."
"Who made him do it?"
"You know, without my telling. The Queen."
Then there was another uproar--everybody talking at once, and all heapingexecrations upon the Queen's head. Finally Jacques d'Arc said:
"But many reports come that are not true. Nothing so shameful as this hasever come before, nothing that cuts so deep, nothing that has draggedFrance so low; therefore there is hope that this tale is but another idlerumor. Where did you get it?"
The color went out of his sister Joan's face. She dreaded the answer; andher instinct was right.
"The curÂ‚ of Maxey brought it."
There was a general gasp. We knew him, you see, for a trusty man.
"Did he believe it?"
The hearts almost stopped beating. Then came the answer:
"He did. And that is not all. He said he knew it to be true."
Some of the girls began to sob; the boys were struck silent. The distressin Joan's face was like that which one sees in the face of a dumb animalthat has received a mortal hurt. The animal bears it, making nocomplaint; she bore it also, saying no word. Her brother Jacques put hishand on her head and caressed her hair to indicate his sympathy, and shegathered the hand to her lips and kissed it for thanks, not sayinganything. Presently the reaction came, and the boys began to talk. NoelRainguesson said:
"Oh, are we never going to be men! We do grow along so slowly, and Francenever needed soldiers as she needs them now, to wipe out this blackinsult."
"I hate youth!" said Pierre Morel, called the Dragon-fly because his eyesstuck out so. "You've always got to wait, and wait, and wait--and hereare the great wars wasting away for a hundred years, and you never get achance. If I could only be a soldier now!"
"As for me, I'm not going to wait much longer," said the Paladin; "andwhen I do start you'll hear from me, I promise you that. There are somewho, in storming a castle, prefer to be in the rear; but as for me, giveme the front or none; I will have none in front of me but the officers."
Even the girls got the war spirit, and Marie Dupont said:
"I would I were a man; I would start this minute!" and looked very proudof herself, and glanced about for applause.
"So would I," said Cecile Letellier, sniffing the air like a war-horsethat smells the battle; "I warrant you I would not turn back from thefield though all England were in front of me."
"Pooh!" said the Paladin; "girls can brag, but that's all they are goodfor. Let a thousand of them come face to face with a handful of soldiersonce, if you want to see what running is like. Here's little Joan--nextshe'll be threatening to go for a soldier!"
The idea was so funny, and got such a good laugh, that the Paladin gaveit another trial, and said: "Why you can just see her!--see her plungeinto battle like any old veteran. Yes, indeed; and not a poor shabbycommon soldier like us, but an officer--an officer, mind you, with armoron, and the bars of a steel helmet to blush behind and hide herembarrassment when she finds an army in front of her that she hasn't beenintroduced to. An officer? Why, she'll be a captain! A captain, I tellyou, with a hundred men at her back--or maybe girls. Oh, nocommon-soldier business for her! And, dear me, when she starts for thatother army, you'll think there's a hurricane blowing it away!"
Well, he kept it up like that till he made their sides ache withlaughing; which was quite natural, for certainly it was a very funnyidea--at that time--I mean, the idea of that gentle little creature, thatwouldn't hurt a fly, and couldn't bear the sight of blood, and was sogirlish and shrinking in all ways, rushing into battle with a gang ofsoldiers at her back. Poor thing, she sat there confused and ashamed tobe so laughed at; and yet at that very minute there was something aboutto happen which would change the aspect of things, and make those youngpeople see that when it comes to laughing, the person that laughs lasthas the best chance. For just then a face which we all knew and allfeared projected itself from behind the Fairy Tree, and the thought thatshot through us all was, crazy Benoist has gotten loose from his cage,and we are as good as dead! This ragged and hairy and horrible creatureglided out from behind the tree, and raised an ax as he came. We allbroke and fled, this way and that, the girls screaming and crying. No,not all; all but Joan. She stood up and faced the man, and remained so.As we reached the wood that borders the grassy clearing and jumped intoits shelter, two or three of us glanced back to see if Benoist wasgaining on us, and that is what we saw--Joan standing, and the maniacgliding stealthily toward her with his ax lifted. The sight wassickening. We stood where we were, trembling and not able to move. I didnot want to see the murder done, and yet I could not take my eyes away.Now I saw Joan step forward to meet the man, though I believed my eyesmust be deceiving me. Then I saw him stop. He threatened her with his ax,as if to warn her not to come further, but she paid no heed, but wentsteadily on, until she was right in front of him--right under his ax.Then she stopped, and seemed to begin to talk with him. It made me sick,yes, giddy, and everything swam around me, and I could not see anythingfor a time--whether long or brief I do not know. When this passed and Ilooked again, Joan was walking by the man's side toward the village,holding him by his hand. The ax was in her other hand.
One by one the boys and girls crept out, and we stood there gazing,open-mouthed, till those two entered the village and were hid from sight.It was then that we named her the Brave.
We left the black flag there to continue its mournful office, for we hadother matter to think of now. We started for the village on a run, togive warning, and get Joan out of her peril; though for one, after seeingwhat I had seen, it seemed to me that while Joan had the ax the man'schance was not the best of the two. When we arrived the danger was past,the madman was in custody. All the people were flocking to the littlesquare in front of the church to talk and exclaim and wonder over theevent, and it even made the town forget the black news of the treaty fortwo or three hours.
All the women kept hugging and kissing Joan, and praising her, andcrying, and the men patted her on the head and said they wished she was aman, they would send her to the wars and never doubt but that she wouldstrike some blows that would be heard of. She had to tear herself awayand go and hide, this glory was so trying to her diffidence.
Of course the people began to ask us for the particulars. I was soashamed that I made an excuse to the first comer, and got privately awayand went back to the Fairy Tree, to get relief from the embarrassment ofthose questionings. There I found Joan, but she was there to get relieffrom the embarrassment of glory. One by one the others shirked theinquirers and joined us in our refuge. Then we gathered around Joan, andasked her how she had dared to do that thing. She was very modest aboutit, and said:
"You make a great thing of it, but you mistake; it was not a greatmatter. It was not as if I had been a stranger to the man. I know him,and have known him long; and he knows me, and likes me. I have fed himthrough the bars of his cage many times; and last December, when theychopped off two of his fingers to remind him to stop seizing and woundingpeople passing by, I dressed his hand every day till it was well again."
"That is all well enough," said Little Mengette, "but he is a madman,dear, and so his likings and his gratitude and friendliness go fornothing when his rage is up. You did a perilous thing."
"Of course you did," said the Sunflower. "Didn't he threaten to kill youwith the ax?"
"Yes."
"Didn't he threaten you more than once?"
"Yes."
"Didn't you feel afraid?"
"No--at least not much--very little."
"Why didn't you?"
She thought a moment, then said, quite simply:
"I don't know."
It made everybody laugh. Then the Sunflower said it was like a lambtrying to think out how it had come to eat a wolf, but had to give it up.
Cecile Letellier asked, "Why didn't you run when we did?"
"Because it was necessary to get him to his cage; else he would kill someone. Then he would come to the like harm himself."
It is noticeable that this remark, which implies that Joan was entirelyforgetful of herself and her own danger, and had thought and wrought forthe preservation of other people alone, was not challenged, orcriticized, or commented upon by anybody there, but was taken by all asmatter of course and true. It shows how clearly her character wasdefined, and how well it was known and established.
There was silence for a time, and perhaps we were all thinking of thesame thing--namely, what a poor figure we had cut in that adventure ascontrasted with Joan's performance. I tried to think up some good way ofexplaining why I had run away and left a little girl at the mercy of amaniac armed with an ax, but all of the explanations that offeredthemselves to me seemed so cheap and shabby that I gave the matter up andremained still. But others were less wise. Noel Rainguesson fidgetedawhile, then broke out with a remark which showed what his mind had beenrunning on:
"The fact is, I was taken by surprise. That is the reason. If I had had amoment to think, I would no more have thought of running that I wouldthink of running from a baby. For, after all, what is Theophile Benoist,that I should seem to be afraid of him? Pooh! the idea of being afraid ofthat poor thing! I only wish he would come along now--I'd show you!"
"So do I!" cried Pierre Morel. "If I wouldn't make him climb this treequicker than--well, you'd see what I would do! Taking a person bysurprise, that way--why, I never meant to run; not in earnest, I mean. Inever thought of running in earnest; I only wanted to have some fun, andwhen I saw Joan standing there, and him threatening her, it was all Icould do to restrain myself from going there and just tearing the liversand lights out of him. I wanted to do it bad enough, and if it was to doover again, I would! If ever he comes fooling around me again, I'll--"
"Oh, hush!" said the Paladin, breaking in with an air of disdain; "theway you people talk, a person would think there's something heroic aboutstanding up and facing down that poor remnant of a man. Why, it'snothing! There's small glory to be got in facing him down, I should say.Why, I wouldn't want any better fun than to face down a hundred like him.If he was to come along here now, I would walk up to him just as I amnow--I wouldn't care if he had a thousand axes--and say--"
And so he went on and on, telling the brave things he would say and thewonders he would do; and the others put in a word from time to time,describing over again the gory marvels they would do if ever that madmanventured to cross their path again, for next time they would be ready forhim, and would soon teach him that if he thought he could surprise themtwice because he had surprised them once, he would find himself veryseriously mistaken, that's all.
And so, in the end, they all got back their self-respect; yes, and evenadded somewhat to it; indeed when the sitting broke up they had a fineropinion of themselves than they had ever had before.
