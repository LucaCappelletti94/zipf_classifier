They swarmed up in front of Sherburn's palings asthick as they could jam together, and you couldn'thear yourself think for the noise. It was a littletwenty-foot yard. Some sung out "Tear down thefence! tear down the fence!" Then there was aracket of ripping and tearing and smashing, and downshe goes, and the front wall of the crowd begins toroll in like a wave.
Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of hislittle front porch, with a double-barrel gun in his hand,and takes his stand, perfectly ca'm and deliberate, notsaying a word. The racket stopped, and the wavesucked back.
Sherburn never said a word -- just stood there, look-ing down. The stillness was awful creepy and uncom-fortable. Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd;and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyesand looked sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sortof laughed; not the pleasant kind, but the kind thatmakes you feel like when you are eating bread that'sgot sand in it.
Then he says, slow and scornful:
"The idea of YOU lynching anybody! It's amusing.The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough tolynch a MAN! Because you're brave enough to tar andfeather poor friendless cast-out women that come alonghere, did that make you think you had grit enough tolay your hands on a MAN? Why, a MAN'S safe in thehands of ten thousand of your kind -- as long as it'sdaytime and you're not behind him.
"Do I know you? I know you clear throughwas born and raised in the South, and I've lived in theNorth; so I know the average all around. Theaverage man's a coward. In the North he lets anybodywalk over him that wants to, and goes home and praysfor a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one manall by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in thedaytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers callyou a brave people so much that you think you arebraver than any other people -- whereas you're just ASbrave, and no braver. Why don't your juries hangmurderers? Because they're afraid the man's friendswill shoot them in the back, in the dark -- and it's justwhat they WOULD do.
"So they always acquit; and then a MAN goes inthe night, with a hundred masked cowards at his backand lynches the rascal. Your mistake is, that youdidn't bring a man with you; that's one mistake, andthe other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetchyour masks. You brought PART of a man -- BuckHarkness, there -- and if you hadn't had him to startyou, you'd a taken it out in blowing.
"You didn't want to come. The average mandon't like trouble and danger. YOU don't like troubleand danger. But if only HALF a man -- like BuckHarkness, there -- shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!'you're afraid to back down -- afraid you'll be foundout to be what you are -- COWARDS -- and so you raisea yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man'scoat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what bigthings you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out isa mob; that's what an army is -- a mob; they don'tfight with courage that's born in them, but with cour-age that's borrowed from their mass, and from theirofficers. But a mob without any MAN at the head ofit is BENEATH pitifulness. Now the thing for YOU to dois to droop your tails and go home and crawl in ahole. If any real lynching's going to be done it willbe done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when theycome they'll bring their masks, and fetch a MAN along.Now LEAVE -- and take your half-a-man with you" --tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking itwhen he says this.
The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke allapart, and went tearing off every which way, and BuckHarkness he heeled it after them, looking tolerable cheap.I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to.
I went to the circus and loafed around the back sidetill the watchman went by, and then dived in under thetent. I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and someother money, but I reckoned I better save it, becausethere ain't no telling how soon you are going to needit, away from home and amongst strangers that way.You can't be too careful. I ain't opposed to spendingmoney on circuses when there ain't no other way, butthere ain't no use in WASTING it on them.
It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidestsight that ever was when they all come riding in, twoand two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the menjust in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes norstirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easyand comfortable -- there must a been twenty of them-- and every lady with a lovely complexion, and per-fectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of realsure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that costmillions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. Itwas a powerful fine sight; I never see anything solovely. And then one by one they got up and stood,and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle andwavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airyand straight, with their heads bobbing and skimmingalong, away up there under the tent-roof, and everylady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky aroundher hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.
And then faster and faster they went, all of themdancing, first one foot out in the air and then the other,the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmastergoing round and round the center-pole, cracking hiswhip and shouting "Hi! -- hi!" and the clown crack-ing jokes behind him; and by and by all hands droppedthe reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hipsand every gentleman folded his arms, and then howthe horses did lean over and hump themselves! Andso one after the other they all skipped off into thering, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and thenscampered out, and everybody clapped their hands andwent just about wild.
Well, all through the circus they done the mostastonishing things; and all the time that clown carriedon so it most killed the people. The ringmastercouldn't ever say a word to him but he was back athim quick as a wink with the funniest things a bodyever said; and how he ever COULD think of so many ofthem, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn'tnoway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought ofthem in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried toget into the ring -- said he wanted to ride; said hecould ride as well as anybody that ever was. Theyargued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn'tlisten, and the whole show come to a standstill. Thenthe people begun to holler at him and make fun ofhim, and that made him mad, and he begun to ripand tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot ofmen begun to pile down off of the benches and swarmtowards the ring, saying, "Knock him down! throwhim out!" and one or two women begun to scream.So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, andsaid he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and ifthe man would promise he wouldn't make no moretrouble he would let him ride if he thought he couldstay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said allright, and the man got on. The minute he was on,the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavortaround, with two circus men hanging on to his bridletrying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on tohis neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump,and the whole crowd of people standing up shoutingand laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sureenough, all the circus men could do, the horse brokeloose, and away he went like the very nation, roundand round the ring, with that sot laying down on himand hanging to his neck, with first one leg hangingmost to the ground on one side, and then t'other oneon t'other side, and the people just crazy. It warn'tfunny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see hisdanger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddleand grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; andthe next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridleand stood! and the horse a-going like a house afiretoo. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easyand comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his life-- and then he begun to pull off his clothes and slingthem. He shed them so thick they kind of cloggedup the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits.And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, anddressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, andhe lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairlyhum -- and finally skipped off, and made his bow anddanced off to the dressing-room, and everybody justa-howling with pleasure and astonishment.
Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled,and he WAS the sickest ringmaster you ever see, Ireckon. Why, it was one of his own men! He hadgot up that joke all out of his own head, and never leton to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to betook in so, but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster'splace, not for a thousand dollars. I don't know;there may be bullier circuses than what that one was,but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plentygood enough for ME; and wherever I run across it, itcan have all of MY custom every time.
Well, that night we had OUR show; but there warn'tonly about twelve people there -- just enough to payexpenses. And they laughed all the time, and thatmade the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway,before the show was over, but one boy which wasasleep. So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheadscouldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wantedwas low comedy -- and maybe something ruther worsethan low comedy, he reckoned. He said he couldsize their style. So next morning he got some bigsheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, anddrawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all overthe village. The bills said:
            AT THE COURT HOUSE!            FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY!      The World-Renowned Tragedians        DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!                    AND          EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!      Of the London and Continental                 Theatres,      In their Thrilling Tragedy of          THE KING'S CAMELEOPARD,                    OR         THE ROYAL NONESUCH ! ! !            Admission 50 cents.
Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all, whichsaid:
LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED.
"There," says he, "if that line don't fetch them, Idon't know Arkansaw!"
