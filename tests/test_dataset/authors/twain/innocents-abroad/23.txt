The Venetian gondola is as free and graceful, in its gliding movement, asa serpent. It is twenty or thirty feet long, and is narrow and deep,like a canoe; its sharp bow and stern sweep upward from the water likethe horns of a crescent with the abruptness of the curve slightlymodified.
The bow is ornamented with a steel comb with a battle-ax attachment whichthreatens to cut passing boats in two occasionally, but never does. Thegondola is painted black because in the zenith of Venetian magnificencethe gondolas became too gorgeous altogether, and the Senate decreed thatall such display must cease, and a solemn, unembellished black besubstituted. If the truth were known, it would doubtless appear thatrich plebeians grew too prominent in their affectation of patrician showon the Grand Canal, and required a wholesome snubbing. Reverence for thehallowed Past and its traditions keeps the dismal fashion in force nowthat the compulsion exists no longer. So let it remain. It is the colorof mourning. Venice mourns. The stern of the boat is decked over andthe gondolier stands there. He uses a single oar--a long blade, ofcourse, for he stands nearly erect. A wooden peg, a foot and a halfhigh, with two slight crooks or curves in one side of it and one in theother, projects above the starboard gunwale. Against that peg thegondolier takes a purchase with his oar, changing it at intervals to theother side of the peg or dropping it into another of the crooks, as thesteering of the craft may demand--and how in the world he can back andfill, shoot straight ahead, or flirt suddenly around a corner, and makethe oar stay in those insignificant notches, is a problem to me and anever diminishing matter of interest. I am afraid I study thegondolier's marvelous skill more than I do the sculptured palaces weglide among. He cuts a corner so closely, now and then, or missesanother gondola by such an imperceptible hair-breadth that I feel myself"scrooching," as the children say, just as one does when a buggy wheelgrazes his elbow. But he makes all his calculations with the nicestprecision, and goes darting in and out among a Broadway confusion of busycraft with the easy confidence of the educated hackman. He never makes amistake.
Sometimes we go flying down the great canals at such a gait that we canget only the merest glimpses into front doors, and again, in obscurealleys in the suburbs, we put on a solemnity suited to the silence, themildew, the stagnant waters, the clinging weeds, the deserted houses andthe general lifelessness of the place, and move to the spirit of gravemeditation.
The gondolier is a picturesque rascal for all he wears no satin harness,no plumed bonnet, no silken tights. His attitude is stately; he is litheand supple; all his movements are full of grace. When his long canoe,and his fine figure, towering from its high perch on the stern, are cutagainst the evening sky, they make a picture that is very novel andstriking to a foreign eye.
We sit in the cushioned carriage-body of a cabin, with the curtainsdrawn, and smoke, or read, or look out upon the passing boats, thehouses, the bridges, the people, and enjoy ourselves much more than wecould in a buggy jolting over our cobble-stone pavements at home. Thisis the gentlest, pleasantest locomotion we have ever known.
But it seems queer--ever so queer--to see a boat doing duty as a privatecarriage. We see business men come to the front door, step into agondola, instead of a street car, and go off down town to thecounting-room.
We see visiting young ladies stand on the stoop, and laugh, and kissgood-bye, and flirt their fans and say "Come soon--now do--you've beenjust as mean as ever you can be--mother's dying to see you--and we'vemoved into the new house, O such a love of a place!--so convenient to thepost office and the church, and the Young Men's Christian Association;and we do have such fishing, and such carrying on, and suchswimming-matches in the back yard--Oh, you must come--no distance at all,and if you go down through by St. Mark's and the Bridge of Sighs, and cutthrough the alley and come up by the church of Santa Maria dei Frari, andinto the Grand Canal, there isn't a bit of current--now do come, SallyMaria--by-bye!" and then the little humbug trips down the steps, jumpsinto the gondola, says, under her breath, "Disagreeable old thing, I hopeshe won't!" goes skimming away, round the corner; and the other girlslams the street door and says, "Well, that infliction's over, any way,--but I suppose I've got to go and see her--tiresome stuck-up thing!"Human nature appears to be just the same, all over the world. We see thediffident young man, mild of moustache, affluent of hair, indigent ofbrain, elegant of costume, drive up to her father's mansion, tell hishackman to bail out and wait, start fearfully up the steps and meet "theold gentleman" right on the threshold!--hear him ask what street the newBritish Bank is in--as if that were what he came for--and then bounceinto his boat and skurry away with his coward heart in his boots!--seehim come sneaking around the corner again, directly, with a crack of thecurtain open toward the old gentleman's disappearing gondola, and outscampers his Susan with a flock of little Italian endearments flutteringfrom her lips, and goes to drive with him in the watery avenues downtoward the Rialto.
We see the ladies go out shopping, in the most natural way, and flit fromstreet to street and from store to store, just in the good old fashion,except that they leave the gondola, instead of a private carriage,waiting at the curbstone a couple of hours for them,--waiting while theymake the nice young clerks pull down tons and tons of silks and velvetsand moire antiques and those things; and then they buy a paper of pinsand go paddling away to confer the rest of their disastrous patronage onsome other firm. And they always have their purchases sent home just inthe good old way. Human nature is very much the same all over the world;and it is so like my dear native home to see a Venetian lady go into astore and buy ten cents' worth of blue ribbon and have it sent home in ascow. Ah, it is these little touches of nature that move one to tears inthese far-off foreign lands.
We see little girls and boys go out in gondolas with their nurses, for anairing. We see staid families, with prayer-book and beads, enter thegondola dressed in their Sunday best, and float away to church. And atmidnight we see the theatre break up and discharge its swarm of hilariousyouth and beauty; we hear the cries of the hackman-gondoliers, and beholdthe struggling crowd jump aboard, and the black multitude of boats goskimming down the moonlit avenues; we see them separate here and there,and disappear up divergent streets; we hear the faint sounds of laughterand of shouted farewells floating up out of the distance; and then, thestrange pageant being gone, we have lonely stretches of glittering water--of stately buildings--of blotting shadows--of weird stone facescreeping into the moonlight--of deserted bridges--of motionless boats atanchor. And over all broods that mysterious stillness, that stealthyquiet, that befits so well this old dreaming Venice.
We have been pretty much every where in our gondola. We have boughtbeads and photographs in the stores, and wax matches in the Great Squareof St. Mark. The last remark suggests a digression. Every body goes tothis vast square in the evening. The military bands play in the centreof it and countless couples of ladies and gentlemen promenade up and downon either side, and platoons of them are constantly drifting away towardthe old Cathedral, and by the venerable column with the Winged Lion ofSt. Mark on its top, and out to where the boats lie moored; and otherplatoons are as constantly arriving from the gondolas and joining thegreat throng. Between the promenaders and the side-walks are seatedhundreds and hundreds of people at small tables, smoking and takinggranita, (a first cousin to ice-cream;) on the side-walks are moreemploying themselves in the same way. The shops in the first floor ofthe tall rows of buildings that wall in three sides of the square arebrilliantly lighted, the air is filled with music and merry voices, andaltogether the scene is as bright and spirited and full of cheerfulnessas any man could desire. We enjoy it thoroughly. Very many of the youngwomen are exceedingly pretty and dress with rare good taste. We aregradually and laboriously learning the ill-manners of staring themunflinchingly in the face--not because such conduct is agreeable to us,but because it is the custom of the country and they say the girls likeit. We wish to learn all the curious, outlandish ways of all thedifferent countries, so that we can "show off" and astonish people whenwe get home. We wish to excite the envy of our untraveled friends withour strange foreign fashions which we can't shake off. All ourpassengers are paying strict attention to this thing, with the end inview which I have mentioned. The gentle reader will never, never knowwhat a consummate ass he can become, until he goes abroad. I speak now,of course, in the supposition that the gentle reader has not been abroad,and therefore is not already a consummate ass. If the case be otherwise,I beg his pardon and extend to him the cordial hand of fellowship andcall him brother. I shall always delight to meet an ass after my ownheart when I shall have finished my travels.
On this subject let me remark that there are Americans abroad in Italywho have actually forgotten their mother tongue in three months--forgotit in France. They can not even write their address in English in ahotel register. I append these evidences, which I copied verbatim fromthe register of a hotel in a certain Italian city:
 "John P. Whitcomb, Etats Unis.
 "Wm. L. Ainsworth, travailleur (he meant traveler, I suppose,) Etats Unis.
 "George P. Morton et fils, d'Amerique.
 "Lloyd B. Williams, et trois amis, ville de Boston, Amerique.
 "J. Ellsworth Baker, tout de suite de France, place de naissance Amerique, destination la Grand Bretagne."
I love this sort of people. A lady passenger of ours tells of afellow-citizen of hers who spent eight weeks in Paris and then returnedhome and addressed his dearest old bosom friend Herbert as Mr."Er-bare!" He apologized, though, and said, "'Pon my soul it isaggravating, but I cahn't help it--I have got so used to speakingnothing but French, my dear Erbare--damme there it goes again!--got soused to French pronunciation that I cahn't get rid of it--it ispositively annoying, I assure you." This entertaining idiot, whose namewas Gordon, allowed himself to be hailed three times in the streetbefore he paid any attention, and then begged a thousand pardons andsaid he had grown so accustomed to hearing himself addressed as "M'sieuGor-r-dong," with a roll to the r, that he had forgotten the legitimatesound of his name! He wore a rose in his button-hole; he gave the Frenchsalutation--two flips of the hand in front of the face; he called ParisPairree in ordinary English conversation; he carried envelopes bearingforeign postmarks protruding from his breast-pocket; he cultivated amoustache and imperial, and did what else he could to suggest to thebeholder his pet fancy that he resembled Louis Napoleon--and in a spiritof thankfulness which is entirely unaccountable, considering the slimfoundation there was for it, he praised his Maker that he was as he was,and went on enjoying his little life just the same as if he really hadbeen deliberately designed and erected by the great Architect of theUniverse.
Think of our Whitcombs, and our Ainsworths and our Williamses writingthemselves down in dilapidated French in foreign hotel registers! Welaugh at Englishmen, when we are at home, for sticking so sturdily totheir national ways and customs, but we look back upon it from abroadvery forgivingly. It is not pleasant to see an American thrusting hisnationality forward obtrusively in a foreign land, but Oh, it is pitiableto see him making of himself a thing that is neither male nor female,neither fish, flesh, nor fowl--a poor, miserable, hermaphroditeFrenchman!
Among a long list of churches, art galleries, and such things, visited byus in Venice, I shall mention only one--the church of Santa Maria deiFrari. It is about five hundred years old, I believe, and stands ontwelve hundred thousand piles. In it lie the body of Canova and theheart of Titian, under magnificent monuments. Titian died at the age ofalmost one hundred years. A plague which swept away fifty thousand liveswas raging at the time, and there is notable evidence of the reverence inwhich the great painter was held, in the fact that to him alone the statepermitted a public funeral in all that season of terror and death.
In this church, also, is a monument to the doge Foscari, whose name aonce resident of Venice, Lord Byron, has made permanently famous.
The monument to the doge Giovanni Pesaro, in this church, is a curiosityin the way of mortuary adornment. It is eighty feet high and is frontedlike some fantastic pagan temple. Against it stand four colossalNubians, as black as night, dressed in white marble garments. The blacklegs are bare, and through rents in sleeves and breeches, the skin, ofshiny black marble, shows. The artist was as ingenious as his funeraldesigns were absurd. There are two bronze skeletons bearing scrolls, andtwo great dragons uphold the sarcophagus. On high, amid all thisgrotesqueness, sits the departed doge.
In the conventual buildings attached to this church are the statearchives of Venice. We did not see them, but they are said to numbermillions of documents. "They are the records of centuries of the mostwatchful, observant and suspicious government that ever existed--in whichevery thing was written down and nothing spoken out." They fill nearlythree hundred rooms. Among them are manuscripts from the archives ofnearly two thousand families, monasteries and convents. The secrethistory of Venice for a thousand years is here--its plots, its hiddentrials, its assassinations, its commissions of hireling spies and maskedbravoes--food, ready to hand, for a world of dark and mysteriousromances.
Yes, I think we have seen all of Venice. We have seen, in these oldchurches, a profusion of costly and elaborate sepulchre ornamentationsuch as we never dreampt of before. We have stood in the dim religiouslight of these hoary sanctuaries, in the midst of long ranks of dustymonuments and effigies of the great dead of Venice, until we seemeddrifting back, back, back, into the solemn past, and looking upon thescenes and mingling with the peoples of a remote antiquity. We have beenin a half-waking sort of dream all the time. I do not know how else todescribe the feeling. A part of our being has remained still in thenineteenth century, while another part of it has seemed in someunaccountable way walking among the phantoms of the tenth.
We have seen famous pictures until our eyes are weary with looking atthem and refuse to find interest in them any longer. And what wonder,when there are twelve hundred pictures by Palma the Younger in Venice andfifteen hundred by Tintoretto? And behold there are Titians and theworks of other artists in proportion. We have seen Titian's celebratedCain and Abel, his David and Goliah, his Abraham's Sacrifice. We haveseen Tintoretto's monster picture, which is seventy-four feet long and Ido not know how many feet high, and thought it a very commodious picture.We have seen pictures of martyrs enough, and saints enough, to regeneratethe world. I ought not to confess it, but still, since one has noopportunity in America to acquire a critical judgment in art, and since Icould not hope to become educated in it in Europe in a few short weeks, Imay therefore as well acknowledge with such apologies as may be due, thatto me it seemed that when I had seen one of these martyrs I had seen themall. They all have a marked family resemblance to each other, they dressalike, in coarse monkish robes and sandals, they are all bald headed,they all stand in about the same attitude, and without exception they aregazing heavenward with countenances which the Ainsworths, the Mortons andthe Williamses, et fils, inform me are full of "expression." To me thereis nothing tangible about these imaginary portraits, nothing that I cangrasp and take a living interest in. If great Titian had only beengifted with prophecy, and had skipped a martyr, and gone over to Englandand painted a portrait of Shakspeare, even as a youth, which we could allhave confidence in now, the world down to the latest generations wouldhave forgiven him the lost martyr in the rescued seer. I think posteritycould have spared one more martyr for the sake of a great historicalpicture of Titian's time and painted by his brush--such as Columbusreturning in chains from the discovery of a world, for instance. The oldmasters did paint some Venetian historical pictures, and these we did nottire of looking at, notwithstanding representations of the formalintroduction of defunct doges to the Virgin Mary in regions beyond theclouds clashed rather harshly with the proprieties, it seemed to us.
But humble as we are, and unpretending, in the matter of art, ourresearches among the painted monks and martyrs have not been wholly invain. We have striven hard to learn. We have had some success. We havemastered some things, possibly of trifling import in the eyes of thelearned, but to us they give pleasure, and we take as much pride in ourlittle acquirements as do others who have learned far more, and we loveto display them full as well. When we see a monk going about with a lionand looking tranquilly up to heaven, we know that that is St. Mark. Whenwe see a monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven,trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew. When we seea monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a humanskull beside him, and without other baggage, we know that that is St.Jerome. Because we know that he always went flying light in the matterof baggage. When we see a party looking tranquilly up to heaven,unconscious that his body is shot through and through with arrows, weknow that that is St. Sebastian. When we see other monks lookingtranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask whothose parties are. We do this because we humbly wish to learn. We haveseen thirteen thousand St. Jeromes, and twenty-two thousand St. Marks,and sixteen thousand St. Matthews, and sixty thousand St. Sebastians, andfour millions of assorted monks, undesignated, and we feel encouraged tobelieve that when we have seen some more of these various pictures, andhad a larger experience, we shall begin to take an absorbing interest inthem like our cultivated countrymen from Amerique.
Now it does give me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative wayof the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in theship--friends who do thoroughly and conscientiously appreciate them andare in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures andinferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the factthat I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself. Ibelieve that what I have written and may still write about pictures willgive them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it. I even promised that Iwould hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast. But alas! I nevercould keep a promise. I do not blame myself for this weakness, becausethe fault must lie in my physical organization. It is likely that such avery liberal amount of space was given to the organ which enables me tomake promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them wascrowded out. But I grieve not. I like no half-way things. I had ratherhave one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinarycapacity. I certainly meant to keep that promise, but I find I can notdo it. It is impossible to travel through Italy without speaking ofpictures, and can I see them through others' eyes?
If I did not so delight in the grand pictures that are spread before meevery day of my life by that monarch of all the old masters, Nature, Ishould come to believe, sometimes, that I had in me no appreciation ofthe beautiful, whatsoever.
It seems to me that whenever I glory to think that for once I havediscovered an ancient painting that is beautiful and worthy of allpraise, the pleasure it gives me is an infallible proof that it is not abeautiful picture and not in any wise worthy of commendation. This verything has occurred more times than I can mention, in Venice. In everysingle instance the guide has crushed out my swelling enthusiasm with theremark:
"It is nothing--it is of the Renaissance."
I did not know what in the mischief the Renaissance was, and so always Ihad to simply say,
"Ah! so it is--I had not observed it before."
I could not bear to be ignorant before a cultivated negro, the offspringof a South Carolina slave. But it occurred too often for even myself-complacency, did that exasperating "It is nothing--it is of theRenaissance." I said at last:
"Who is this Renaissance? Where did he come from? Who gave himpermission to cram the Republic with his execrable daubs?"
We learned, then, that Renaissance was not a man; that renaissance was aterm used to signify what was at best but an imperfect rejuvenation ofart. The guide said that after Titian's time and the time of the othergreat names we had grown so familiar with, high art declined; then itpartially rose again--an inferior sort of painters sprang up, and theseshabby pictures were the work of their hands. Then I said, in my heat,that I "wished to goodness high art had declined five hundred yearssooner." The Renaissance pictures suit me very well, though sooth to sayits school were too much given to painting real men and did not indulgeenough in martyrs.
The guide I have spoken of is the only one we have had yet who knew anything. He was born in South Carolina, of slave parents. They came toVenice while he was an infant. He has grown up here. He is welleducated. He reads, writes, and speaks English, Italian, Spanish, andFrench, with perfect facility; is a worshipper of art and thoroughlyconversant with it; knows the history of Venice by heart and never tiresof talking of her illustrious career. He dresses better than any of us,I think, and is daintily polite. Negroes are deemed as good as whitepeople, in Venice, and so this man feels no desire to go back to hisnative land. His judgment is correct.
I have had another shave. I was writing in our front room this afternoonand trying hard to keep my attention on my work and refrain from lookingout upon the canal. I was resisting the soft influences of the climateas well as I could, and endeavoring to overcome the desire to be indolentand happy. The boys sent for a barber. They asked me if I would beshaved. I reminded them of my tortures in Genoa, Milan, Como; of mydeclaration that I would suffer no more on Italian soil. I said "Not anyfor me, if you please."
I wrote on. The barber began on the doctor. I heard him say:
"Dan, this is the easiest shave I have had since we left the ship."
He said again, presently:
"Why Dan, a man could go to sleep with this man shaving him."
Dan took the chair. Then he said:
"Why this is Titian. This is one of the old masters."
I wrote on. Directly Dan said:
"Doctor, it is perfect luxury. The ship's barber isn't any thing tohim."
My rough beard wee distressing me beyond measure. The barber was rollingup his apparatus. The temptation was too strong. I said:
"Hold on, please. Shave me also."
I sat down in the chair and closed my eyes. The barber soaped my face,and then took his razor and gave me a rake that well nigh threw me intoconvulsions. I jumped out of the chair: Dan and the doctor were bothwiping blood off their faces and laughing.
I said it was a mean, disgraceful fraud.
They said that the misery of this shave had gone so far beyond any thingthey had ever experienced before, that they could not bear the idea oflosing such a chance of hearing a cordial opinion from me on the subject.
It was shameful. But there was no help for it. The skinning was begunand had to be finished. The tears flowed with every rake, and so did thefervent execrations. The barber grew confused, and brought blood everytime. I think the boys enjoyed it better than any thing they have seenor heard since they left home.
We have seen the Campanile, and Byron's house and Balbi's the geographer,and the palaces of all the ancient dukes and doges of Venice, and we haveseen their effeminate descendants airing their nobility in fashionableFrench attire in the Grand Square of St. Mark, and eating ices anddrinking cheap wines, instead of wearing gallant coats of mail anddestroying fleets and armies as their great ancestors did in the days ofVenetian glory. We have seen no bravoes with poisoned stilettos, nomasks, no wild carnival; but we have seen the ancient pride of Venice,the grim Bronze Horses that figure in a thousand legends. Venice maywell cherish them, for they are the only horses she ever had. It is saidthere are hundreds of people in this curious city who never have seen aliving horse in their lives. It is entirely true, no doubt.
And so, having satisfied ourselves, we depart to-morrow, and leave thevenerable Queen of the Republics to summon her vanished ships, andmarshal her shadowy armies, and know again in dreams the pride of her oldrenown.
