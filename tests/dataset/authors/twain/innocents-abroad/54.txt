We were standing in a narrow street, by the Tower of Antonio. "On thesestones that are crumbling away," the guide said, "the Saviour sat andrested before taking up the cross. This is the beginning of theSorrowful Way, or the Way of Grief." The party took note of the sacredspot, and moved on. We passed under the "Ecce Homo Arch," and saw thevery window from which Pilate's wife warned her husband to have nothingto do with the persecution of the Just Man. This window is in anexcellent state of preservation, considering its great age. They showedus where Jesus rested the second time, and where the mob refused to givehim up, and said, "Let his blood be upon our heads, and upon ourchildren's children forever." The French Catholics are building a churchon this spot, and with their usual veneration for historical relics, areincorporating into the new such scraps of ancient walls as they havefound there. Further on, we saw the spot where the fainting Saviour fellunder the weight of his cross. A great granite column of some ancienttemple lay there at the time, and the heavy cross struck it such a blowthat it broke in two in the middle. Such was the guide's story when hehalted us before the broken column.
We crossed a street, and came presently to the former residence of St.Veronica. When the Saviour passed there, she came out, full of womanlycompassion, and spoke pitying words to him, undaunted by the hootings andthe threatenings of the mob, and wiped the perspiration from his facewith her handkerchief. We had heard so much of St. Veronica, and seenher picture by so many masters, that it was like meeting an old friendunexpectedly to come upon her ancient home in Jerusalem. The strangestthing about the incident that has made her name so famous, is, that whenshe wiped the perspiration away, the print of the Saviour's face remainedupon the handkerchief, a perfect portrait, and so remains unto this day.We knew this, because we saw this handkerchief in a cathedral in Paris,in another in Spain, and in two others in Italy. In the Milan cathedralit costs five francs to see it, and at St. Peter's, at Rome, it is almostimpossible to see it at any price. No tradition is so amply verified asthis of St. Veronica and her handkerchief.
At the next corner we saw a deep indention in the hard stone masonry ofthe corner of a house, but might have gone heedlessly by it but that theguide said it was made by the elbow of the Saviour, who stumbled here andfell. Presently we came to just such another indention in a stone wall.The guide said the Saviour fell here, also, and made this depression withhis elbow.
There were other places where the Lord fell, and others where he rested;but one of the most curious landmarks of ancient history we found on thismorning walk through the crooked lanes that lead toward Calvary, was acertain stone built into a house--a stone that was so seamed and scarredthat it bore a sort of grotesque resemblance to the human face. Theprojections that answered for cheeks were worn smooth by the passionatekisses of generations of pilgrims from distant lands. We asked "Why?"The guide said it was because this was one of "the very stones ofJerusalem" that Christ mentioned when he was reproved for permitting thepeople to cry "Hosannah!" when he made his memorable entry into thecity upon an ass. One of the pilgrims said, "But there is no evidencethat the stones did cry out--Christ said that if the people stopped fromshouting Hosannah, the very stones would do it." The guide was perfectlyserene. He said, calmly, "This is one of the stones that would havecried out." It was of little use to try to shake this fellow's simplefaith--it was easy to see that.
And so we came at last to another wonder, of deep and abiding interest--the veritable house where the unhappy wretch once lived who has beencelebrated in song and story for more than eighteen hundred years as theWandering Jew. On the memorable day of the Crucifixion he stood in thisold doorway with his arms akimbo, looking out upon the struggling mobthat was approaching, and when the weary Saviour would have sat down andrested him a moment, pushed him rudely away and said, "Move on!" TheLord said, "Move on, thou, likewise," and the command has never beenrevoked from that day to this. All men know how that the miscreant uponwhose head that just curse fell has roamed up and down the wide world,for ages and ages, seeking rest and never finding it--courting death butalways in vain--longing to stop, in city, in wilderness, in desertsolitudes, yet hearing always that relentless warning to march--march on!They say--do these hoary traditions--that when Titus sacked Jerusalem andslaughtered eleven hundred thousand Jews in her streets and by-ways, theWandering Jew was seen always in the thickest of the fight, and that whenbattle-axes gleamed in the air, he bowed his head beneath them; whenswords flashed their deadly lightnings, he sprang in their way; he baredhis breast to whizzing javelins, to hissing arrows, to any and to everyweapon that promised death and forgetfulness, and rest. But it wasuseless--he walked forth out of the carnage without a wound. And it issaid that five hundred years afterward he followed Mahomet when hecarried destruction to the cities of Arabia, and then turned against him,hoping in this way to win the death of a traitor. His calculations werewrong again. No quarter was given to any living creature but one, andthat was the only one of all the host that did not want it. He soughtdeath five hundred years later, in the wars of the Crusades, and offeredhimself to famine and pestilence at Ascalon. He escaped again--he couldnot die. These repeated annoyances could have at last but one effect--they shook his confidence. Since then the Wandering Jew has carried on akind of desultory toying with the most promising of the aids andimplements of destruction, but with small hope, as a general thing. Hehas speculated some in cholera and railroads, and has taken almost alively interest in infernal machines and patent medicines. He is old,now, and grave, as becomes an age like his; he indulges in no lightamusements save that he goes sometimes to executions, and is fond offunerals.
There is one thing he can not avoid; go where he will about the world, hemust never fail to report in Jerusalem every fiftieth year. Only a yearor two ago he was here for the thirty-seventh time since Jesus wascrucified on Calvary. They say that many old people, who are here now,saw him then, and had seen him before. He looks always the same--old,and withered, and hollow-eyed, and listless, save that there is about himsomething which seems to suggest that he is looking for some one,expecting some one--the friends of his youth, perhaps. But the most ofthem are dead, now. He always pokes about the old streets lookinglonesome, making his mark on a wall here and there, and eyeing the oldestbuildings with a sort of friendly half interest; and he sheds a few tearsat the threshold of his ancient dwelling, and bitter, bitter tears theyare. Then he collects his rent and leaves again. He has been seenstanding near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on many a starlight night,for he has cherished an idea for many centuries that if he could onlyenter there, he could rest. But when he approaches, the doors slam towith a crash, the earth trembles, and all the lights in Jerusalem burn aghastly blue! He does this every fifty years, just the same. It ishopeless, but then it is hard to break habits one has been eighteenhundred years accustomed to. The old tourist is far away on hiswanderings, now. How he must smile to see a pack of blockheads like us,galloping about the world, and looking wise, and imagining we are findingout a good deal about it! He must have a consuming contempt for theignorant, complacent asses that go skurrying about the world in theserailroading days and call it traveling.
When the guide pointed out where the Wandering Jew had left his familiarmark upon a wall, I was filled with astonishment. It read:
 "S. T.--1860--X."
All I have revealed about the Wandering Jew can be amply proven byreference to our guide.
The mighty Mosque of Omar, and the paved court around it, occupy a fourthpart of Jerusalem. They are upon Mount Moriah, where King Solomon'sTemple stood. This Mosque is the holiest place the Mohammedan knows,outside of Mecca. Up to within a year or two past, no Christian couldgain admission to it or its court for love or money. But the prohibitionhas been removed, and we entered freely for bucksheesh.
I need not speak of the wonderful beauty and the exquisite grace andsymmetry that have made this Mosque so celebrated--because I did not seethem. One can not see such things at an instant glance--one frequentlyonly finds out how really beautiful a really beautiful woman is afterconsiderable acquaintance with her; and the rule applies to NiagaraFalls, to majestic mountains and to mosques--especially to mosques.
The great feature of the Mosque of Omar is the prodigious rock in thecentre of its rotunda. It was upon this rock that Abraham came so nearoffering up his son Isaac--this, at least, is authentic--it is very muchmore to be relied on than most of the traditions, at any rate. On thisrock, also, the angel stood and threatened Jerusalem, and David persuadedhim to spare the city. Mahomet was well acquainted with this stone.From it he ascended to heaven. The stone tried to follow him, and if theangel Gabriel had not happened by the merest good luck to be there toseize it, it would have done it. Very few people have a grip likeGabriel--the prints of his monstrous fingers, two inches deep, are to beseen in that rock to-day.
This rock, large as it is, is suspended in the air. It does not touchany thing at all. The guide said so. This is very wonderful. In theplace on it where Mahomet stood, he left his foot-prints in the solidstone. I should judge that he wore about eighteens. But what I wasgoing to say, when I spoke of the rock being suspended, was, that in thefloor of the cavern under it they showed us a slab which they saidcovered a hole which was a thing of extraordinary interest to allMohammedans, because that hole leads down to perdition, and every soulthat is transferred from thence to Heaven must pass up through thisorifice. Mahomet stands there and lifts them out by the hair. AllMohammedans shave their heads, but they are careful to leave a lock ofhair for the Prophet to take hold of. Our guide observed that a goodMohammedan would consider himself doomed to stay with the damned foreverif he were to lose his scalp-lock and die before it grew again. The mostof them that I have seen ought to stay with the damned, any how, withoutreference to how they were barbered.
For several ages no woman has been allowed to enter the cavern where thatimportant hole is. The reason is that one of the sex was once caughtthere blabbing every thing she knew about what was going on above ground,to the rapscallions in the infernal regions down below. She carried hergossiping to such an extreme that nothing could be kept private--nothingcould be done or said on earth but every body in perdition knew all aboutit before the sun went down. It was about time to suppress this woman'stelegraph, and it was promptly done. Her breath subsided about the sametime.
The inside of the great mosque is very showy with variegated marble wallsand with windows and inscriptions of elaborate mosaic. The Turks havetheir sacred relics, like the Catholics. The guide showed us theveritable armor worn by the great son-in-law and successor of Mahomet,and also the buckler of Mahomet's uncle. The great iron railing whichsurrounds the rock was ornamented in one place with a thousand rags tiedto its open work. These are to remind Mahomet not to forget theworshipers who placed them there. It is considered the next best thingto tying threads around his finger by way of reminders.
Just outside the mosque is a miniature temple, which marks the spot whereDavid and Goliah used to sit and judge the people.--[A pilgrim informsme that it was not David and Goliah, but David and Saul. I stick to myown statement--the guide told me, and he ought to know.]
Every where about the Mosque of Omar are portions of pillars, curiouslywrought altars, and fragments of elegantly carved marble--preciousremains of Solomon's Temple. These have been dug from all depths in thesoil and rubbish of Mount Moriah, and the Moslems have always shown adisposition to preserve them with the utmost care. At that portion ofthe ancient wall of Solomon's Temple which is called the Jew's Place ofWailing, and where the Hebrews assemble every Friday to kiss thevenerated stones and weep over the fallen greatness of Zion, any one cansee a part of the unquestioned and undisputed Temple of Solomon, the sameconsisting of three or four stones lying one upon the other, each ofwhich is about twice as long as a seven-octave piano, and about as thickas such a piano is high. But, as I have remarked before, it is only ayear or two ago that the ancient edict prohibiting Christian rubbish likeourselves to enter the Mosque of Omar and see the costly marbles thatonce adorned the inner Temple was annulled. The designs wrought uponthese fragments are all quaint and peculiar, and so the charm of noveltyis added to the deep interest they naturally inspire. One meets withthese venerable scraps at every turn, especially in the neighboringMosque el Aksa, into whose inner walls a very large number of them arecarefully built for preservation. These pieces of stone, stained anddusty with age, dimly hint at a grandeur we have all been taught toregard as the princeliest ever seen on earth; and they call up picturesof a pageant that is familiar to all imaginations--camels laden withspices and treasure--beautiful slaves, presents for Solomon's harem--along cavalcade of richly caparisoned beasts and warriors--and Sheba'sQueen in the van of this vision of "Oriental magnificence." Theseelegant fragments bear a richer interest than the solemn vastness of thestones the Jews kiss in the Place of Wailing can ever have for theheedless sinner.
Down in the hollow ground, underneath the olives and the orange-treesthat flourish in the court of the great Mosque, is a wilderness ofpillars--remains of the ancient Temple; they supported it. There areponderous archways down there, also, over which the destroying "plough"of prophecy passed harmless. It is pleasant to know we are disappointed,in that we never dreamed we might see portions of the actual Temple ofSolomon, and yet experience no shadow of suspicion that they were amonkish humbug and a fraud.
We are surfeited with sights. Nothing has any fascination for us, now,but the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. We have been there every day, andhave not grown tired of it; but we are weary of every thing else. Thesights are too many. They swarm about you at every step; no single footof ground in all Jerusalem or within its neighborhood seems to be withouta stirring and important history of its own. It is a very relief tosteal a walk of a hundred yards without a guide along to talk unceasinglyabout every stone you step upon and drag you back ages and ages to theday when it achieved celebrity.
It seems hardly real when I find myself leaning for a moment on a ruinedwall and looking listlessly down into the historic pool of Bethesda. Idid not think such things could be so crowded together as to diminishtheir interest. But in serious truth, we have been drifting about, forseveral days, using our eyes and our ears more from a sense of duty thanany higher and worthier reason. And too often we have been glad when itwas time to go home and be distressed no more about illustriouslocalities.
Our pilgrims compress too much into one day. One can gorge sights torepletion as well as sweetmeats. Since we breakfasted, this morning, wehave seen enough to have furnished us food for a year's reflection if wecould have seen the various objects in comfort and looked upon themdeliberately. We visited the pool of Hezekiah, where David saw Uriah'swife coming from the bath and fell in love with her.
We went out of the city by the Jaffa gate, and of course were told manythings about its Tower of Hippicus.
We rode across the Valley of Hinnom, between two of the Pools of Gihon,and by an aqueduct built by Solomon, which still conveys water to thecity. We ascended the Hill of Evil Counsel, where Judas received histhirty pieces of silver, and we also lingered a moment under the tree avenerable tradition says he hanged himself on.
We descended to the canon again, and then the guide began to give nameand history to every bank and boulder we came to: "This was the Field ofBlood; these cuttings in the rocks were shrines and temples of Moloch;here they sacrificed children; yonder is the Zion Gate; the TyropeanValley, the Hill of Ophel; here is the junction of the Valley ofJehoshaphat--on your right is the Well of Job." We turned upJehoshaphat. The recital went on. "This is the Mount of Olives; this isthe Hill of Offense; the nest of huts is the Village of Siloam; here,yonder, every where, is the King's Garden; under this great treeZacharias, the high priest, was murdered; yonder is Mount Moriah and theTemple wall; the tomb of Absalom; the tomb of St. James; the tomb ofZacharias; beyond, are the Garden of Gethsemane and the tomb of theVirgin Mary; here is the Pool of Siloam, and----"
We said we would dismount, and quench our thirst, and rest. We wereburning up with the heat. We were failing under the accumulated fatigueof days and days of ceaseless marching. All were willing.
The Pool is a deep, walled ditch, through which a clear stream of waterruns, that comes from under Jerusalem somewhere, and passing through theFountain of the Virgin, or being supplied from it, reaches this place byway of a tunnel of heavy masonry. The famous pool looked exactly as itlooked in Solomon's time, no doubt, and the same dusky, Oriental women,came down in their old Oriental way, and carried off jars of the water ontheir heads, just as they did three thousand years ago, and just as theywill do fifty thousand years hence if any of them are still left onearth.
We went away from there and stopped at the Fountain of the Virgin. Butthe water was not good, and there was no comfort or peace any where, onaccount of the regiment of boys and girls and beggars that persecuted usall the time for bucksheesh. The guide wanted us to give them somemoney, and we did it; but when he went on to say that they were starvingto death we could not but feel that we had done a great sin in throwingobstacles in the way of such a desirable consummation, and so we tried tocollect it back, but it could not be done.
We entered the Garden of Gethsemane, and we visited the Tomb of theVirgin, both of which we had seen before. It is not meet that I shouldspeak of them now. A more fitting time will come.
I can not speak now of the Mount of Olives or its view of Jerusalem, theDead Sea and the mountains of Moab; nor of the Damascus Gate or the treethat was planted by King Godfrey of Jerusalem. One ought to feelpleasantly when he talks of these things. I can not say any thing aboutthe stone column that projects over Jehoshaphat from the Temple wall likea cannon, except that the Moslems believe Mahomet will sit astride of itwhen he comes to judge the world. It is a pity he could not judge itfrom some roost of his own in Mecca, without trespassing on our holyground. Close by is the Golden Gate, in the Temple wall--a gate that wasan elegant piece of sculpture in the time of the Temple, and is even soyet. From it, in ancient times, the Jewish High Priest turned loose thescapegoat and let him flee to the wilderness and bear away histwelve-month load of the sins of the people. If they were to turn oneloose now, he would not get as far as the Garden of Gethsemane, tillthese miserable vagabonds here would gobble him up,--[Favorite pilgrimexpression.]--sins and all. They wouldn't care. Mutton-chops and sinis good enough living for them. The Moslems watch the Golden Gate witha jealous eye, and an anxious one, for they have an honored traditionthat when it falls, Islamism will fall and with it the Ottoman Empire.It did not grieve me any to notice that the old gate was getting alittle shaky.
We are at home again. We are exhausted. The sun has roasted us, almost.We have full comfort in one reflection, however. Our experiences inEurope have taught us that in time this fatigue will be forgotten; theheat will be forgotten; the thirst, the tiresome volubility of the guide,the persecutions of the beggars--and then, all that will be left will bepleasant memories of Jerusalem, memories we shall call up with alwaysincreasing interest as the years go by, memories which some day willbecome all beautiful when the last annoyance that incumbers them shallhave faded out of our minds never again to return. School-boy days areno happier than the days of after life, but we look back upon themregretfully because we have forgotten our punishments at school, and howwe grieved when our marbles were lost and our kites destroyed--because wehave forgotten all the sorrows and privations of that canonized epoch andremember only its orchard robberies, its wooden sword pageants and itsfishing holydays. We are satisfied. We can wait. Our reward will come.To us, Jerusalem and to-day's experiences will be an enchanted memory ayear hence--memory which money could not buy from us.
