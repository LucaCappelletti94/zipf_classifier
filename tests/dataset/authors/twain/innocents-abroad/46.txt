About an hour's ride over a rough, rocky road, half flooded with water,and through a forest of oaks of Bashan, brought us to Dan.
From a little mound here in the plain issues a broad stream of limpidwater and forms a large shallow pool, and then rushes furiously onward,augmented in volume.  This puddle is an important source of the Jordan.Its banks, and those of the brook are respectably adorned with bloomingoleanders, but the unutterable beauty of the spot will not throw awell-balanced man into convulsions, as the Syrian books of travel wouldlead one to suppose.
From the spot I am speaking of, a cannon-ball would carry beyond theconfines of Holy Land and light upon profane ground three miles away.We were only one little hour's travel within the borders of Holy Land--wehad hardly begun to appreciate yet that we were standing upon anydifferent sort of earth than that we had always been used to, and see howthe historic names began already to cluster!  Dan--Bashan--Lake Huleh--the Sources of Jordan--the Sea of Galilee.  They were all in sight butthe last, and it was not far away.  The little township of Bashan wasonce the kingdom so famous in Scripture for its bulls and its oaks.Lake Huleh is the Biblical "Waters of Merom."  Dan was the northern andBeersheba the southern limit of Palestine--hence the expression "from Danto Beersheba."  It is equivalent to our phrases "from Maine to Texas"--"from Baltimore to San Francisco."  Our expression and that of theIsraelites both mean the same--great distance.  With their slow camelsand asses, it was about a seven days' journey from Dan to Beersheba---saya hundred and fifty or sixty miles--it was the entire length of theircountry, and was not to be undertaken without great preparation and muchceremony.  When the Prodigal traveled to "a far country," it is notlikely that he went more than eighty or ninety miles.  Palestine is onlyfrom forty to sixty miles wide.  The State of Missouri could be splitinto three Palestines, and there would then be enough material left forpart of another--possibly a whole one.  From Baltimore to San Franciscois several thousand miles, but it will be only a seven days' journey inthe cars when I am two or three years older.--[The railroad has beencompleted since the above was written.]--If I live I shall necessarilyhave to go across the continent every now and then in those cars, but onejourney from Dan to Beersheba will be sufficient, no doubt.  It must bethe most trying of the two.  Therefore, if we chance to discover thatfrom Dan to Beersheba seemed a mighty stretch of country to theIsraelites, let us not be airy with them, but reflect that it was and isa mighty stretch when one can not traverse it by rail.
The small mound I have mentioned a while ago was once occupied by thePhenician city of Laish.  A party of filibusters from Zorah and Escholcaptured the place, and lived there in a free and easy way, worshipinggods of their own manufacture and stealing idols from their neighborswhenever they wore their own out.  Jeroboam set up a golden calf here tofascinate his people and keep them from making dangerous trips toJerusalem to worship, which might result in a return to their rightfulallegiance.  With all respect for those ancient Israelites, I can notoverlook the fact that they were not always virtuous enough to withstandthe seductions of a golden calf.  Human nature has not changed much sincethen.
Some forty centuries ago the city of Sodom was pillaged by the Arabprinces of Mesopotamia, and among other prisoners they seized upon thepatriarch Lot and brought him here on their way to their own possessions.They brought him to Dan, and father Abraham, who was pursuing them, creptsoftly in at dead of night, among the whispering oleanders and under theshadows of the stately oaks, and fell upon the slumbering victors andstartled them from their dreams with the clash of steel.  He recapturedLot and all the other plunder.
We moved on.  We were now in a green valley, five or six miles wide andfifteen long.  The streams which are called the sources of the Jordanflow through it to Lake Huleh, a shallow pond three miles in diameter,and from the southern extremity of the Lake the concentrated Jordan flowsout.  The Lake is surrounded by a broad marsh, grown with reeds.  Betweenthe marsh and the mountains which wall the valley is a respectable stripof fertile land; at the end of the valley, toward Dan, as much as halfthe land is solid and fertile, and watered by Jordan's sources.  There isenough of it to make a farm.  It almost warrants the enthusiasm of thespies of that rabble of adventurers who captured Dan.  They said: "Wehave seen the land, and behold it is very good.  * * *  A place wherethere is no want of any thing that is in the earth."
Their enthusiasm was at least warranted by the fact that they had neverseen a country as good as this.  There was enough of it for the amplesupport of their six hundred men and their families, too.
When we got fairly down on the level part of the Danite farm, we came toplaces where we could actually run our horses.  It was a notablecircumstance.
We had been painfully clambering over interminable hills and rocks fordays together, and when we suddenly came upon this astonishing piece ofrockless plain, every man drove the spurs into his horse and sped awaywith a velocity he could surely enjoy to the utmost, but could never hopeto comprehend in Syria.
Here were evidences of cultivation--a rare sight in this country--an acreor two of rich soil studded with last season's dead corn-stalks of thethickness of your thumb and very wide apart.  But in such a land it was athrilling spectacle.  Close to it was a stream, and on its banks a greatherd of curious-looking Syrian goats and sheep were gratefully eatinggravel.  I do not state this as a petrified fact--I only suppose theywere eating gravel, because there did not appear to be any thing else forthem to eat.  The shepherds that tended them were the very pictures ofJoseph and his brethren I have no doubt in the world.  They were tall,muscular, and very dark-skinned Bedouins, with inky black beards.  Theyhad firm lips, unquailing eyes, and a kingly stateliness of bearing.They wore the parti-colored half bonnet, half hood, with fringed endsfalling upon their shoulders, and the full, flowing robe barred withbroad black stripes--the dress one sees in all pictures of the swarthysons of the desert.  These chaps would sell their younger brothers ifthey had a chance, I think.  They have the manners, the customs, thedress, the occupation and the loose principles of the ancient stock.[They attacked our camp last night, and I bear them no good will.]They had with them the pigmy jackasses one sees all over Syria andremembers in all pictures of the "Flight into Egypt," where Mary and theYoung Child are riding and Joseph is walking alongside, towering highabove the little donkey's shoulders.
But really, here the man rides and carries the child, as a general thing,and the woman walks.  The customs have not changed since Joseph's time.We would not have in our houses a picture representing Joseph riding andMary walking; we would see profanation in it, but a Syrian Christianwould not.  I know that hereafter the picture I first spoke of will lookodd to me.
We could not stop to rest two or three hours out from our camp, ofcourse, albeit the brook was beside us.  So we went on an hour longer.We saw water, then, but nowhere in all the waste around was there a footof shade, and we were scorching to death.  "Like unto the shadow of agreat rock in a weary land."  Nothing in the Bible is more beautiful thanthat, and surely there is no place we have wandered to that is able togive it such touching expression as this blistering, naked, treelessland.
Here you do not stop just when you please, but when you can.  We foundwater, but no shade.  We traveled on and found a tree at last, but nowater.  We rested and lunched, and came on to this place, Ain Mellahah(the boys call it Baldwinsville.) It was a very short day's run, but thedragoman does not want to go further, and has invented a plausible lieabout the country beyond this being infested by ferocious Arabs, whowould make sleeping in their midst a dangerous pastime.  Well, they oughtto be dangerous.  They carry a rusty old weather-beaten flint-lock gun,with a barrel that is longer than themselves; it has no sights on it, itwill not carry farther than a brickbat, and is not half so certain.  Andthe great sash they wear in many a fold around their waists has two orthree absurd old horse-pistols in it that are rusty from eternal disuse--weapons that would hang fire just about long enough for you to walk outof range, and then burst and blow the Arab's head off.  Exceedinglydangerous these sons of the desert are.
It used to make my blood run cold to read Wm. C. Grimes' hairbreadthescapes from Bedouins, but I think I could read them now without atremor.  He never said he was attacked by Bedouins, I believe, or wasever treated uncivilly, but then in about every other chapter hediscovered them approaching, any how, and he had a blood-curdling fashionof working up the peril; and of wondering how his relations far awaywould feel could they see their poor wandering boy, with his weary feetand his dim eyes, in such fearful danger; and of thinking for the lasttime of the old homestead, and the dear old church, and the cow, andthose things; and of finally straightening his form to its utmost heightin the saddle, drawing his trusty revolver, and then dashing the spursinto "Mohammed" and sweeping down upon the ferocious enemy determined tosell his life as dearly as possible.  True the Bedouins never did anything to him when he arrived, and never had any intention of doing anything to him in the first place, and wondered what in the mischief he wasmaking all that to-do about; but still I could not divest myself of theidea, somehow, that a frightful peril had been escaped through that man'sdare-devil bravery, and so I never could read about Wm. C. Grimes'Bedouins and sleep comfortably afterward.  But I believe the Bedouins tobe a fraud, now.  I have seen the monster, and I can outrun him.  I shallnever be afraid of his daring to stand behind his own gun and dischargeit.
About fifteen hundred years before Christ, this camp-ground of ours bythe Waters of Merom was the scene of one of Joshua's exterminatingbattles.  Jabin, King of Hazor, (up yonder above Dan,) called all thesheiks about him together, with their hosts, to make ready for Israel'sterrible General who was approaching.
     "And when all these Kings were met together, they came and pitched     together by the Waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.  And they     went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as     the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude," etc.
But Joshua fell upon them and utterly destroyed them, root and branch.That was his usual policy in war.  He never left any chance for newspapercontroversies about who won the battle.  He made this valley, so quietnow, a reeking slaughter-pen.
Somewhere in this part of the country--I do not know exactly where--Israel fought another bloody battle a hundred years later.  Deborah, theprophetess, told Barak to take ten thousand men and sally forth againstanother King Jabin who had been doing something.  Barak came down fromMount Tabor, twenty or twenty-five miles from here, and gave battle toJabin's forces, who were in command of Sisera.  Barak won the fight, andwhile he was making the victory complete by the usual method ofexterminating the remnant of the defeated host, Sisera fled away on foot,and when he was nearly exhausted by fatigue and thirst, one Jael, a womanhe seems to have been acquainted with, invited him to come into her tentand rest himself.  The weary soldier acceded readily enough, and Jael puthim to bed.  He said he was very thirsty, and asked his generouspreserver to get him a cup of water.  She brought him some milk, and hedrank of it gratefully and lay down again, to forget in pleasant dreamshis lost battle and his humbled pride.  Presently when he was asleep shecame softly in with a hammer and drove a hideous tent-pen down throughhis brain!
"For he was fast asleep and weary.  So he died."  Such is the touchinglanguage of the Bible.  "The Song of Deborah and Barak" praises Jael forthe memorable service she had rendered, in an exultant strain:
     "Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,     blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
     "He asked for water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter     in a lordly dish.
     "She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's     hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head     when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
     "At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,     he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead."
Stirring scenes like these occur in this valley no more.  There is not asolitary village throughout its whole extent--not for thirty miles ineither direction.  There are two or three small clusters of Bedouintents, but not a single permanent habitation.  One may ride ten miles,hereabouts, and not see ten human beings.
To this region one of the prophecies is applied:
     "I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies which dwell     therein shall be astonished at it.  And I will scatter you among the     heathen, and I will draw out a sword after you; and your land shall     be desolate and your cities waste."
No man can stand here by deserted Ain Mellahah and say the prophecy hasnot been fulfilled.
In a verse from the Bible which I have quoted above, occurs the phrase"all these kings."  It attracted my attention in a moment, because itcarries to my mind such a vastly different significance from what italways did at home.  I can see easily enough that if I wish to profit bythis tour and come to a correct understanding of the matters of interestconnected with it, I must studiously and faithfully unlearn a great manythings I have somehow absorbed concerning Palestine.  I must begin asystem of reduction.  Like my grapes which the spies bore out of thePromised Land, I have got every thing in Palestine on too large a scale.Some of my ideas were wild enough.  The word Palestine always brought tomy mind a vague suggestion of a country as large as the United States.I do not know why, but such was the case.  I suppose it was because Icould not conceive of a small country having so large a history.  I thinkI was a little surprised to find that the grand Sultan of Turkey was aman of only ordinary size.  I must try to reduce my ideas of Palestine toa more reasonable shape.  One gets large impressions in boyhood,sometimes, which he has to fight against all his life.  "All thesekings."  When I used to read that in Sunday School, it suggested to methe several kings of such countries as England, France, Spain, Germany,Russia, etc., arrayed in splendid robes ablaze with jewels, marching ingrave procession, with sceptres of gold in their hands and flashingcrowns upon their heads.  But here in Ain Mellahah, after coming throughSyria, and after giving serious study to the character and customs of thecountry, the phrase "all these kings" loses its grandeur.  It suggestsonly a parcel of petty chiefs--ill-clad and ill-conditioned savages muchlike our Indians, who lived in full sight of each other and whose"kingdoms" were large when they were five miles square and contained twothousand souls.  The combined monarchies of the thirty "kings" destroyedby Joshua on one of his famous campaigns, only covered an area aboutequal to four of our counties of ordinary size.  The poor old sheik wesaw at Cesarea Philippi with his ragged band of a hundred followers,would have been called a "king" in those ancient times.
It is seven in the morning, and as we are in the country, the grass oughtto be sparkling with dew, the flowers enriching the air with theirfragrance, and the birds singing in the trees.  But alas, there is no dewhere, nor flowers, nor birds, nor trees.  There is a plain and anunshaded lake, and beyond them some barren mountains.  The tents aretumbling, the Arabs are quarreling like dogs and cats, as usual, thecampground is strewn with packages and bundles, the labor of packing themupon the backs of the mules is progressing with great activity, thehorses are saddled, the umbrellas are out, and in ten minutes we shallmount and the long procession will move again.  The white city of theMellahah, resurrected for a moment out of the dead centuries, will havedisappeared again and left no sign.
