To stab my youth with desperate knives, to wearThis paltry age's gaudy livery,To let each base hand filch my treasury,To mesh my soul within a woman's hair,And be mere Fortune's lackeyed groom,--I swearI love it not! these things are less to meThan the thin foam that frets upon the sea,Less than the thistledown of summer airWhich hath no seed: better to stand aloofFar from these slanderous fools who mock my lifeKnowing me not, better the lowliest roofFit for the meanest hind to sojourn in,Than to go back to that hoarse cave of strifeWhere my white soul first kissed the mouth of sin.
