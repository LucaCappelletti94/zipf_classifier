The Governor Speeds Joan
After a few days, Laxart took Joan to Vaucouleurs, and found lodging andguardianship for her with Catherine Royer, a wheelwright's wife, anhonest and good woman. Joan went to mass regularly, she helped do thehousework, earning her keep in that way, and if any wished to talk withher about her mission--and many did--she talked freely, making noconcealments regarding the matter now. I was soon housed near by, andwitnessed the effects which followed. At once the tidings spread that ayoung girl was come who was appointed of God to save France. The commonpeople flocked in crowds to look at her and speak with her, and her fairyoung loveliness won the half of their belief, and her deep earnestnessand transparent sincerity won the other half. The well-to-do remainedaway and scoffed, but that is their way.
Next, a prophecy of Merlin's, more than eight hundred years old, wascalled to mind, which said that in a far future time France would be lostby a woman and restored by a woman. France was now, for the first time,lost--and by a woman, Isabel of Bavaria, her base Queen; doubtless thisfair and pure young girl was commissioned of Heaven to complete theprophecy.
This gave the growing interest a new and powerful impulse; the excitementrose higher and higher, and hope and faith along with it; and so fromVaucouleurs wave after wave of this inspiring enthusiasm flowed out overthe land, far and wide, invading all the villages and refreshing andrevivifying the perishing children of France; and from these villagescame people who wanted to see for themselves, hear for themselves; andthey did see and hear, and believe. They filled the town; they more thanfilled it; inns and lodgings were packed, and yet half of the inflow hadto go without shelter. And still they came, winter as it was, for when aman's soul is starving, what does he care for meat and roof so he can butget that nobler hunger fed? Day after day, and still day after day thegreat tide rose. Domremy was dazed, amazed, stupefied, and said toitself, "Was this world-wonder in our familiar midst all these years andwe too dull to see it?" Jean and Pierre went out from the village, staredat and envied like the great and fortunate of the earth, and theirprogress to Vaucouleurs was like a triumph, all the country-side flockingto see and salute the brothers of one with whom angels had spoken face toface, and into whose hands by command of God they had delivered thedestinies of France.
The brothers brought the parents' blessing and godspeed to Joan, andtheir promise to bring it to her in person later; and so, with thisculminating happiness in her heart and the high hope it inspired, shewent and confronted the governor again. But he was no more tractable thanhe had been before. He refused to send her to the King. She wasdisappointed, but in no degree discouraged. She said:
"I must still come to you until I get the men-at-arms; for so it iscommanded, and I may not disobey. I must go to the Dauphin, though I goon my knees."
I and the two brothers were with Joan daily, to see the people that cameand hear what they said; and one day, sure enough, the Sieur Jean de Metzcame. He talked with her in a petting and playful way, as one talks withchildren, and said:
"What are you doing here, my little maid? Will they drive the King out ofFrance, and shall we all turn English?"
She answered him in her tranquil, serious way:
"I am come to bid Robert de Baudricourt take or send me to the King, buthe does not heed my words."
"Ah, you have an admirable persistence, truly; a whole year has notturned you from your wish. I saw you when you came before."
Joan said, as tranquilly as before:
"It is not a wish, it is a purpose. He will grant it. I can wait."
"Ah, perhaps it will not be wise to make too sure of that, my child.These governors are stubborn people to deal with. In case he shall notgrant your prayer--"
"He will grant it. He must. It is not a matter of choice."
The gentleman's playful mood began to disappear--one could see that, byhis face. Joan's earnestness was affecting him. It always happened thatpeople who began in jest with her ended by being in earnest. They soonbegan to perceive depths in her that they had not suspected; and then hermanifest sincerity and the rocklike steadfastness of her convictions wereforces which cowed levity, and it could not maintain its self-respect intheir presence. The Sieur de Metz was thoughtful for a moment or two,then he began, quite soberly:
"Is it necessary that you go to the King soon?--that is, I mean--"
"Before Mid-Lent, even though I wear away my legs to the knees!"
She said it with that sort of repressed fieriness that means so much whena person's heart is in a thing. You could see the response in thatnobleman's face; you could see his eye light up; there was sympathythere. He said, most earnestly:
"God knows I think you should have the men-at-arms, and that somewhatwould come of it. What is it that you would do? What is your hope andpurpose?"
"To rescue France. And it is appointed that I shall do it. For no oneelse in the world, neither kings, nor dukes, no any other, can recoverthe kingdom of France, and there is no help but in me."
The words had a pleading and pathetic sound, and they touched that goodnobleman. I saw it plainly. Joan dropped her voice a little, and said:"But indeed I would rather spin with my poor mother, for this is not mycalling; but I must go and do it, for it is my Lord's will."
"Who is your Lord?"
"He is God."
Then the Sieur de Metz, following the impressive old feudal fashion,knelt and laid his hands within Joan's in sign of fealty, and made oaththat by God's help he himself would take her to the king.
The next day came the Sieur Bertrand de Poulengy, and he also pledged hisoath and knightly honor to abide with her and follower witherosever shemight lead.
This day, too, toward evening, a great rumor went flying abroad throughthe town--namely, that the very governor himself was going to visit theyoung girl in her humble lodgings. So in the morning the streets andlanes were packed with people waiting to see if this strange thing wouldindeed happen. And happen it did. The governor rode in state, attended byhis guards, and the news of it went everywhere, and made a greatsensation, and modified the scoffings of the people of quality and raisedJoan's credit higher than ever.
The governor had made up his mind to one thing: Joan was either a witchor a saint, and he meant to find out which it was. So he brought a priestwith him to exorcise the devil that was in her in case there was onethere. The priest performed his office, but found no devil. He merelyhurt Joan's feelings and offended her piety without need, for he hadalready confessed her before this, and should have known, if he knewanything, that devils cannot abide the confessional, but utter cries ofanguish and the most profane and furious cursings whenever they areconfronted with that holy office.
The governor went away troubled and full of thought, and not knowing whatto do. And while he pondered and studied, several days went by and the14th of February was come. Then Joan went to the castle and said:
"In God's name, Robert de Baudricourt, you are too slow about sending me,and have caused damage thereby, for this day the Dauphin's cause has losta battle near Orleans, and will suffer yet greater injury if you do notsend me to him soon."
The governor was perplexed by this speech, and said:
"To-day, child, to-day? How can you know what has happened in that regionto-day? It would take eight or ten days for the word to come."
"My Voices have brought the word to me, and it is true. A battle was lostto-day, and you are in fault to delay me so."
The governor walked the floor awhile, talking within himself, but lettinga great oath fall outside now and then; and finally he said:
"Harkye! go in peace, and wait. If it shall turn out as you say, I willgive you the letter and send you to the King, and not otherwise."
Joan said with fervor:
"Now God be thanked, these waiting days are almost done. In nine days youwill fetch me the letter."
Already the people of Vaucouleurs had given her a horse and had armed andequipped her as a soldier. She got no chance to try the horse and see ifshe could ride it, for her great first duty was to abide at her post andlift up the hopes and spirits of all who would come to talk with her, andprepare them to help in the rescue and regeneration of the kingdom. Thisoccupied every waking moment she had. But it was no matter. There wasnothing she could not learn--and in the briefest time, too. Her horsewould find this out in the first hour. Meantime the brothers and I tookthe horse in turn and began to learn to ride. And we had teaching in theuse of the sword and other arms also.
On the 20th Joan called her small army together--the two knights and hertwo brothers and me--for a private council of war. No, it was not acouncil, that is not the right name, for she did not consult with us, shemerely gave us orders. She mapped out the course she would travel towardthe King, and did it like a person perfectly versed in geography; andthis itinerary of daily marches was so arranged as to avoid here andthere peculiarly dangerous regions by flank movements--which showed thatshe knew her political geography as intimately as she knew her physicalgeography; yet she had never had a day's schooling, of course, and waswithout education. I was astonished, but thought her Voices must havetaught her. But upon reflection I saw that this was not so. By herreferences to what this and that and the other person had told her, Iperceived that she had been diligently questioning those crowds ofvisiting strangers, and that out of them she had patiently dug all thismass of invaluable knowledge. The two knights were filled with wonder ather good sense and sagacity.
She commanded us to make preparations to travel by night and sleep by dayin concealment, as almost the whole of our long journey would be throughthe enemy's country.
Also, she commanded that we should keep the date of our departure asecret, since she meant to get away unobserved. Otherwise we should besent off with a grand demonstration which would advertise us to theenemy, and we should be ambushed and captured somewhere. Finally shesaid:
"Nothing remains, now, but that I confide to you the date of ourdeparture, so that you may make all needful preparation in time, leavingnothing to be done in haste and badly at the last moment. We march the23d, at eleven of the clock at night."
Then we were dismissed. The two knights were startled--yes, and troubled;and the Sieur Bertrand said:
"Even if the governor shall really furnish the letter and the escort, hestill may not do it in time to meet the date she has chosen. Then how canshe venture to name that date? It is a great risk--a great risk to selectand decide upon the date, in this state of uncertainty."
I said:
"Since she has named the 23d, we may trust her. The Voices have told her,I think. We shall do best to obey."
We did obey. Joan's parents were notified to come before the 23d, butprudence forbade that they be told why this limit was named.
All day, the 23d, she glanced up wistfully whenever new bodies ofstrangers entered the house, but her parents did not appear. Still shewas not discouraged, but hoped on. But when night fell at last, her hopesperished, and the tears came; however, she dashed them away, and said:
"It was to be so, no doubt; no doubt it was so ordered; I must bear it,and will."
De Metz tried to comfort her by saying:
"The governor sends no word; it may be that they will come to-morrow,and--"
He got no further, for she interrupted him, saying:
"To what good end? We start at eleven to-night."
And it was so. At ten the governor came, with his guard and arms, withhorses and equipment for me and for the brothers, and gave Joan a letterto the King. Then he took off his sword, and belted it about her waistwith his own hands, and said:
"You said true, child. The battle was lost, on the day you said. So Ihave kept my word. Now go--come of it what may."
Joan gave him thanks, and he went his way.
The lost battle was the famous disaster that is called in history theBattle of the Herrings.
All the lights in the house were at once put out, and a little whileafter, when the streets had become dark and still, we crept stealthilythrough them and out at the western gate and rode away under whip andspur.
