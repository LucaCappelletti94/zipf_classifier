When people do not respect us we are sharply offended; yet deep down inhis private heart no man much respects himself. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Necessarily, the human interest is the first interest in the log-book ofany country. The annals of Tasmania, in whose shadow we were sailing,are lurid with that feature. Tasmania was a convict-dump, in old times;this has been indicated in the account of the Conciliator, wherereference is made to vain attempts of desperate convicts to win topermanent freedom, after escaping from Macquarrie Harbor and the "Gatesof Hell." In the early days Tasmania had a great population of convicts,of both sexes and all ages, and a bitter hard life they had. In one spotthere was a settlement of juvenile convicts--children--who had been sentthither from their home and their friends on the other side of the globeto expiate their "crimes."
In due course our ship entered the estuary called the Derwent, at whosehead stands Hobart, the capital of Tasmania. The Derwent's shoresfurnish scenery of an interesting sort. The historian Laurie, whosebook, "The Story of Australasia," is just out, invoices its features withconsiderable truth and intemperance: "The marvelous picturesqueness ofevery point of view, combined with the clear balmy atmosphere and thetransparency of the ocean depths, must have delighted and deeplyimpressed" the early explorers. "If the rock-bound coasts, sullen,defiant, and lowering, seemed uninviting, these were occasionally brokeninto charmingly alluring coves floored with golden sand, clad withevergreen shrubbery, and adorned with every variety of indigenous wattle,she-oak, wild flower, and fern, from the delicately graceful'maiden-hair' to the palm-like 'old man'; while the majestic gum-tree,clean and smooth as the mast of 'some tall admiral' pierces the clear airto the height of 230 feet or more."
It looked so to me. "Coasting along Tasman's Peninsula, what a shock ofpleasant wonder must have struck the early mariner on suddenly sightingCape Pillar, with its cluster of black-ribbed basaltic columns rising toa height of 900 feet, the hydra head wreathed in a turban of fleecycloud, the base lashed by jealous waves spouting angry fountains offoam."
That is well enough, but I did not suppose those snags were 900 feethigh. Still they were a very fine show. They stood boldly out bythemselves, and made a fascinatingly odd spectacle. But there wasnothing about their appearance to suggest the heads of a hydra. Theylooked like a row of lofty slabs with their upper ends tapered to theshape of a carving-knife point; in fact, the early voyager, ignorant oftheir great height, might have mistaken them for a rusty old rank ofpiles that had sagged this way and that out of the perpendicular.
The Peninsula is lofty, rocky, and densely clothed with scrub, or brush,or both. It is joined to the main by a low neck. At this junction wasformerly a convict station called Port Arthur--a place hard to escapefrom. Behind it was the wilderness of scrub, in which a fugitive wouldsoon starve; in front was the narrow neck, with a cordon of chained dogsacross it, and a line of lanterns, and a fence of living guards, armed.We saw the place as we swept by--that is, we had a glimpse of what wewere told was the entrance to Port Arthur. The glimpse was worthsomething, as a remembrancer, but that was all.
The voyage thence up the Derwent Frith displays a grand succession offairy visions, in its entire length elsewhere unequaled. In gliding overthe deep blue sea studded with lovely islets luxuriant to the water'sedge, one is at a loss which scene to choose for contemplation and toadmire most. When the Huon and Bruni have been passed, there seems nopossible chance of a rival; but suddenly Mount Wellington, massive andnoble like his brother Etna, literally heaves in sight, sternly guardedon either hand by Mounts Nelson and Rumney; presently we arrive atSullivan's Cove--Hobart!
It is an attractive town. It sits on low hills that slope to the harbor--a harbor that looks like a river, and is as smooth as one. Its stillsurface is pictured with dainty reflections of boats and grassy banks andluxuriant foliage. Back of the town rise highlands that are clothed inwoodland loveliness, and over the way is that noble mountain, Wellington,a stately bulk, a most majestic pile. How beautiful is the whole region,for form, and grouping, and opulence, and freshness of foliage, andvariety of color, and grace and shapeliness of the hills, the capes, the,promontories; and then, the splendor of the sunlight, the dim richdistances, the charm of the water-glimpses! And it was in this paradisethat the yellow-liveried convicts were landed, and the Corps-banditsquartered, and the wanton slaughter of the kangaroo-chasing blackinnocents consummated on that autumn day in May, in the brutish old time.It was all out of keeping with the place, a sort of bringing of heavenand hell together.
The remembrance of this paradise reminds me that it was at Hobart that westruck the head of the procession of Junior Englands. We were toencounter other sections of it in New Zealand, presently, and otherslater in Natal. Wherever the exiled Englishman can find in his new homeresemblances to his old one, he is touched to the marrow of his being;the love that is in his heart inspires his imagination, and these alliedforces transfigure those resemblances into authentic duplicates of therevered originals. It is beautiful, the feeling which works thisenchantment, and it compels one's homage; compels it, and also compelsone's assent--compels it always--even when, as happens sometimes, onedoes not see the resemblances as clearly as does the exile who ispointing them out.
The resemblances do exist, it is quite true; and often they cunninglyapproximate the originals--but after all, in the matter of certainphysical patent rights there is only one England. Now that I havesampled the globe, I am not in doubt. There is a beauty of Switzerland,and it is repeated in the glaciers and snowy ranges of many parts of theearth; there is a beauty of the fiord, and it is repeated in New Zealandand Alaska; there is a beauty of Hawaii, and it is repeated in tenthousand islands of the Southern seas; there is a beauty of the prairieand the plain, and it is repeated here and there in the earth; each ofthese is worshipful, each is perfect in its way, yet holds no monopoly ofits beauty; but that beauty which is England is alone--it has noduplicate.
It is made up of very simple details--just grass, and trees, and shrubs,and roads, and hedges, and gardens, and houses, and vines, and churches,and castles, and here and there a ruin--and over it all a mellowdream-haze of history. But its beauty is incomparable, and all its own.
Hobart has a peculiarity--it is the neatest town that the sun shines on;and I incline to believe that it is also the cleanest. However that maybe, its supremacy in neatness is not to be questioned. There cannot beanother town in the world that has no shabby exteriors; no rickety gatesand fences, no neglected houses crumbling to ruin, no crazy and unsightlysheds, no weed-grown front-yards of the poor, no back-yards littered withtin cans and old boots and empty bottles, no rubbish in the gutters, noclutter on the sidewalks, no outer-borders fraying out into dirty lanesand tin-patched huts. No, in Hobart all the aspects are tidy, and all acomfort to the eye; the modestest cottage looks combed and brushed, andhas its vines, its flowers, its neat fence, its neat gate, its comely catasleep on the window ledge.
We had a glimpse of the museum, by courtesy of the American gentleman whois curator of it. It has samples of half-a-dozen different kinds ofmarsupials--[A marsupial is a plantigrade vertebrate whose specialty isits pocket. In some countries it is extinct, in the others it is rare.The first American marsupials were Stephen Girard, Mr. Aston and theopossum; the principal marsupials of the Southern Hemisphere are Mr.Rhodes, and the kangaroo. I, myself, am the latest marsupial. Also, Imight boast that I have the largest pocket of them all. But there isnothing in that.]--one, the "Tasmanian devil;" that is, I think he wasone of them. And there was a fish with lungs. When the water dries upit can live in the mud. Most curious of all was a parrot that killssheep. On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand sheep in awhole year. He doesn't want the whole sheep, but only the kidney-fat.This restricted taste makes him an expensive bird to support. To get thefat he drives his beak in and rips it out; the wound is mortal. Thisparrot furnishes a notable example of evolution brought about by changedconditions. When the sheep culture was introduced, it presently broughtfamine to the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub which had alwaysthitherto been the parrot's diet. The miseries of hunger made the birdwilling to eat raw flesh, since it could get no other food, and it beganto pick remnants of meat from sheep skins hung out on the fences to dry.It soon came to prefer sheep meat to any other food, and by and by itcame to prefer the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep. Theparrot's bill was not well shaped for digging out the fat, but Naturefixed that matter; she altered the bill's shape, and now the parrot candig out kidney-fat better than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, oranybody else, for that matter--even an Admiral.
And there was another curiosity--quite a stunning one, I thought:Arrow-heads and knives just like those which Primeval Man made out offlint, and thought he had done such a wonderful thing--yes, and has beenhumored and coddled in that superstition by this age of admiringscientists until there is probably no living with him in the other worldby now. Yet here is his finest and nicest work exactly duplicated in ourday; and by people who have never heard of him or his works: byaborigines who lived in the islands of these seas, within our time. Andthey not only duplicated those works of art but did it in the brittlestand most treacherous of substances--glass: made them out of old brandybottles flung out of the British camps; millions of tons of them. It istime for Primeval Man to make a little less noise, now. He has had hisday. He is not what he used to be. We had a drive through a bloomy andodorous fairy-land, to the Refuge for the Indigent--a spacious andcomfortable home, with hospitals, etc., for both sexes. There was acrowd in there, of the oldest people I have ever seen. It was like beingsuddenly set down in a new world--a weird world where Youth has neverbeen, a world sacred to Age, and bowed forms, and wrinkles. Out of the359 persons present, 223, were ex-convicts, and could have told stirringtales, no doubt, if they had been minded to talk; 42 of the 359 were past80, and several were close upon 90; the average age at death there is 76years. As for me, I have no use for that place; it is too healthy.Seventy is old enough--after that, there is too much risk. Youth andgaiety might vanish, any day--and then, what is left? Death in life;death without its privileges, death without its benefits. There were 185women in that Refuge, and 81 of them were ex-convicts.
The steamer disappointed us. Instead of making a long visit at Hobart,as usual, she made a short one. So we got but a glimpse of Tasmania, andthen moved on.
