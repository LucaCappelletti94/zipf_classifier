When your watch gets out of order you have choice of two things to do:throw it in the fire or take it to the watch-tinker. The former is thequickest. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The Arundel Castle is the finest boat I have seen in these seas. She isthoroughly modern, and that statement covers a great deal of ground. Shehas the usual defect, the common defect, the universal defect, the defectthat has never been missing from any ship that ever sailed--she hasimperfect beds. Many ships have good beds, but no ship has very goodones. In the matter of beds all ships have been badly edited, ignorantlyedited, from the beginning. The selection of the beds is given to somehearty, strong-backed, self-made man, when it ought to be given to afrail woman accustomed from girlhood to backaches and insomnia. Nothingis so rare, on either side of the ocean, as a perfect bed; nothing is sodifficult to make. Some of the hotels on both sides provide it, but noship ever does or ever did. In Noah's Ark the beds were simplyscandalous. Noah set the fashion, and it will endure in one degree ofmodification or another till the next flood.
8 A.M. Passing Isle de Bourbon. Broken-up sky-line of volcanicmountains in the middle. Surely it would not cost much to repair them,and it seems inexcusable neglect to leave them as they are.
It seems stupid to send tired men to Europe to rest. It is no properrest for the mind to clatter from town to town in the dust and cinders,and examine galleries and architecture, and be always meeting people andlunching and teaing and dining, and receiving worrying cables andletters. And a sea voyage on the Atlantic is of no use--voyage tooshort, sea too rough. The peaceful Indian and Pacific Oceans and thelong stretches of time are the healing thing.
May 2, AM. A fair, great ship in sight, almost the first we have seen inthese weeks of lonely voyaging. We are now in the Mozambique Channel,between Madagascar and South Africa, sailing straight west for DelagoaBay.
Last night, the burly chief engineer, middle-aged, was standing telling aspirited seafaring tale, and had reached the most exciting place, where aman overboard was washing swiftly astern on the great seas, and upliftingdespairing cries, everybody racing aft in a frenzy of excitement andfading hope, when the band, which had been silent a moment, beganimpressively its closing piece, the English national anthem. As simplyas if he was unconscious of what he was doing, he stopped his story,uncovered, laid his laced cap against his breast, and slightly bent hisgrizzled head. The few bars finished, he put on his cap and took up histale again, as naturally as if that interjection of music had been a partof it. There was something touching and fine about it, and it was movingto reflect that he was one of a myriad, scattered over every part of theglobe, who by turn was doing as he was doing every hour of thetwenty-four--those awake doing it while the others slept--thoseimpressive bars forever floating up out of the various climes, neversilent and never lacking reverent listeners.
All that I remember about Madagascar is that Thackeray's little Billiewent up to the top of the mast and there knelt him upon his knee, saying,"I see
 "Jerusalem and Madagascar, And North and South Amerikee."
May 3. Sunday. Fifteen or twenty Africanders who will end their voyageto-day and strike for their several homes from Delagoa Bay to-morrow, satup singing on the afterdeck in the moonlight till 3 A.M. Good fun andwholesome. And the songs were clean songs, and some of them werehallowed by tender associations. Finally, in a pause, a man asked, "Haveyou heard about the fellow that kept a diary crossing the Atlantic?"It was a discord, a wet blanket. The men were not in the mood forhumorous dirt. The songs had carried them to their homes, and in spiritthey sat by those far hearthstones, and saw faces and heard voices otherthan those that were about them. And so this disposition to drag in anold indecent anecdote got no welcome; nobody answered. The poor manhadn't wit enough to see that he had blundered, but asked his questionagain. Again there was no response. It was embarrassing for him. Inhis confusion he chose the wrong course, did the wrong thing--began theanecdote. Began it in a deep and hostile stillness, where had been suchlife and stir and warm comradeship before. He delivered himself of thebrief details of the diary's first day, and did it with some confidenceand a fair degree of eagerness. It fell flat. There was an awkwardpause. The two rows of men sat like statues. There was no movement, nosound. He had to go on; there was no other way, at least none that ananimal of his calibre could think of. At the close of each day's diary,the same dismal silence followed. When at last he finished his tale andsprung the indelicate surprise which is wont to fetch a crash oflaughter, not a ripple of sound resulted. It was as if the tale had beentold to dead men. After what seemed a long, long time, somebody sighed,somebody else stirred in his seat; presently, the men dropped into a lowmurmur of confidential talk, each with his neighbor, and the incident wasclosed. There were indications that that man was fond of his anecdote;that it was his pet, his standby, his shot that never missed, hisreputation-maker. But he will never tell it again. No doubt he willthink of it sometimes, for that cannot well be helped; and then he willsee a picture, and always the same picture--the double rank of dead men;the vacant deck stretching away in dimming perspective beyond them, thewide desert of smooth sea all abroad; the rim of the moon spying frombehind a rag of black cloud; the remote top of the mizzenmast shearing azigzag path through the fields of stars in the deeps of space; and thissoft picture will remind him of the time that he sat in the midst of itand told his poor little tale and felt so lonesome when he got through.
Fifty Indians and Chinamen asleep in a big tent in the waist of the shipforward; they lie side by side with no space between; the former wrappedup, head and all, as in the Indian streets, the Chinamen uncovered; thelamp and things for opium smoking in the center.
A passenger said it was ten 2-ton truck loads of dynamite that latelyexploded at Johannesburg. Hundreds killed; he doesn't know how many;limbs picked up for miles around. Glass shattered, and roofs swept awayor collapsed 200 yards off; fragment of iron flung three and a halfmiles.
It occurred at 3 p.m.; at 6, L65,000 had been subscribed. When thispassenger left, L35,000 had been voted by city and state governments andL100,000 by citizens and business corporations. When news of thedisaster was telephoned to the Exchange L35,000 were subscribed in thefirst five minutes. Subscribing was still going on when he left; thepapers had ceased the names, only the amounts--too many names; not enoughroom. L100,000 subscribed by companies and citizens; if this is true, itmust be what they call in Australia "a record"--the biggest instance of aspontaneous outpour for charity in history, considering the size of thepopulation it was drawn from, $8 or $10 for each white resident, babiesat the breast included.
Monday, May 4. Steaming slowly in the stupendous Delagoa Bay, its dimarms stretching far away and disappearing on both sides. It couldfurnish plenty of room for all the ships in the world, but it is shoal.The lead has given us 3 1/2 fathoms several times and we are drawingthat, lacking 6 inches.
A bold headland--precipitous wall, 150 feet high, very strong, red color,stretching a mile or so. A man said it was Portuguese blood--battlefought here with the natives last year. I think this doubtful. Prettycluster of houses on the tableland above the red-and rolling stretches ofgrass and groups of trees, like England.
The Portuguese have the railroad (one passenger train a day) to theborder--70 miles--then the Netherlands Company have it. Thousands oftons of freight on the shore--no cover. This is Portuguese allover--indolence, piousness, poverty, impotence.
Crews of small boats and tugs, all jet black woolly heads and verymuscular.
Winter. The South African winter is just beginning now, but nobody butan expert can tell it from summer. However, I am tired of summer; wehave had it unbroken for eleven months. We spent the afternoon on shore,Delagoa Bay. A small town--no sights. No carriages. Three 'rickshas,but we couldn't get them--apparently private. These Portuguese are arich brown, like some of the Indians. Some of the blacks have the longhorse beads and very long chins of the negroes of the picture books; butmost of them are exactly like the negroes of our Southern States roundfaces, flat noses, good-natured, and easy laughers.
Flocks of black women passed along, carrying outrageously heavy bags offreight on their heads. The quiver of their leg as the foot was plantedand the strain exhibited by their bodies showed what a tax upon theirstrength the load was. They were stevedores and doing full stevedoreswork. They were very erect when unladden--from carrying heavy loads ontheir heads--just like the Indian women. It gives them a proud finecarriage.
Sometimes one saw a woman carrying on her head a laden and top-heavybasket the shape of an inverted pyramid-its top the size of a soup-plate,its base the diameter of a teacup. It required nice balancing--and gotit.
No bright colors; yet there were a good many Hindoos.
The Second Class Passenger came over as usual at "lights out" (11) and welounged along the spacious vague solitudes of the deck and smoked thepeaceful pipe and talked. He told me an incident in Mr. Barnum's lifewhich was evidently characteristic of that great showman in several ways:
This was Barnum's purchase of Shakespeare's birthplace, a quarter of acentury ago. The Second Class Passenger was in Jamrach's employ at thetime and knew Barnum well. He said the thing began in this way. Onemorning Barnum and Jamrach were in Jamrach's little private snuggery backof the wilderness of caged monkeys and snakes and other commonplaces ofJamrach's stock in trade, refreshing themselves after an arduous strokeof business, Jamrach with something orthodox, Barnum with somethingheterodox--for Barnum was a teetotaler. The stroke of business was inthe elephant line. Jamrach had contracted to deliver to Barnum in NewYork 18 elephants for $360,000 in time for the next season's opening.Then it occurred to Mr. Barnum that he needed a "card" He suggestedJumbo. Jamrach said he would have to think of something else--Jumbocouldn't be had; the Zoo wouldn't part with that elephant. Barnum saidhe was willing to pay a fortune for Jumbo if he could get him. Jamrachsaid it was no use to think about it; that Jumbo was as popular as thePrince of Wales and the Zoo wouldn't dare to sell him; all England wouldbe outraged at the idea; Jumbo was an English institution; he was part ofthe national glory; one might as well think of buying the Nelsonmonument. Barnum spoke up with vivacity and said:
"It's a first-rate idea. I'll buy the Monument."
Jamrach was speechless for a second. Then he said, like one ashamed"You caught me. I was napping. For a moment I thought you were inearnest."
Barnum said pleasantly--
"I was in earnest. I know they won't sell it, but no matter, I will notthrow away a good idea for all that. All I want is a big advertisement.I will keep the thing in mind, and if nothing better turns up I willoffer to buy it. That will answer every purpose. It will furnish me acouple of columns of gratis advertising in every English and Americanpaper for a couple of months, and give my show the biggest boom a showever had in this world."
Jamrach started to deliver a burst of admiration, but was interrupted byBarnum, who said:
"Here is a state of things! England ought to blush."
His eye had fallen upon something in the newspaper. He read it throughto himself, then read it aloud. It said that the house that Shakespearewas born in at Stratford-on-Avon was falling gradually to ruin throughneglect; that the room where the poet first saw the light was now servingas a butcher's shop; that all appeals to England to contribute money (therequisite sum stated) to buy and repair the house and place it in thecare of salaried and trustworthy keepers had fallen resultless. ThenBarnum said:
"There's my chance. Let Jumbo and the Monument alone for the present--they'll keep. I'll buy Shakespeare's house. I'll set it up in myMuseum in New York and put a glass case around it and make a sacred thingof it; and you'll see all America flock there to worship; yes, andpilgrims from the whole earth; and I'll make them take their hats off,too. In America we know how to value anything that Shakespeare's touchhas made holy. You'll see."
In conclusion the S. C. P. said:
"That is the way the thing came about. Barnum did buy Shakespeare'shouse. He paid the price asked, and received the properly attesteddocuments of sale. Then there was an explosion, I can tell you. Englandrose! That, the birthplace of the master-genius of all the ages and allthe climes--that priceless possession of Britain--to be carted out of thecountry like so much old lumber and set up for sixpenny desecration in aYankee show-shop--the idea was not to be tolerated for a moment. Englandrose in her indignation; and Barnum was glad to relinquish his prize andoffer apologies. However, he stood out for a compromise; he claimed aconcession--England must let him have Jumbo. And England consented, butnot cheerfully."
It shows how, by help of time, a story can grow--even after Barnum hashad the first innings in the telling of it. Mr. Barnum told me the storyhimself, years ago. He said that the permission to buy Jumbo was not aconcession; the purchase was made and the animal delivered before thepublic knew anything about it. Also, that the securing of Jumbo was allthe advertisement he needed. It produced many columns of newspaper talk,free of cost, and he was satisfied. He said that if he had failed to getJumbo he would have caused his notion of buying the Nelson Monument to betreacherously smuggled into print by some trusty friend, and after he hadgotten a few hundred pages of gratuitous advertising out of it, he wouldhave come out with a blundering, obtuse, but warm-hearted letter ofapology, and in a postscript to it would have naively proposed to let theMonument go, and take Stonehenge in place of it at the same price.
It was his opinion that such a letter, written with well-simulatedasinine innocence and gush would have gotten his ignorance and stupidityan amount of newspaper abuse worth six fortunes to him, and notpurchasable for twice the money.
I knew Mr. Barnum well, and I placed every confidence in the accountwhich he gave me of the Shakespeare birthplace episode. He said he foundthe house neglected and going-to decay, and he inquired into the matterand was told that many times earnest efforts had been made to raise moneyfor its proper repair and preservation, but without success. He thenproposed to buy it. The proposition was entertained, and a price named--$50,000, I think; but whatever it was, Barnum paid the money down,without remark, and the papers were drawn up and executed. He said thatit had been his purpose to set up the house in his Museum, keep it inrepair, protect it from name-scribblers and other desecrators, and leaveit by bequest to the safe and perpetual guardianship of the SmithsonianInstitute at Washington.
But as soon as it was found that Shakespeare's house had passed intoforeign hands and was going to be carried across the ocean, England wasstirred as no appeal from the custodians of the relic had ever stirredEngland before, and protests came flowing in--and money, too, to stop theoutrage. Offers of repurchase were made--offers of double the money thatMr. Barnum had paid for the house. He handed the house back, but tookonly the sum which it had cost him--but on the condition that anendowment sufficient for the future safeguarding and maintenance of thesacred relic should be raised. This condition was fulfilled.
That was Barnum's account of the episode; and to the end of his days heclaimed with pride and satisfaction that not England, but America--represented by him--saved the birthplace of Shakespeare from destruction.
At 3 P.M., May 6th, the ship slowed down, off the land, and thoughtfullyand cautiously picked her way into the snug harbor of Durban, SouthAfrica.
