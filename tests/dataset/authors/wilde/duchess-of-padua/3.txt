SCENE
A large corridor in the Ducal Palace: a window (L.C.) looks out ona view of Padua by moonlight: a staircase (R.C.) leads up to adoor with a portiere of crimson velvet, with the Duke's armsembroidered in gold on it: on the lowest step of the staircase afigure draped in black is sitting: the hall is lit by an ironcresset filled with burning tow: thunder and lightning outside:the time is night.
[Enter GUIDO through the window.]
GUIDO
The wind is rising: how my ladder shook!I thought that every gust would break the cords![Looks out at the city.]Christ! What a night:Great thunder in the heavens, and wild lightningsStriking from pinnacle to pinnacleAcross the city, till the dim houses seemTo shudder and to shake as each new glareDashes adown the street.[Passes across the stage to foot of staircase.]Ah! who art thouThat sittest on the stair, like unto DeathWaiting a guilty soul? [A pause.]Canst thou not speak?Or has this storm laid palsy on thy tongue,And chilled thy utterance?[The figure rises and takes off his mask.]
MORANZONE
Guido Ferranti,Thy murdered father laughs for joy to-night.
GUIDO
[confusedly]What, art thou here?
MORANZONE
Ay, waiting for your coming.
GUIDO
[looking away from him]I did not think to see you, but am glad,That you may know the thing I mean to do.
MORANZONE
First, I would have you know my well-laid plans;Listen: I have set horses at the gateWhich leads to Parma: when you have done your businessWe will ride hence, and by to-morrow night -
GUIDO
It cannot be.
MORANZONE
Nay, but it shall.
GUIDO
Listen, Lord Moranzone,I am resolved not to kill this man.
MORANZONE
Surely my ears are traitors, speak again:It cannot be but age has dulled my powers,I am an old man now: what did you say?You said that with that dagger in your beltYou would avenge your father's bloody murder;Did you not say that?
GUIDO
No, my lord, I saidI was resolved not to kill the Duke.
MORANZONE
You said not that; it is my senses mock me;Or else this midnight air o'ercharged with stormAlters your message in the giving it.
GUIDO
Nay, you heard rightly; I'll not kill this man.
MORANZONE
What of thine oath, thou traitor, what of thine oath?
GUIDO
I am resolved not to keep that oath.
MORANZONE
What of thy murdered father?
GUIDO
Dost thou thinkMy father would be glad to see me coming,This old man's blood still hot upon mine hands?
MORANZONE
Ay! he would laugh for joy.
GUIDO
I do not think so,There is better knowledge in the other world;Vengeance is God's, let God himself revenge.
MORANZONE
Thou art God's minister of vengeance.
GUIDO
No!God hath no minister but his own hand.I will not kill this man.
MORANZONE
Why are you here,If not to kill him, then?
GUIDO
Lord Moranzone,I purpose to ascend to the Duke's chamber,And as he lies asleep lay on his breastThe dagger and this writing; when he awakesThen he will know who held him in his powerAnd slew him not: this is the noblest vengeanceWhich I can take.
MORANZONE
You will not slay him?
GUIDO
No.
MORANZONE
Ignoble son of a noble father,Who sufferest this man who sold that fatherTo live an hour.
GUIDO
'Twas thou that hindered me;I would have killed him in the open square,The day I saw him first.
MORANZONE
It was not yet time;Now it is time, and, like some green-faced girl,Thou pratest of forgiveness.
GUIDO
No! revenge:The right revenge my father's son should take.
MORANZONE
You are a coward,Take out the knife, get to the Duke's chamber,And bring me back his heart upon the blade.When he is dead, then you can talk to meOf noble vengeances.
GUIDO
Upon thine honour,And by the love thou bearest my father's name,Dost thou think my father, that great gentleman,That generous soldier, that most chivalrous lord,Would have crept at night-time, like a common thief,And stabbed an old man sleeping in his bed,However he had wronged him: tell me that.
MORANZONE
[after some hesitation]You have sworn an oath, see that you keep that oath.Boy, do you think I do not know your secret,Your traffic with the Duchess?
GUIDO
Silence, liar!The very moon in heaven is not more chaste.Nor the white stars so pure.
MORANZONE
And yet, you love her;Weak fool, to let love in upon your life,Save as a plaything.
GUIDO
You do well to talk:Within your veins, old man, the pulse of youthThrobs with no ardour. Your eyes full of rheumHave against Beauty closed their filmy doors,And your clogged ears, losing their natural sense,Have shut you from the music of the world.You talk of love! You know not what it is.
MORANZONE
Oh, in my time, boy, have I walked i' the moon,Swore I would live on kisses and on blisses,Swore I would die for love, and did not die,Wrote love bad verses; ay, and sung them badly,Like all true lovers: Oh, I have done the tricks!I know the partings and the chamberings;We are all animals at best, and loveIs merely passion with a holy name.
GUIDO
Now then I know you have not loved at all.Love is the sacrament of life; it setsVirtue where virtue was not; cleanses menOf all the vile pollutions of this world;It is the fire which purges gold from dross,It is the fan which winnows wheat from chaff,It is the spring which in some wintry soilMakes innocence to blossom like a rose.The days are over when God walked with men,But Love, which is his image, holds his place.When a man loves a woman, then he knowsGod's secret, and the secret of the world.There is no house so lowly or so mean,Which, if their hearts be pure who live in it,Love will not enter; but if bloody murderKnock at the Palace gate and is let in,Love like a wounded thing creeps out and dies.This is the punishment God sets on sin.The wicked cannot love.[A groan comes from the DUKE's chamber.]Ah! What is that?Do you not hear? 'Twas nothing.So I thinkThat it is woman's mission by their loveTo save the souls of men: and loving her,My Lady, my white Beatrice, I beginTo see a nobler and a holier vengeanceIn letting this man live, than doth resideIn bloody deeds o' night, stabs in the dark,And young hands clutching at a palsied throat.It was, I think, for love's sake that Lord Christ,Who was indeed himself incarnate Love,Bade every man forgive his enemy.
MORANZONE
[sneeringly]That was in Palestine, not Padua;And said for saints: I have to do with men.
GUIDO
It was for all time said.
MORANZONE
And your white Duchess,What will she do to thank you?
GUIDO
Alas, I will not see her face again.'Tis but twelve hours since I parted from her,So suddenly, and with such violent passion,That she has shut her heart against me now:No, I will never see her.
MORANZONE
What will you do?
GUIDO
After that I have laid the dagger there,Get hence to-night from Padua.
MORANZONE
And then?
GUIDO
I will take service with the Doge at Venice,And bid him pack me straightway to the wars,And there I will, being now sick of life,Throw that poor life against some desperate spear.[A groan from the DUKE'S chamber again.]Did you not hear a voice?
MORANZONE
I always hear,From the dim confines of some sepulchre,A voice that cries for vengeance. We waste time,It will be morning soon; are you resolvedYou will not kill the Duke?
GUIDO
I am resolved.
MORANZONE
O wretched father, lying unavenged.
GUIDO
More wretched, were thy son a murderer.
MORANZONE
Why, what is life?
GUIDO
I do not know, my lord,I did not give it, and I dare not take it.
MORANZONE
I do not thank God often; but I thinkI thank him now that I have got no son!And you, what bastard blood flows in your veinsThat when you have your enemy in your graspYou let him go! I would that I had left youWith the dull hinds that reared you.
GUIDO
Better perhapsThat you had done so! May be better stillI'd not been born to this distressful world.
MORANZONE
Farewell!
GUIDO
Farewell! Some day, Lord Moranzone,You will understand my vengeance.
MORANZONE
Never, boy.[Gets out of window and exit by rope ladder.]
GUIDO
Father, I think thou knowest my resolve,And with this nobler vengeance art content.Father, I think in letting this man liveThat I am doing what thou wouldst have done.Father, I know not if a human voiceCan pierce the iron gateway of the dead,Or if the dead are set in ignoranceOf what we do, or do not, for their sakes.And yet I feel a presence in the air,There is a shadow standing at my side,And ghostly kisses seem to touch my lips,And leave them holier. [Kneels down.]O father, if 'tis thou,Canst thou not burst through the decrees of death,And if corporeal semblance show thyself,That I may touch thy hand!No, there is nothing. [Rises.]'Tis the night that cheats us with its phantoms,And, like a puppet-master, makes us thinkThat things are real which are not. It grows late.Now must I to my business.[Pulls out a letter from his doublet and reads it.]When he wakes,And sees this letter, and the dagger with it,Will he not have some loathing for his life,Repent, perchance, and lead a better life,Or will he mock because a young man sparedHis natural enemy? I do not care.Father, it is thy bidding that I do,Thy bidding, and the bidding of my loveWhich teaches me to know thee as thou art.[Ascends staircase stealthily, and just as he reaches out his handto draw back the curtain the Duchess appears all in white. GUIDOstarts back.]
DUCHESS
Guido! what do you here so late?
GUIDO
O white and spotless angel of my life,Sure thou hast come from Heaven with a messageThat mercy is more noble than revenge?
DUCHESS
There is no barrier between us now.
GUIDO
None, love, nor shall be.
DUCHESS
I have seen to that.
GUIDO
Tarry here for me.
DUCHESS
No, you are not going?You will not leave me as you did before?
GUIDO
I will return within a moment's space,But first I must repair to the Duke's chamber,And leave this letter and this dagger there,That when he wakes -
DUCHESS
When who wakes?
GUIDO
Why, the Duke.
DUCHESS
He will not wake again.
GUIDO
What, is he dead?
DUCHESS
Ay! he is dead.
GUIDO
O God! how wonderfulAre all thy secret ways! Who would have saidThat on this very night, when I had yieldedInto thy hands the vengeance that is thine,Thou with thy finger wouldst have touched the man,And bade him come before thy judgment seat.
DUCHESS
I have just killed him.
GUIDO
[in horror] Oh!
DUCHESS
He was asleep;Come closer, love, and I will tell you all.I had resolved to kill myself to-night.About an hour ago I waked from sleep,And took my dagger from beneath my pillow,Where I had hidden it to serve my need,And drew it from the sheath, and felt the edge,And thought of you, and how I loved you, Guido,And turned to fall upon it, when I markedThe old man sleeping, full of years and sin;There lay he muttering curses in his sleep,And as I looked upon his evil faceSuddenly like a flame there flashed across me,There is the barrier which Guido spoke of:You said there lay a barrier between us,What barrier but he? -I hardly knowWhat happened, but a steaming mist of bloodRose up between us two.
GUIDO
Oh, horrible!
DUCHESS
And then he groaned,And then he groaned no more! I only heardThe dripping of the blood upon the floor.
GUIDO
Enough, enough.
DUCHESS
Will you not kiss me now?Do you remember saying that women's loveTurns men to angels? well, the love of manTurns women into martyrs; for its sakeWe do or suffer anything.
GUIDO
O God!
DUCHESS
Will you not speak?
GUIDO
I cannot speak at all.
DUCHESS
Let as not talk of this! Let us go hence:Is not the barrier broken down between us?What would you more? Come, it is almost morning.[Puts her hand on GUIDO'S.]
GUIDO
[breaking from her]O damned saint! O angel fresh from Hell!What bloody devil tempted thee to this!That thou hast killed thy husband, that is nothing -Hell was already gaping for his soul -But thou hast murdered Love, and in its placeHast set a horrible and bloodstained thing,Whose very breath breeds pestilence and plague,And strangles Love.
DUCHESS
[in amazed wonder]I did it all for you.I would not have you do it, had you willed it,For I would keep you without blot or stain,A thing unblemished, unassailed, untarnished.Men do not know what women do for love.Have I not wrecked my soul for your dear sake,Here and hereafter?
GUIDO
No, do not touch me,Between us lies a thin red stream of blood;I dare not look across it: when you stabbed himYou stabbed Love with a sharp knife to the heart.We cannot meet again.
DUCHESS
[wringing her hands]For you! For you!I did it all for you: have you forgotten?You said there was a barrier between us;That barrier lies now i' the upper chamberUpset, overthrown, beaten, and battered down,And will not part us ever.
GUIDO
No, you mistook:Sin was the barrier, you have raised it up;Crime was the barrier, you have set it there.The barrier was murder, and your handHas builded it so high it shuts out heaven,It shuts out God.
DUCHESS
I did it all for you;You dare not leave me now: nay, Guido, listen.Get horses ready, we will fly to-night.The past is a bad dream, we will forget it:Before us lies the future: shall we not haveSweet days of love beneath our vines and laugh? -No, no, we will not laugh, but, when we weep,Well, we will weep together; I will serve you;I will be very meek and very gentle:You do not know me.
GUIDO
Nay, I know you now;Get hence, I say, out of my sight.
DUCHESS
[pacing up and down]O God,How I have loved this man!
GUIDO
You never loved me.Had it been so, Love would have stayed your hand.How could we sit together at Love's table?You have poured poison in the sacred wine,And Murder dips his fingers in the sop.
DUCHESS
[throws herself on her knees]Then slay me now! I have spilt blood to-night,You shall spill more, so we go hand in handTo heaven or to hell. Draw your sword, Guido.Quick, let your soul go chambering in my heart,It will but find its master's image there.Nay, if you will not slay me with your sword,Bid me to fall upon this reeking knife,And I will do it.
GUIDO
[wresting knife from her]Give it to me, I say.O God, your very hands are wet with blood!This place is Hell, I cannot tarry here.I pray you let me see your face no more.
DUCHESS
Better for me I had not seen your face.[GUIDO recoils: she seizes his hands as she kneels.]Nay, Guido, listen for a while:Until you came to Padua I livedWretched indeed, but with no murderous thought,Very submissive to a cruel Lord,Very obedient to unjust commands,
As pure I think as any gentle girlWho now would turn in horror from my hands -[Stands up.]You came: ah! Guido, the first kindly wordsI ever heard since I had come from FranceWere from your lips: well, well, that is no matter.You came, and in the passion of your eyesI read love's meaning; everything you saidTouched my dumb soul to music, so I loved you.And yet I did not tell you of my love.'Twas you who sought me out, knelt at my feetAs I kneel now at yours, and with sweet vows,[Kneels.]Whose music seems to linger in my ears,Swore that you loved me, and I trusted you.I think there are many women in the worldWho would have tempted you to kill the man.I did not.Yet I know that had I done so,I had not been thus humbled in the dust,[Stands up.]But you had loved me very faithfully.[After a pause approaches him timidly.]I do not think you understand me, Guido:It was for your sake that I wrought this deedWhose horror now chills my young blood to ice,For your sake only. [Stretching out her arm.]Will you not speak to me?Love me a little: in my girlish lifeI have been starved for love, and kindlinessHas passed me by.
GUIDO
I dare not look at you:You come to me with too pronounced a favour;Get to your tirewomen.
DUCHESS
Ay, there it is!There speaks the man! yet had you come to meWith any heavy sin upon your soul,Some murder done for hire, not for love,Why, I had sat and watched at your bedsideAll through the night-time, lest Remorse might comeAnd pour his poisons in your ear, and soKeep you from sleeping! Sure it is the guilty,Who, being very wretched, need love most.
GUIDO
There is no love where there is any guilt.
DUCHESS
No love where there is any guilt! O God,How differently do we love from men!There is many a woman here in Padua,Some workman's wife, or ruder artisan's,Whose husband spends the wages of the weekIn a coarse revel, or a tavern brawl,And reeling home late on the Saturday night,Finds his wife sitting by a fireless hearth,Trying to hush the child who cries for hunger,And then sets to and beats his wife becauseThe child is hungry, and the fire black.Yet the wife loves him! and will rise next dayWith some red bruise across a careworn face,And sweep the house, and do the common service,And try and smile, and only be too gladIf he does not beat her a second timeBefore her child!--that is how women love.[A pause: GUIDO says nothing.]I think you will not drive me from your side.Where have I got to go if you reject me? -You for whose sake this hand has murdered life,You for whose sake my soul has wrecked itselfBeyond all hope of pardon.
GUIDO
Get thee gone:The dead man is a ghost, and our love too,Flits like a ghost about its desolate tomb,And wanders through this charnel house, and weepsThat when you slew your lord you slew it also.Do you not see?
DUCHESS
I see when men love womenThey give them but a little of their lives,But women when they love give everything;I see that, Guido, now.
GUIDO
Away, away,And come not back till you have waked your dead.
DUCHESS
I would to God that I could wake the dead,Put vision in the glazed eves, and giveThe tongue its natural utterance, and bidThe heart to beat again: that cannot be:For what is done, is done: and what is deadIs dead for ever: the fire cannot warm him:The winter cannot hurt him with its snows;Something has gone from him; if you call him now,He will not answer; if you mock him now,He will not laugh; and if you stab him nowHe will not bleed.I would that I could wake him!O God, put back the sun a little space,And from the roll of time blot out to-night,And bid it not have been! Put back the sun,And make me what I was an hour ago!No, no, time will not stop for anything,Nor the sun stay its courses, though RepentanceCalling it back grow hoarse; but you, my love,Have you no word of pity even for me?O Guido, Guido, will you not kiss me once?Drive me not to some desperate resolve:Women grow mad when they are treated thus:Will you not kiss me once?
GUIDO
[holding up knife]I will not kiss youUntil the blood grows dry upon this knife,[Wildly] Back to your dead!
DUCHESS
[going up the stairs]Why, then I will be gone! and may you findMore mercy than you showed to me to-night!
GUIDO
Let me find mercy when I go at nightAnd do foul murder.
DUCHESS
[coming down a few steps.]Murder did you say?Murder is hungry, and still cries for more,And Death, his brother, is not satisfied,But walks the house, and will not go away,Unless he has a comrade! Tarry, Death,For I will give thee a most faithful lackeyTo travel with thee! Murder, call no more,For thou shalt eat thy fill.There is a stormWill break upon this house before the morning,So horrible, that the white moon alreadyTurns grey and sick with terror, the low windGoes moaning round the house, and the high starsRun madly through the vaulted firmament,As though the night wept tears of liquid fireFor what the day shall look upon. Oh, weep,Thou lamentable heaven! Weep thy fill!Though sorrow like a cataract drench the fields,And make the earth one bitter lake of tears,It would not be enough. [A peal of thunder.]Do you not hear,There is artillery in the Heaven to-night.Vengeance is wakened up, and has unloosedHis dogs upon the world, and in this matterWhich lies between us two, let him who drawsThe thunder on his head beware the ruinWhich the forked flame brings after.[A flash of lightning followed by a peal of thunder.]
GUIDO
Away! away![Exit the DUCHESS, who as she lifts the crimson curtain looks backfor a moment at GUIDO, but he makes no sign. More thunder.]Now is life fallen in ashes at my feetAnd noble love self-slain; and in its placeCrept murder with its silent bloody feet.And she who wrought it--Oh! and yet she loved me,And for my sake did do this dreadful thing.I have been cruel to her: Beatrice!Beatrice, I say, come back.[Begins to ascend staircase, when the noise of Soldiers is heard.]Ah! what is that?Torches ablaze, and noise of hurrying feet.Pray God they have not seized her.[Noise grows louder.]Beatrice!There is yet time to escape. Come down, come out![The voice of the DUCHESS outside.]This way went he, the man who slew my lord.[Down the staircase comes hurrying a confused body of Soldiers;GUIDO is not seen at first, till the DUCHESS surrounded by Servantscarrying torches appears at the top of the staircase, and points toGUIDO, who is seized at once, one of the Soldiers dragging theknife from his hand and showing it to the Captain of the Guard insight of the audience.
