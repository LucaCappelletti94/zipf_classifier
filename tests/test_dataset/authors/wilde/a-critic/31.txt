(Pall Mall Gazette, January 3, 1889.)


Prison has had an admirable effect on Mr. Wilfrid Blunt as a poet. The
Love Sonnets of Proteus, in spite of their clever Musset-like
modernities and their swift brilliant wit, were but affected or fantastic
at best. They were simply the records of passing moods and moments, of
which some were sad and others sweet, and not a few shameful. Their
subject was not of high or serious import. They contained much that was
wilful and weak. In Vinculis, upon the other hand, is a book that
stirs one by its fine sincerity of purpose, its lofty and impassioned
thought, its depth and ardour of intense feeling. 'Imprisonment,' says
Mr. Blunt in his preface, 'is a reality of discipline most useful to the
modern soul, lapped as it is in physical sloth and self-indulgence. Like
a sickness or a spiritual retreat it purifies and ennobles; and the soul
emerges from it stronger and more self-contained.' To him, certainly, it
has been a mode of purification. The opening sonnets, composed in the
bleak cell of Galway Gaol, and written down on the flyleaves of the
prisoner's prayer-book, are full of things nobly conceived and nobly
uttered, and show that though Mr. Balfour may enforce 'plain living' by
his prison regulations, he cannot prevent 'high thinking' or in any way
limit or constrain the freedom of a man's soul. They are, of course,
intensely personal in expression. They could not fail to be so. But the
personality that they reveal has nothing petty or ignoble about it. The
petulant cry of the shallow egoist which was the chief characteristic of
the Love Sonnets of Proteus is not to be found here. In its place we
have wild grief and terrible scorn, fierce rage and flame-like passion.
Such a sonnet as the following comes out of the very fire of heart and
brain:

    God knows, 'twas not with a fore-reasoned plan
       I left the easeful dwellings of my peace,
    And sought this combat with ungodly Man,
       And ceaseless still through years that do not cease
       Have warred with Powers and Principalities.
    My natural soul, ere yet these strifes began,
       Was as a sister diligent to please
    And loving all, and most the human clan.
    God knows it.  And He knows how the world's tears
       Touched me.  And He is witness of my wrath,
    How it was kindled against murderers
       Who slew for gold, and how upon their path
    I met them.  Since which day the World in arms
    Strikes at my life with angers and alarms.


And this sonnet has all the strange strength of that despair which is but
the prelude to a larger hope:



    I thought to do a deed of chivalry,
       An act of worth, which haply in her sight
    Who was my mistress should recorded be
       And of the nations.  And, when thus the fight
       Faltered and men once bold with faces white
    Turned this and that way in excuse to flee,
       I only stood, and by the foeman's might
    Was overborne and mangled cruelly.
    Then crawled I to her feet, in whose dear cause
       I made this venture, and 'Behold,' I said,
    'How I am wounded for thee in these wars.'
       But she, 'Poor cripple, would'st thou I should wed
    A limbless trunk?' and laughing turned from me.
    Yet she was fair, and her name 'Liberty.'
The sonnet beginning
    A prison is a convent without God--
       Poverty, Chastity, Obedience
    Its precepts are:
is very fine; and this, written just after entering the gaol, is
powerful:
    Naked I came into the world of pleasure,
       And naked come I to this house of pain.
    Here at the gate I lay down my life's treasure,
       My pride, my garments and my name with men.
       The world and I henceforth shall be as twain,
    No sound of me shall pierce for good or ill
       These walls of grief.  Nor shall I hear the vain
    Laughter and tears of those who love me still.
    Within, what new life waits me!  Little ease,
       Cold lying, hunger, nights of wakefulness,
    Harsh orders given, no voice to soothe or please,
       Poor thieves for friends, for books rules meaningless;
    This is the grave--nay, hell.  Yet, Lord of Might,
    Still in Thy light my spirit shall see light.



But, indeed, all the sonnets are worth reading, and The Canon of
Aughrim, the longest poem in the book, is a most masterly and dramatic
description of the tragic life of the Irish peasant. Literature is not
much indebted to Mr. Balfour for his sophistical Defence of Philosophic
Doubt, which is one of the dullest books we know, but it must be
admitted that by sending Mr. Blunt to gaol he has converted a clever
rhymer into an earnest and deep-thinking poet. The narrow confines of a
prison cell seem to suit the 'sonnet's scanty plot of ground,' and an
unjust imprisonment for a noble cause strengthens as well as deepens the
nature.
