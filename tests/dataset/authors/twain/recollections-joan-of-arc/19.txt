The War March Is Begun
NO L and I went back together--silent at first, and impressed.
Finally Noel came up out of his thinkings and said:
"The first shall be last and the last first--there's authority for thissurprise. But at the same time wasn't it a lofty hoist for our big bull!"
"It truly was; I am not over being stunned yet. It was the greatest placein her gift."
"Yes, it was. There are many generals, and she can create more; but thereis only one Standard-Bearer."
"True. It is the most conspicuous place in the army, after her own."
"And the most coveted and honorable. Sons of two dukes tried to get it,as we know. And of all people in the world, this majestic windmillcarries it off. Well, isn't it a gigantic promotion, when you come tolook at it!"
"There's no doubt about it. It's a kind of copy of Joan's own inminiature."
"I don't know how to account for it--do you?"
"Yes--without any trouble at all--that is, I think I do."
Noel was surprised at that, and glanced up quickly, as if to see if I wasin earnest. He said:
"I thought you couldn't be in earnest, but I see you are. If you can makeme understand this puzzle, do it. Tell me what the explanation is."
"I believe I can. You have noticed that our chief knight says a good manywise things and has a thoughtful head on his shoulders. One day, ridingalong, we were talking about Joan's great talents, and he said, 'But,greatest of all her gifts, she has the seeing eye.' I said, like anunthinking fool, 'The seeing eye?--I shouldn't count on that for much--Isuppose we all have it.' 'No,' he said; 'very few have it.' Then heexplained, and made his meaning clear. He said the common eye sees onlythe outside of things, and judges by that, but the seeing eye piercesthrough and reads the heart and the soul, finding there capacities whichthe outside didn't indicate or promise, and which the other kind of eyecouldn't detect. He said the mightiest military genius must fail and cometo nothing if it have not the seeing eye--that is to say, if it cannotread men and select its subordinates with an infallible judgment. It seesas by intuition that this man is good for strategy, that one for dash anddaredevil assault, the other for patient bulldog persistence, and itappoints each to his right place and wins, while the commander withoutthe seeing eye would give to each the other's place and lose. He wasright about Joan, and I saw it. When she was a child and the tramp cameone night, her father and all of us took him for a rascal, but she sawthe honest man through the rags. When I dined with the governor ofVaucouleurs so long ago, I saw nothing in our two knights, though I satwith them and talked with them two hours; Joan was there five minutes,and neither spoke with them nor heard them speak, yet she marked them formen of worth and fidelity, and they have confirmed her judgment. Whom hasshe sent for to take charge of this thundering rabble of new recruits atBlois, made up of old disbanded Armagnac raiders, unspeakable hellions,every one? Why, she has sent for Satan himself--that is to say, LaHire--that military hurricane, that godless swashbuckler, that luridconflagration of blasphemy, that Vesuvius of profanity, forever ineruption. Does he know how to deal with that mob of roaring devils?Better than any man that lives; for he is the head devil of this worldhis own self, he is the match of the whole of them combined, and probablythe father of most of them. She places him in temporary command until shecan get to Blois herself--and then! Why, then she will certainly takethem in hand personally, or I don't know her as well as I ought to, afterall these years of intimacy. That will be a sight to see--that fairspirit in her white armor, delivering her will to that muck-heap, thatrag-pile, that abandoned refuse of perdition."
"La Hire!" cried Noel, "our hero of all these years--I do want to seethat man!"
"I too. His name stirs me just as it did when I was a little boy."
"I want to hear him swear."
"Of course, I would rather hear him swear than another man pray. He isthe frankest man there is, and the naivest. Once when he was rebuked forpillaging on his raids, he said it was nothing. Said he, 'If God theFather were a soldier, He would rob.' I judge he is the right man to taketemporary charge there at Blois. Joan has cast the seeing eye upon him,you see."
"Which brings us back to where we started. I have an honest affection forthe Paladin, and not merely because he is a good fellow, but because heis my child--I made him what he is, the windiest blusterer and mostcatholic liar in the kingdom. I'm glad of his luck, but I hadn't theseeing eye. I shouldn't have chosen him for the most dangerous post inthe army. I should have placed him in the rear to kill the wounded andviolate the dead."
"Well, we shall see. Joan probably knows what is in him better than wedo. And I'll give you another idea. When a person in Joan of Arc'sposition tells a man he is brave, he believes it; and believing it isenough; in fact, to believe yourself brave is to be brave; it is the oneonly essential thing."
"Now you've hit it!" cried Noel. "She's got the creating mouth as well asthe seeing eye! Ah, yes, that is the thing. France was cowed and acoward; Joan of Arc has spoken, and France is marching, with her headup!"
I was summoned now to write a letter from Joan's dictation. During thenext day and night our several uniforms were made by the tailors, and ournew armor provided. We were beautiful to look upon now, whether clothedfor peace or war. Clothed for peace, in costly stuffs and rich colors,the Paladin was a tower dyed with the glories of the sunset; plumed andsashed and iron-clad for war, he was a still statelier thing to look at.
Orders had been issued for the march toward Blois. It was a clear, sharp,beautiful morning. As our showy great company trotted out in column,riding two and two, Joan and the Duke of Alencon in the lead, D'Aulon andthe big standard-bearer next, and so on, we made a handsome spectacle, asyou may well imagine; and as we plowed through the cheering crowds, withJoan bowing her plumed head to left and right and the sun glinting fromher silver mail, the spectators realized that the curtain was rolling upbefore their eyes upon the first act of a prodigious drama, and theirrising hopes were expressed in an enthusiasm that increased with eachmoment, until at last one seemed to even physically feel the concussionof the huzzas as well as hear them. Far down the street we heard thesoftened strains of wind-blown music, and saw a cloud of lancers moving,the sun glowing with a subdued light upon the massed armor, but strikingbright upon the soaring lance-heads--a vaguely luminous nebula, so tospeak, with a constellation twinkling above it--and that was our guard ofhonor. It joined us, the procession was complete, the first war-march ofJoan of Arc was begun, the curtain was up.
