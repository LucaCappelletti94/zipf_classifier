"I hain't ever done you no harm. You know that.So, then, what you want to come back and ha'nt MEfor?"
I says:
"I hain't come back -- I hain't been GONE."
When he heard my voice it righted him up some, buthe warn't quite satisfied yet. He says:
"Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn'ton you. Honest injun, you ain't a ghost?"
"Honest injun, I ain't," I says.
"Well -- I -- I -- well, that ought to settle it, ofcourse; but I can't somehow seem to understand it noway. Looky here, warn't you ever murdered AT ALL?"
"No. I warn't ever murdered at all -- I played iton them. You come in here and feel of me if youdon't believe me."
So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was thatglad to see me again he didn't know what to do. Andhe wanted to know all about it right off, because it wasa grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit himwhere he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by andby; and told his driver to wait, and we drove off a littlepiece, and I told him the kind of a fix I was in, and whatdid he reckon we better do? He said, let him alone aminute, and don't disturb him. So he thought andthought, and pretty soon he says:
"It's all right; I've got it. Take my trunk in yourwagon, and let on it's your'n; and you turn back andfool along slow, so as to get to the house about thetime you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece,and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a halfan hour after you; and you needn't let on to knowme at first."
I says:
"All right; but wait a minute. There's one morething -- a thing that NOBODY don't know but me. Andthat is, there's a nigger here that I'm a-trying to stealout of slavery, and his name is JIM -- old Miss Wat-son's Jim."
He says:
" What ! Why, Jim is --"
He stopped and went to studying. I says:
"I know what you'll say. You'll say it's dirty, low-down business; but what if it is? I'm low down; andI'm a-going to steal him, and I want you keep mumand not let on. Will you?"
His eye lit up, and he says:
"I'll HELP you steal him!"
Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. Itwas the most astonishing speech I ever heard -- andI'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in myestimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer aNIGGER-STEALER!
"Oh, shucks!" I says; "you're joking."
"I ain't joking, either."
"Well, then," I says, "joking or no joking, if youhear anything said about a runaway nigger, don't for-get to remember that YOU don't know nothing abouthim, and I don't know nothing about him."
Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, andhe drove off his way and I drove mine. But of courseI forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being gladand full of thinking; so I got home a heap too quickfor that length of a trip. The old gentleman was atthe door, and he says:
"Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would athought it was in that mare to do it? I wish we'da timed her. And she hain't sweated a hair -- not ahair. It's wonderful. Why, I wouldn't take a hundreddollars for that horse now -- I wouldn't, honest; andyet I'd a sold her for fifteen before, and thought 'twasall she was worth."
That's all he said. He was the innocentest, best oldsoul I ever see. But it warn't surprising; because hewarn't only just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, andhad a little one-horse log church down back of theplantation, which he built it himself at his own expense,for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged noth-ing for his preaching, and it was worth it, too. Therewas plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and donethe same way, down South.
In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to thefront stile, and Aunt Sally she see it through the win-dow, because it was only about fifty yards, and says:
"Why, there's somebody come! I wonder who'tis? Why, I do believe it's a stranger. Jimmy "(that's one of the children)' "run and tell Lize to puton another plate for dinner."
Everybody made a rush for the front door, because,of course, a stranger don't come EVERY year, and so helays over the yaller-fever, for interest, when he doescome. Tom was over the stile and starting for thehouse; the wagon was spinning up the road for thevillage, and we was all bunched in the front door. Tomhad his store clothes on, and an audience -- and thatwas always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them circum-stances it warn't no trouble to him to throw in anamount of style that was suitable. He warn't a boy tomeeky along up that yard like a sheep; no, he comeca'm and important, like the ram. When he got a-frontof us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like itwas the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it andhe didn't want to disturb them, and says:
"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?"
"No, my boy," says the old gentleman, "I'm sorryto say 't your driver has deceived you; Nichols's placeis down a matter of three mile more. Come in, comein."
Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says,"Too late -- he's out of sight."
"Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come inand eat your dinner with us; and then we'll hitch upand take you down to Nichols's."
"Oh, I CAN'T make you so much trouble; I couldn'tthink of it. I'll walk -- I don't mind the distance."
"But we won't LET you walk -- it wouldn't be South-ern hospitality to do it. Come right in."
"Oh, DO," says Aunt Sally; "it ain't a bit oftrouble to us, not a bit in the world. You must stay.It's a long, dusty three mile, and we can't let you walk.And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on anotherplate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disap-point us. Come right in and make yourself at home."
So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome,and let himself be persuaded, and come in; and whenhe was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville,Ohio, and his name was William Thompson -- and hemade another bow.
Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuffabout Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent,and I getting a little nervious, and wondering how thiswas going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,still talking along, he reached over and kissed AuntSally right on the mouth, and then settled back againin his chair comfortable, and was going on talking; butshe jumped up and wiped it off with the back of herhand, and says:
"You owdacious puppy!"
He looked kind of hurt, and says:
"I'm surprised at you, m'am."
"You're s'rp -- Why, what do you reckon I am?I've a good notion to take and -- Say, what do youmean by kissing me?"
He looked kind of humble, and says:
"I didn't mean nothing, m'am. I didn't mean noharm. I -- I -- thought you'd like it."
"Why, you born fool!" She took up the spinningstick, and it looked like it was all she could do to keepfrom giving him a crack with it. "What made youthink I'd like it?"
"Well, I don't know. Only, they -- they -- toldme you would."
"THEY told you I would. Whoever told you'sANOTHER lunatic. I never heard the beat of it. Who'sTHEY?"
"Why, everybody. They all said so, m'am."
It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyessnapped, and her fingers worked like she wanted toscratch him; and she says:
"Who's 'everybody'? Out with their names, orther'll be an idiot short."
He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled hishat, and says:
"I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. They toldme to. They all told me to. They all said, kiss her;and said she'd like it. They all said it -- every one ofthem. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it nomore -- I won't, honest."
"You won't, won't you? Well, I sh'd RECKON youwon't!"
"No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do itagain -- till you ask me."
"Till I ASK you! Well, I never see the beat of it inmy born days! I lay you'll be the Methusalem-num-skull of creation before ever I ask you -- or the likes ofyou."
"Well," he says, "it does surprise me so. I can'tmake it out, somehow. They said you would, and Ithought you would. But --" He stopped and lookedaround slow, like he wished he could run across afriendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the oldgentleman's, and says, "Didn't YOU think she'd likeme to kiss her, sir?"
"Why, no; I -- I -- well, no, I b'lieve I didn't."
Then he looks on around the same way to me, andsays:
"Tom, didn't YOU think Aunt Sally 'd open out herarms and say, 'Sid Sawyer --'"
"My land!" she says, breaking in and jumping forhim, "you impudent young rascal, to fool a bodyso --" and was going to hug him, but he fended heroff, and says:
"No, not till you've asked me first."
So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; andhugged him and kissed him over and over again, andthen turned him over to the old man, and he took whatwas left. And after they got a little quiet again she says:
"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. Wewarn't looking for YOU at all, but only Tom. Sis neverwrote to me about anybody coming but him."
"It's because it warn't INTENDED for any of us tocome but Tom," he says; "but I begged and begged,and at the last minute she let me come, too; so, com-ing down the river, me and Tom thought it would bea first-rate surprise for him to come here to the housefirst, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in,and let on to be a stranger. But it was a mistake,Aunt Sally. This ain't no healthy place for a strangerto come."
"No -- not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought tohad your jaws boxed; I hain't been so put out since Idon't know when. But I don't care, I don't mindthe terms -- I'd be willing to stand a thousand suchjokes to have you here. Well, to think of that per-formance! I don't deny it, I was most putrified withastonishment when you give me that smack."
We had dinner out in that broad open passage be-twixt the house and the kitchen; and there was thingsenough on that table for seven families -- and all hot,too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid in acupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like ahunk of old cold cannibal in the morning. UncleSilas he asked a pretty long blessing over it, but it wasworth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the wayI've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.There was a considerable good deal of talk all theafternoon, and me and Tom was on the lookout all thetime; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to saynothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraidto try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, oneof the little boys says:
"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"
"No," says the old man, "I reckon there ain't go-ing to be any; and you couldn't go if there was; be-cause the runaway nigger told Burton and me all aboutthat scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell thepeople; so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loaf-ers out of town before this time."
So there it was! -- but I couldn't help it. Tom andme was to sleep in the same room and bed; so, beingtired, we bid good-night and went up to bed right aftersupper, and clumb out of the window and down thelightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn'tbelieve anybody was going to give the king and theduke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up and give themone they'd get into trouble sure.
On the road Tom he told me all about how it wasreckoned I was murdered, and how pap disappearedpretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and whata stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tomall about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and asmuch of the raft voyage as I had time to; and as westruck into the town and up through the  -- here comes araging rush of people with torches, and an awfulwhooping and yelling, and banging tin pans and blow-ing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them goby; and as they went by I see they had the king andthe duke astraddle of a rail -- that is, I knowed it WASthe king and the duke, though they was all over tar andfeathers, and didn't look like nothing in the world thatwas human -- just looked like a couple of monstrousbig soldier-plumes. Well, it made me sick to see it;and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals, it seemedlike I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them anymore in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see.Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another.
We see we was too late -- couldn't do no good. Weasked some stragglers about it, and they said everybodywent to the show looking very innocent; and laidlow and kept dark till the poor old king was in themiddle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebodygive a signal, and the house rose up and went forthem.
So we poked along back home, and I warn't feelingso brash as I was before, but kind of ornery, andhumble, and to blame, somehow -- though I hadn'tdone nothing. But that's always the way; it don'tmake no difference whether you do right or wrong, aperson's conscience ain't got no sense, and just goes forhim anyway. If I had a yaller dog that didn't knowno more than a person's conscience does I would pisonhim. It takes up more room than all the rest of aperson's insides, and yet ain't no good, nohow. TomSawyer he says the same.
