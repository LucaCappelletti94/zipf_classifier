True irreverence is disrespect for another man's god. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
It was in Benares that I saw another living god. That makes two.I believe I have seen most of the greater and lesser wonders of theworld, but I do not remember that any of them interested me sooverwhelmingly as did that pair of gods.
When I try to account for this effect I find no difficulty about it.I find that, as a rule, when a thing is a wonder to us it is not becauseof what we see in it, but because of what others have seen in it. We getalmost all our wonders at second hand. We are eager to see anycelebrated thing--and we never fail of our reward; just the deepprivilege of gazing upon an object which has stirred the enthusiasm orevoked the reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our raceis a thing which we value; we are profoundly glad that we have seen it,we are permanently enriched from having seen it, we would not part withthe memory of that experience for a great price. And yet that veryspectacle may be the Taj. You cannot keep your enthusiasms down, youcannot keep your emotions within bounds when that soaring bubble ofmarble breaks upon your view. But these are not your enthusiasms andemotions--they are the accumulated emotions and enthusiasms of a thousandfervid writers, who have been slowly and steadily storing them up in yourheart day by day and year by year all your life; and now they burst outin a flood and overwhelm you; and you could not be a whit happier if theywere your very own. By and by you sober down, and then you perceive thatyou have been drunk on the smell of somebody else's cork. For ever andever the memory of my distant first glimpse of the Taj will compensate mefor creeping around the globe to have that great privilege.
But the Taj--with all your inflation of delusive emotions, acquired atsecond-hand from people to whom in the majority of cases they were alsodelusions acquired at second-hand--a thing which you fortunately did notthink of or it might have made you doubtful of what you imagined wereyour own what is the Taj as a marvel, a spectacle and an uplifting andoverpowering wonder, compared with a living, breathing, speakingpersonage whom several millions of human beings devoutly and sincerelyand unquestioningly believe to be a God, and humbly and gratefullyworship as a God?
He was sixty years old when I saw him. He is called Sri 108 SwamiBhaskarananda Saraswati. That is one form of it. I think that that iswhat you would call him in speaking to him--because it is short. But youwould use more of his name in addressing a letter to him; courtesy wouldrequire this. Even then you would not have to use all of it, but onlythis much:
Sri 108 Matparamahansrzpairivrajakacharyaswamibhaskaranandasaraswati.
You do not put "Esq." after it, for that is not necessary. The wordwhich opens the volley is itself a title of honor "Sri." The "108"stands for the rest of his names, I believe. Vishnu has 108 names whichhe does not use in business, and no doubt it is a custom of gods and aprivilege sacred to their order to keep 108 extra ones in stock. Justthe restricted name set down above is a handsome property, without the108. By my count it has 58 letters in it. This removes the long Germanwords from competition; they are permanently out of the race.
Sri 108 S. B. Saraswati has attained to what among the Hindoos is calledthe "state of perfection." It is a state which other Hindoos reach bybeing born again and again, and over and over again into this world,through one re-incarnation after another--a tiresome long job coveringcenturies and decades of centuries, and one that is full of risks, too,like the accident of dying on the wrong side of the Ganges some time orother and waking up in the form of an ass, with a fresh start necessaryand the numerous trips to be made all over again. But in reachingperfection, Sri 108 S. B. S. has escaped all that. He is no longer apart or a feature of this world; his substance has changed, allearthiness has departed out of it; he is utterly holy, utterly pure;nothing can desecrate this holiness or stain this purity; he is no longerof the earth, its concerns are matters foreign to him, its pains andgriefs and troubles cannot reach him. When he dies, Nirvana is his; hewill be absorbed into the substance of the Supreme Deity and be at peaceforever.
The Hindoo Scriptures point out how this state is to be reached, but itis only once in a thousand years, perhaps, that candidate accomplishesit. This one has traversed the course required, stage by stage, from thebeginning to the end, and now has nothing left to do but wait for thecall which shall release him from a world in which he has now no part norlot. First, he passed through the student stage, and became learned inthe holy books. Next he became citizen, householder, husband, andfather. That was the required second stage. Then--like John Bunyan'sChristian he bade perpetual good-bye to his family, as required, and wentwandering away. He went far into the desert and served a term as hermit.Next, he became a beggar, "in accordance with the rites laid down in theScriptures," and wandered about India eating the bread of mendicancy. Aquarter of a century ago he reached the stage of purity. This needs nogarment; its symbol is nudity; he discarded the waist-cloth which he hadpreviously worn. He could resume it now if he chose, for neither thatnor any other contact can defile him; but he does not choose.
There are several other stages, I believe, but I do not remember whatthey are. But he has been through them. Throughout the long course hewas perfecting himself in holy learning, and writing commentaries uponthe sacred books. He was also meditating upon Brahma, and he does thatnow.
White marble relief-portraits of him are sold all about India. He livesin a good house in a noble great garden in Benares, all meet and properto his stupendous rank. Necessarily he does not go abroad in thestreets. Deities would never be able to move about handily in anycountry. If one whom we recognized and adored as a god should go abroadin our streets, and the day it was to happen were known, all trafficwould be blocked and business would come to a standstill.
This god is comfortably housed, and yet modestly, all things considered,for if he wanted to live in a palace he would only need to speak and hisworshipers would gladly build it. Sometimes he sees devotees for amoment, and comforts them and blesses them, and they kiss his feet and goaway happy. Rank is nothing to him, he being a god. To him all men arealike. He sees whom he pleases and denies himself to whom he pleases.Sometimes he sees a prince and denies himself to a pauper; at other timeshe receives the pauper and turns the prince away. However, he does notreceive many of either class. He has to husband his time for hismeditations. I think he would receive Rev. Mr. Parker at any time. Ithink he is sorry for Mr. Parker, and I think Mr. Parker is sorry forhim; and no doubt this compassion is good for both of them.
When we arrived we had to stand around in the garden a little while andwait, and the outlook was not good, for he had been turning awayMaharajas that day and receiving only the riff-raff, and we belonged inbetween, somewhere. But presently, a servant came out saying it was allright, he was coming.
And sure enough, he came, and I saw him--that object of the worship ofmillions. It was a strange sensation, and thrilling. I wish I couldfeel it stream through my veins again. And yet, to me he was not a god,he was only a Taj. The thrill was not my thrill, but had come to mesecondhand from those invisible millions of believers. By a hand-shakewith their god I had ground-circuited their wire and got their monsterbattery's whole charge.
He was tall and slender, indeed emaciated. He had a clean cut andconspicuously intellectual face, and a deep and kindly eye. He lookedmany years older than he really was, but much study and meditation andfasting and prayer, with the arid life he had led as hermit and beggar,could account for that. He is wholly nude when he receives natives, ofwhatever rank they may be, but he had white cloth around his loins now, aconcession to Mr. Parker's Europe prejudices, no doubt.
As soon as I had sobered down a little we got along very well together,and I found him a most pleasant and friendly deity. He had heard a dealabout Chicago, and showed a quite remarkable interest in it, for a god.It all came of the World's Fair and the Congress of Religions. If Indiaknows about nothing else American, she knows about those, and will keepthem in mind one while.
He proposed an exchange of autographs, a delicate attention which made mebelieve in him, but I had been having my doubts before. He wrote his inhis book, and I have a reverent regard for that book, though the wordsrun from right to left, and so I can't read it. It was a mistake toprint in that way. It contains his voluminous comments on the Hindooholy writings, and if I could make them out I would try for perfectionmyself. I gave him a copy of Huckleberry Finn. I thought it might resthim up a little to mix it in along with his meditations on Brahma, for helooked tired, and I knew that if it didn't do him any good it wouldn't dohim any harm.
He has a scholar meditating under him--Mina Bahadur Rana--but we did notsee him. He wears clothes and is very imperfect. He has written alittle pamphlet about his master, and I have that. It contains awood-cut of the master and himself seated on a rug in the garden. Theportrait of the master is very good indeed. The posture is exactly thatwhich Brahma himself affects, and it requires long arms and limber legs,and can be accumulated only by gods and the india-rubber man. There is alife-size marble relief of Shri 108, S.B.S. in the garden. Itrepresents him in this same posture.
Dear me! It is a strange world. Particularly the Indian division of it.This pupil, Mina Bahadur Rana, is not a commonplace person, but a man ofdistinguished capacities and attainments, and, apparently, he had a fineworldly career in front of him. He was serving the Nepal Government in ahigh capacity at the Court of the Viceroy of India, twenty years ago. Hewas an able man, educated, a thinker, a man of property. But the longingto devote himself to a religious life came upon him, and he resigned hisplace, turned his back upon the vanities and comforts of the world, andwent away into the solitudes to live in a hut and study the sacredwritings and meditate upon virtue and holiness and seek to attain them.This sort of religion resembles ours. Christ recommended the rich togive away all their property and follow Him in poverty, not in worldlycomfort. American and English millionaires do it every day, and thusverify and confirm to the world the tremendous forces that lie inreligion. Yet many people scoff at them for this loyalty to duty, andmany will scoff at Mina Bahadur Rana and call him a crank. Like manyChristians of great character and intellect, he has made the study of hisScriptures and the writing of books of commentaries upon them the lovinglabor of his life. Like them, he has believed that his was not an idleand foolish waste of his life, but a most worthy and honorable employmentof it. Yet, there are many people who will see in those others, menworthy of homage and deep reverence, but in him merely a crank. But Ishall not. He has my reverence. And I don't offer it as a common thingand poor, but as an unusual thing and of value. The ordinary reverence,the reverence defined and explained by the dictionary costs nothing.Reverence for one's own sacred things--parents, religion, flag, laws, andrespect for one's own beliefs--these are feelings which we cannot evenhelp. They come natural to us; they are involuntary, like breathing.There is no personal merit in breathing. But the reverence which isdifficult, and which has personal merit in it, is the respect which youpay, without compulsion, to the political or religious attitude of a manwhose beliefs are not yours. You can't revere his gods or his politics,and no one expects you to do that, but you could respect his belief inthem if you tried hard enough; and you could respect him, too, if youtried hard enough. But it is very, very difficult; it is next toimpossible, and so we hardly ever try. If the man doesn't believe as wedo, we say he is a crank, and that settles it. I mean it does nowadays,because now we can't burn him.
We are always canting about people's "irreverence," always charging thisoffense upon somebody or other, and thereby intimating that we are betterthan that person and do not commit that offense ourselves. Whenever wedo this we are in a lying attitude, and our speech is cant; for none ofus are reverent--in a meritorious way; deep down in our hearts we are allirreverent. There is probably not a single exception to this rule in theearth. There is probably not one person whose reverence rises higherthan respect for his own sacred things; and therefore, it is not a thingto boast about and be proud of, since the most degraded savage has that--and, like the best of us, has nothing higher. To speak plainly, wedespise all reverences and all objects of reverence which are outside thepale of our own list of sacred things. And yet, with strangeinconsistency, we are shocked when other people despise and defile thethings which are holy to us. Suppose we should meet with a paragraphlike the following, in the newspapers:
"Yesterday a visiting party of the British nobility had a picnic at MountVernon, and in the tomb of Washington they ate their luncheon, sangpopular songs, played games, and danced waltzes and polkas."
Should we be shocked? Should we feel outraged? Should we be amazed?Should we call the performance a desecration? Yes, that would allhappen. We should denounce those people in round terms, and call themhard names.
And suppose we found this paragraph in the newspapers:
"Yesterday a visiting party of American pork-millionaires had a picnic inWestminster Abbey, and in that sacred place they ate their luncheon, sangpopular songs, played games, and danced waltzes and polkas."
Would the English be shocked? Would they feel outraged? Would they beamazed? Would they call the performance a desecration? That would allhappen. The pork-millionaires would be denounced in round terms; theywould be called hard names.
In the tomb at Mount Vernon lie the ashes of America's most honored son;in the Abbey, the ashes of England's greatest dead; the tomb of tombs,the costliest in the earth, the wonder of the world, the Taj, was builtby a great Emperor to honor the memory of a perfect wife and perfectmother, one in whom there was no spot or blemish, whose love was his stayand support, whose life was the light of the world to him; in it herashes lie, and to the Mohammedan millions of India it is a holy place; tothem it is what Mount Vernon is to Americans, it is what the Abbey is tothe English.
Major Sleeman wrote forty or fifty years ago (the italics are mine):
 "I would here enter my humble protest against the quadrille and lunch parties which are sometimes given to European ladies and gentlemen of the station at this imperial tomb; drinking and dancing are no doubt very good things in their season, but they are sadly out of place in a sepulchre."
Were there any Americans among those lunch parties? If they wereinvited, there were.
If my imagined lunch-parties in Westminster and the tomb of Washingtonshould take place, the incident would cause a vast outbreak of bittereloquence about Barbarism and Irreverence; and it would come from twosets of people who would go next day and dance in the Taj if they had achance.
As we took our leave of the Benares god and started away we noticed agroup of natives waiting respectfully just within the gate--a Rajah fromsomewhere in India, and some people of lesser consequence. The godbeckoned them to come, and as we passed out the Rajah was kneeling andreverently kissing his sacred feet.
If Barnum--but Barnum's ambitions are at rest. This god will remain inthe holy peace and seclusion of his garden, undisturbed. Barnum couldnot have gotten him, anyway. Still, he would have found a substitutethat would answer.
