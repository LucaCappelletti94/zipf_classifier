The circling mists and shadows flee,The dawn is rising from the sea,Like a white lady from her bed.
And jagged brazen arrows fallAthwart the feathers of the night,And a long wave of yellow lightBreaks silently on tower and hall,
And spreading wide across the woldWakes into flight some fluttering bird,And all the chestnut tops are stirred,And all the branches streaked with gold.
