The Court Reorganized for Assassination
A HALT was called. It was time. Cauchon was losing ground in the fight,Joan was gaining it.
There were signs that here and there in the court a judge was beingsoftened toward Joan by her courage, her presence of mind, her fortitude,her constancy, her piety, her simplicity and candor, her manifest purity,the nobility of her character, her fine intelligence, and the good bravefight she was making, all friendless and alone, against unfair odds, andthere was grave room for fear that this softening process would spreadfurther and presently bring Cauchon's plans in danger.
Something must be done, and it was done. Cauchon was not distinguishedfor compassion, but he now gave proof that he had it in his character. Hethought it pity to subject so many judges to the prostrating fatigues ofthis trial when it could be conducted plenty well enough by a handful ofthem. Oh, gentle judge! But he did not remember to modify the fatiguesfor the little captive.
He would let all the judges but a handful go, but he would select thehandful himself, and he did.
He chose tigers. If a lamb or two got in, it was by oversight, notintention; and he knew what to do with lambs when discovered.
He called a small council now, and during five days they sifted the hugebulk of answers thus far gathered from Joan. They winnowed it of allchaff, all useless matter--that is, all matter favorable to Joan; theysaved up all matter which could be twisted to her hurt, and out of thisthey constructed a basis for a new trial which should have the semblanceof a continuation of the old one. Another change. It was plain that thepublic trial had wrought damage: its proceedings had been discussed allover the town and had moved many to pity the abused prisoner. Thereshould be no more of that. The sittings should be secret hereafter, andno spectators admitted. So Noel could come no more. I sent this news tohim. I had not the heart to carry it myself. I would give the pain achance to modify before I should see him in the evening.
On the 10th of March the secret trial began. A week had passed since Ihad seen Joan. Her appearance gave me a great shock. She looked tired andweak. She was listless and far away, and her answers showed that she wasdazed and not able to keep perfect run of all that was done and said.Another court would not have taken advantage of her state, seeing thather life was at stake here, but would have adjourned and spared her. Didthis one? No; it worried her for hours, and with a glad and eagerferocity, making all it could out of this great chance, the first one ithad had.
She was tortured into confusing herself concerning the "sign" which hadbeen given the King, and the next day this was continued hour after hour.As a result, she made partial revealments of particulars forbidden by herVoices; and seemed to me to state as facts things which were butallegories and visions mixed with facts.
The third day she was brighter, and looked less worn. She was almost hernormal self again, and did her work well. Many attempts were made tobeguile her into saying indiscreet things, but she saw the purpose inview and answered with tact and wisdom.
"Do you know if St. Catherine and St. Marguerite hate the English?"
"They love whom Our Lord loves, and hate whom He hates."
"Does God hate the English?"
"Of the love or the hatred of God toward the English I know nothing."Then she spoke up with the old martial ring in her voice and the oldaudacity in her words, and added, "But I know this--that God will sendvictory to the French, and that all the English will be flung out ofFrance but the dead ones!"
"Was God on the side of the English when they were prosperous in France?"
"I do not know if God hates the French, but I think that He allowed themto be chastised for their sins."
It was a sufficiently naive way to account for a chastisement which hadnow strung out for ninety-six years. But nobody found fault with it.There was nobody there who would not punish a sinner ninety-six years ifhe could, nor anybody there who would ever dream of such a thing as theLord's being any shade less stringent than men.
"Have you ever embraced St. Marguerite and St. Catherine?"
"Yes, both of them."
The evil face of Cauchon betrayed satisfaction when she said that.
"When you hung garlands upon L'Arbre Fee Bourlemont, did you do it inhonor of your apparitions?"
"No."
Satisfaction again. No doubt Cauchon would take it for granted that shehung them there out of sinful love for the fairies.
"When the saints appeared to you did you bow, did you make reverence, didyou kneel?"
"Yes; I did them the most honor and reverence that I could."
A good point for Cauchon if he could eventually make it appear that thesewere no saints to whom she had done reverence, but devils in disguise.
Now there was the matter of Joan's keeping her supernatural commerce asecret from her parents. Much might be made of that. In fact, particularemphasis had been given to it in a private remark written in the marginof the proces: "She concealed her visions from her parents and from everyone." Possibly this disloyalty to her parents might itself be the sign ofthe satanic source of her mission.
"Do you think it was right to go away to the wars without getting yourparents' leave? It is written one must honor his father and his mother."
"I have obeyed them in all things but that. And for that I have beggedtheir forgiveness in a letter and gotten it."
"Ah, you asked their pardon? So you knew you were guilty of sin in goingwithout their leave!"
Joan was stirred. Her eyes flashed, and she exclaimed:
"I was commanded of God, and it was right to go! If I had had a hundredfathers and mothers and been a king's daughter to boot I would havegone."
"Did you never ask your Voices if you might tell your parents?"
"They were willing that I should tell them, but I would not for anythinghave given my parents that pain."
To the minds of the questioners this headstrong conduct savored of pride.That sort of pride would move one to see sacrilegious adorations.
"Did not your Voices call you Daughter of God?"
Joan answered with simplicity, and unsuspiciously:
"Yes; before the siege of Orleans and since, they have several timescalled me Daughter of God."
Further indications of pride and vanity were sought.
"What horse were you riding when you were captured? Who gave it you?"
"The King."
"You had other things--riches--of the King?"
"For myself I had horses and arms, and money to pay the service in myhousehold."
"Had you not a treasury?"
"Yes. Ten or twelve thousand crowns." Then she said with naivete "It wasnot a great sum to carry on a war with."
"You have it yet?"
"No. It is the King's money. My brothers hold it for him."
"What were the arms which you left as an offering in the church of St.Denis?"
"My suit of silver mail and a sword."
"Did you put them there in order that they might be adored?"
"No. It was but an act of devotion. And it is the custom of men of warwho have been wounded to make such offering there. I had been woundedbefore Paris."
Nothing appealed to these stony hearts, those dull imaginations--not eventhis pretty picture, so simply drawn, of the wounded girl-soldier hangingher toy harness there in curious companionship with the grim and dustyiron mail of the historic defenders of France. No, there was nothing init for them; nothing, unless evil and injury for that innocent creaturecould be gotten out of it somehow.
"Which aided most--you the Standard, or the Standard you?"
"Whether it was the Standard or whether it was I, is nothing--thevictories came from God."
"But did you base your hopes of victory in yourself or in your Standard?"
"In neither. In God, and not otherwise."
"Was not your Standard waved around the King's head at the Coronation?"
"No. It was not."
"Why was it that your Standard had place at the crowning of the King inthe Cathedral of Rheims, rather than those of the other captains?"
Then, soft and low, came that touching speech which will live as long aslanguage lives, and pass into all tongues, and move all gentle heartswheresoever it shall come, down to the latest day:
"It had borne the burden, it had earned the honor." [1] How simple it is,and how beautiful. And how it beggars the studies eloquence of themasters of oratory. Eloquence was a native gift of Joan of Arc; it camefrom her lips without effort and without preparation. Her words were assublime as her deeds, as sublime as her character; they had their sourcein a great heart and were coined in a great brain.
[1] What she said has been many times translated, but never with success.There is a haunting pathos about the original which eludes all efforts toconvey it into our tongue. It is as subtle as an odor, and escapes in thetransmission. Her words were these:
"Il avait t a la peine, c'etait bien raison qu'il fut a l'honneur."
Monseigneur Ricard, Honorary Vicar-General to the Archbishop of Aix,finely speaks of it (Jeanne d'Arc la Venerable, page 197) as "thatsublime reply, enduring in the history of celebrated sayings like the cryof a French and Christian soul wounded unto death in its patriotism andits faith." -- TRANSLATOR.
