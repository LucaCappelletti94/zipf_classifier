I opened my eyes and looked around, tryingto make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and Ihad been sound asleep. Pap was standing over melooking sourQand sick, too. He says:
"What you doin' with this gun?"
I judged he didn't know nothing about what he hadbeen doing, so I says:
"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying forhim."
"Why didn't you roust me out?"
"Well, I tried to, but I couldn't; I couldn't budgeyou."
"Well, all right. Don't stand there palavering allday, but out with you and see if there's a fish on thelines for breakfast. I'll be along in a minute."
He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up theriver-bank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and suchthings floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so Iknowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned Iwould have great times now if I was over at the town.The June rise used to be always luck for me; becauseas soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood float-ing down, and pieces of log rafts -- sometimes a dozenlogs together; so all you have to do is to catch themand sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.
I went along up the bank with one eye out for papand t'other one out for what the rise might fetchalong. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just abeauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long,riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of thebank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out forthe canoe. I just expected there'd be somebody lay-ing down in it, because people often done that to foolfolks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most toit they'd raise up and laugh at him. But it warn't sothis time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and Iclumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the oldman will be glad when he sees this -- she's worth tendollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sightyet, and as I was running her into a little creek like agully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struckanother idea: I judged I'd hide her good, and then,'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd godown the river about fifty mile and camp in one placefor good, and not have such a rough time tramping onfoot.
It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought Iheard the old man coming all the time; but I got herhid; and then I out and looked around a bunch ofwillows, and there was the old man down the patha piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. Sohe hadn't seen anything.
When he got along I was hard at it taking up a"trot" line. He abused me a little for being so slow;but I told him I fell in the river, and that was whatmade me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet,and then he would be asking questions. We got fivecatfish off the lines and went home.
While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both ofus being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I couldfix up some way to keep pap and the widow from tryingto follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trust-ing to luck to get far enough off before they missedme; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well,I didn't see no way for a while, but by and by papraised up a minute to drink another barrel of water,and he says:
"Another time a man comes a-prowling round hereyou roust me out, you hear? That man warn't herefor no good. I'd a shot him. Next time you roustme out, you hear?"
Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; butwhat he had been saying give me the very idea Iwanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobodywon't think of following me.
About twelve o'clock we turned out and went alongup the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast,and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By andby along comes part of a log raft -- nine logs fasttogether. We went out with the skiff and towed itashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but papwould a waited and seen the day through, so as tocatch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style. Ninelogs was enough for one time; he must shove rightover to town and sell. So he locked me in and tookthe skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three. I judged he wouldn't come back thatnight. I waited till I reckoned he had got a goodstart; then I out with my saw, and went to work onthat log again. Before he was t'other side of the riverI was out of the hole; him and his raft was just aspeck on the water away off yonder.
I took the sack of corn meal and took it to wherethe canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branchesapart and put it in; then I done the same with theside of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all thecoffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; Itook the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; Itook a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and twoblankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I tookfish-lines and matches and other things -- everythingthat was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. Iwanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one outat the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leavethat. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.
I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out ofthe hole and dragging out so many things. So Ifixed that as good as I could from the outside byscattering dust on the place, which covered up thesmoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the pieceof log back into its place, and put two rocks under itand one against it to hold it there, for it was bent upat that place and didn't quite touch ground. If youstood four or five foot away and didn't know it wassawed, you wouldn't never notice it; and besides, thiswas the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely anybodywould go fooling around there.
It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left atrack. I followed around to see. I stood on thebank and looked out over the river. All safe. So Itook the gun and went up a piece into the woods, andwas hunting around for some birds when I see a wildpig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after theyhad got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fel-low and took him into camp.
I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat itand hacked it considerable a-doing it. I fetched thepig in, and took him back nearly to the table andhacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him downon the ground to bleed; I say ground because it wasground -- hard packed, and no boards. Well, next Itook an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it -- all Icould drag -- and I started it from the pig, and draggedit to the door and through the woods down to the riverand dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight.You could easy see that something had been draggedover the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there;I knowed he would take an interest in this kind ofbusiness, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobodycould spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thingas that.
Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and bloodedthe axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slungthe axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig and heldhim to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't drip)till I got a good piece below the house and thendumped him into the river. Now I thought of some-thing else. So I went and got the bag of mealand my old saw out of the canoe, and fetchedthem to the house. I took the bag to where itused to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of itwith the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks onthe place -- pap done everything with his clasp-knifeabout the cooking. Then I carried the sack about ahundred yards across the grass and through the willowseast of the house, to a shallow lake that was five milewide and full of rushes -- and ducks too, you mightsay, in the season. There was a slough or a creekleading out of it on the other side that went miles away,I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. Themeal sifted out and made a little track all the way tothe lake. I dropped pap's whetstone there too, so asto look like it had been done by accident. Then I tiedup the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn'tleak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoeagain.
It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoedown the river under some willows that hung over thebank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast toa willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laiddown in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.I says to myself, they'll follow the track of that sack-ful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river forme. And they'll follow that meal track to the lakeand go browsing down the creek that leads out of it tofind the robbers that killed me and took the things.They won't ever hunt the river for anything but mydead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, andwon't bother no more about me. All right; I canstop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is goodenough for me; I know that island pretty well, andnobody ever comes there. And then I can paddleover to town nights, and slink around and pick upthings I want. Jackson's Island's the place.
I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed Iwas asleep. When I woke up I didn't know where Iwas for a minute. I set up and looked around, a littlescared. Then I remembered. The river looked milesand miles across. The moon was so bright I could acounted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, blackand still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Every-thing was dead quiet, and it looked late, and SMELTlate. You know what I mean -- I don't know thewords to put it in.
I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just goingto unhitch and start when I heard a sound away overthe water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. Itwas that dull kind of a regular sound that comes fromoars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. Ipeeped out through the willow branches, and there itwas -- a skiff, away across the water. I couldn't tellhow many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when itwas abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.Think's I, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expectinghim. He dropped below me with the current, andby and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easywater, and he went by so close I could a reached outthe gun and touched him. Well, it WAS pap, sureenough -- and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.
I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade ofthe bank. I made two mile and a half, and thenstruck out a quarter of a mile or more towards themiddle of the river, because pretty soon I would bepassing the ferry landing, and people might see meand hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, andthen laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let herfloat. I laid there, and had a good rest and a smokeout of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not acloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you laydown on your back in the moonshine; I never knowedit before. And how far a body can hear on the watersuch nights! I heard people talking at the ferry land-ing. I heard what they said, too -- every word of it.One man said it was getting towards the long days andthe short nights now. T'other one said THIS warn'tone of the short ones, he reckoned -- and then theylaughed, and he said it over again, and they laughedagain; then they waked up another fellow and toldhim, and laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped outsomething brisk, and said let him alone. The firstfellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman -- shewould think it was pretty good; but he said thatwarn't nothing to some things he had said in his time.I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock, andhe hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about aweek longer. After that the talk got further andfurther away, and I couldn't make out the words anymore; but I could hear the mumble, and now and thena laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.
I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, andthere was Jackson's Island, about two mile and a halfdown stream, heavy timbered and standing up out ofthe middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like asteamboat without any lights. There warn't any signsof the bar at the head -- it was all under water now.
It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past thehead at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, andthen I got into the dead water and landed on the sidetowards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deepdent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to partthe willow branches to get in; and when I made fastnobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.
I went up and set down on a log at the head of theisland, and looked out on the big river and the blackdriftwood and away over to the town, three mileaway, where there was three or four lights twinkling.A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile upstream, coming along down, with a lantern in themiddle of it. I watched it come creeping down, andwhen it was most abreast of where I stood I heard aman say, "Stern oars, there! heave her head to stab-board!" I heard that just as plain as if the man wasby my side.
There was a little gray in the sky now; so I steppedinto the woods, and laid down for a nap before break-fast.
