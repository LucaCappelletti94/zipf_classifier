It is your human environment that makes climate. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Sept. 15--Night. Close to Australia now. Sydney 50 miles distant.
That note recalls an experience. The passengers were sent for, to comeup in the bow and see a fine sight. It was very dark. One could notfollow with the eye the surface of the sea more than fifty yards in anydirection it dimmed away and became lost to sight at about that distancefrom us. But if you patiently gazed into the darkness a little while,there was a sure reward for you. Presently, a quarter of a mile away youwould see a blinding splash or explosion of light on the water--a flashso sudden and so astonishingly brilliant that it would make you catchyour breath; then that blotch of light would instantly extend itself andtake the corkscrew shape and imposing length of the fabled sea-serpent,with every curve of its body and the "break" spreading away from itshead, and the wake following behind its tail clothed in a fierce splendorof living fire. And my, but it was coming at a lightning gait! Almostbefore you could think, this monster of light, fifty feet long, would goflaming and storming by, and suddenly disappear. And out in the distancewhence he came you would see another flash; and another and another andanother, and see them turn into sea-serpents on the instant; and oncesixteen flashed up at the same time and came tearing towards us, a swarmof wiggling curves, a moving conflagration, a vision of bewilderingbeauty, a spectacle of fire and energy whose equal the most of thosepeople will not see again until after they are dead.
It was porpoises--porpoises aglow with phosphorescent light. Theypresently collected in a wild and magnificent jumble under the bows, andthere they played for an hour, leaping and frollicking and carrying on,turning summersaults in front of the stem or across it and never gettinghit, never making a miscalculation, though the stem missed them onlyabout an inch, as a rule. They were porpoises of the ordinary length--eight or ten feet--but every twist of their bodies sent a longprocession of united and glowing curves astern. That fiery jumble wasan enchanting thing to look at, and we stayed out the performance; onecannot have such a show as that twice in a lifetime. The porpoise is thekitten of the sea; he never has a serious thought, he cares for nothingbut fun and play. But I think I never saw him at his winsomest untilthat night. It was near a center of civilization, and he could have beendrinking.
By and by, when we had approached to somewhere within thirty miles ofSydney Heads the great electric light that is posted on one of thoselofty ramparts began to show, and in time the little spark grew to agreat sun and pierced the firmament of darkness with a far-reaching swordof light.
Sydney Harbor is shut in behind a precipice that extends some miles likea wall, and exhibits no break to the ignorant stranger. It has a breakin the middle, but it makes so little show that even Captain Cook sailedby it without seeing it. Near by that break is a false break whichresembles it, and which used to make trouble for the mariner at night, inthe early days before the place was lighted. It caused the memorabledisaster to the Duncan Dunbar, one of the most pathetic tragedies in thehistory of that pitiless ruffian, the sea. The ship was a sailingvessel; a fine and favorite passenger packet, commanded by a popularcaptain of high reputation. She was due from England, and Sydney waswaiting, and counting the hours; counting the hours, and making ready togive her a heart-stirring welcome; for she was bringing back a greatcompany of mothers and daughters, the long-missed light and bloom of lifeof Sydney homes; daughters that had been years absent at school, andmothers that had been with them all that time watching over them. Of allthe world only India and Australasia have by custom freighted ships andfleets with their hearts, and know the tremendous meaning of that phrase;only they know what the waiting is like when this freightage is entrustedto the fickle winds, not steam, and what the joy is like when the shipthat is returning this treasure comes safe to port and the long dread isover.
On board the Duncan Dunbar, flying toward Sydney Heads in the waningafternoon, the happy home-comers made busy preparation, for it was notdoubted that they would be in the arms of their friends before the daywas done; they put away their sea-going clothes and put on clothes meeterfor the meeting, their richest and their loveliest, these poor brides ofthe grave. But the wind lost force, or there was a miscalculation, andbefore the Heads were sighted the darkness came on. It was said thatordinarily the captain would have made a safe offing and waited for themorning; but this was no ordinary occasion; all about him were appealingfaces, faces pathetic with disappointment. So his sympathy moved him totry the dangerous passage in the dark. He had entered the Headsseventeen times, and believed he knew the ground. So he steered straightfor the false opening, mistaking it for the true one. He did not findout that he was wrong until it was too late. There was no saving theship. The great seas swept her in and crushed her to splinters andrubbish upon the rock tushes at the base of the precipice. Not one ofall that fair and gracious company was ever seen again alive. The taleis told to every stranger that passes the spot, and it will continue tobe told to all that come, for generations; but it will never grow old,custom cannot stale it, the heart-break that is in it can never perishout of it.
There were two hundred persons in the ship, and but one survived thedisaster. He was a sailor. A huge sea flung him up the face of theprecipice and stretched him on a narrow shelf of rock midway between thetop and the bottom, and there he lay all night. At any other time hewould have lain there for the rest of his life, without chance ofdiscovery; but the next morning the ghastly news swept through Sydneythat the Duncan Dunbar had gone down in sight of home, and straightwaythe walls of the Heads were black with mourners; and one of these,stretching himself out over the precipice to spy out what might be seenbelow, discovered this miraculously preserved relic of the wreck. Ropeswere brought and the nearly impossible feat of rescuing the man wasaccomplished. He was a person with a practical turn of mind, and hehired a hall in Sydney and exhibited himself at sixpence a head till heexhausted the output of the gold fields for that year.
We entered and cast anchor, and in the morning went oh-ing and ah-ing inadmiration up through the crooks and turns of the spacious and beautifulharbor--a harbor which is the darling of Sydney and the wonder of theworld. It is not surprising that the people are proud of it, nor thatthey put their enthusiasm into eloquent words. A returning citizen askedme what I thought of it, and I testified with a cordiality which I judgedwould be up to the market rate. I said it was beautiful--superblybeautiful. Then by a natural impulse I gave God the praise. The citizendid not seem altogether satisfied. He said:
"It is beautiful, of course it's beautiful--the Harbor; but that isn'tall of it, it's only half of it; Sydney's the other half, and it takesboth of them together to ring the supremacy-bell. God made the Harbor,and that's all right; but Satan made Sydney."
Of course I made an apology; and asked him to convey it to his friend.He was right about Sydney being half of it. It would be beautifulwithout Sydney, but not above half as beautiful as it is now, with Sydneyadded. It is shaped somewhat like an oak-leaf-a roomy sheet of lovelyblue water, with narrow off-shoots of water running up into the countryon both sides between long fingers of land, high wooden ridges with sidessloped like graves. Handsome villas are perched here and there on theseridges, snuggling amongst the foliage, and one catches alluring glimpsesof them as the ship swims by toward the city. The city clothes a clusterof hills and a ruffle of neighboring ridges with its undulating masses ofmasonry, and out of these masses spring towers and spires and otherarchitectural dignities and grandeurs that break the flowing lines andgive picturesqueness to the general effect.
The narrow inlets which I have mentioned go wandering out into the landeverywhere and hiding themselves in it, and pleasure-launches are alwaysexploring them with picnic parties on board. It is said by trustworthypeople that if you explore them all you will find that you have covered700 miles of water passage. But there are liars everywhere this year,and they will double that when their works are in good going order.October was close at hand, spring was come. It was really spring--everybody said so; but you could have sold it for summer in Canada, andnobody would have suspected. It was the very weather that makes our homesummers the perfection of climatic luxury; I mean, when you are out inthe wood or by the sea. But these people said it was cool, now--a personought to see Sydney in the summer time if he wanted to know what warmweather is; and he ought to go north ten or fifteen hundred miles if hewanted to know what hot weather is. They said that away up there towardthe equator the hens laid fried eggs. Sydney is the place to go to getinformation about other people's climates. It seems to me that theoccupation of Unbiased Traveler Seeking Information is the pleasantestand most irresponsible trade there is. The traveler can always find outanything he wants to, merely by asking. He can get at all the facts, andmore. Everybody helps him, nobody hinders him. Anybody who has an oldfact in stock that is no longer negotiable in the domestic market willlet him have it at his own price. An accumulation of such goods iseasily and quickly made. They cost almost nothing and they bring par inthe foreign market. Travelers who come to America always freight up withthe same old nursery tales that their predecessors selected, and theycarry them back and always work them off without any trouble in the homemarket.
If the climates of the world were determined by parallels of latitude,then we could know a place's climate by its position on the map; and sowe should know that the climate of Sydney was the counterpart of theclimate of Columbia, S. C., and of Little Rock, Arkansas, since Sydney isabout the same distance south of the equator that those other towns arenorth of-it-thirty-four degrees. But no, climate disregards theparallels of latitude. In Arkansas they have a winter; in Sydney theyhave the name of it, but not the thing itself. I have seen the ice inthe Mississippi floating past the mouth of the Arkansas river; and atMemphis, but a little way above, the Mississippi has been frozen over,from bank to bank. But they have never had a cold spell in Sydney whichbrought the mercury down to freezing point. Once in a mid-winter daythere, in the month of July, the mercury went down to 36 deg., and thatremains the memorable "cold day" in the history of the town. No doubtLittle Rock has seen it below zero. Once, in Sydney, in mid-summer,about New Year's Day, the mercury went up to 106 deg. in the shade, andthat is Sydney's memorable hot day. That would about tally with LittleRock's hottest day also, I imagine. My Sydney figures are taken from agovernment report, and are trustworthy. In the matter of summer weatherArkansas has no advantage over Sydney, perhaps, but when it comes towinter weather, that is another affair. You could cut up an Arkansaswinter into a hundred Sydney winters and have enough left for Arkansasand the poor.
The whole narrow, hilly belt of the Pacific side of New South Wales hasthe climate of its capital--a mean winter temperature of 54 deg. and amean summer one of 71 deg. It is a climate which cannot be improved uponfor healthfulness. But the experts say that 90 deg. in New South Walesis harder to bear than 112 deg. in the neighboring colony of Victoria,because the atmosphere of the former is humid, and of the latter dry.The mean temperature of the southernmost point of New South Wales is thesame as that of Nice--60 deg.--yet Nice is further from the equator by460 miles than is the former.
But Nature is always stingy of perfect climates; stingier in the case ofAustralia than usual. Apparently this vast continent has a really goodclimate nowhere but around the edges.
If we look at a map of the world we are surprised to see how bigAustralia is. It is about two-thirds as large as the United States wasbefore we added Alaska.
But where as one finds a sufficiently good climate and fertile landalmost everywhere in the United States, it seems settled that inside ofthe Australian border-belt one finds many deserts and in spots a climatewhich nothing can stand except a few of the hardier kinds of rocks. Ineffect, Australia is as yet unoccupied. If you take a map of the UnitedStates and leave the Atlantic sea-board States in their places; also thefringe of Southern States from Florida west to the Mouth of theMississippi; also a narrow, inhabited streak up the Mississippi half-wayto its head waters; also a narrow, inhabited border along the Pacificcoast: then take a brushful of paint and obliterate the whole remainingmighty stretch of country that lies between the Atlantic States and thePacific-coast strip, your map will look like the latest map of Australia.
This stupendous blank is hot, not to say torrid; a part of it is fertile,the rest is desert; it is not liberally watered; it has no towns. Onehas only to cross the mountains of New South Wales and descend into thewestward-lying regions to find that he has left the choice climate behindhim, and found a new one of a quite different character. In fact, hewould not know by the thermometer that he was not in the blisteringPlains of India. Captain Sturt, the great explorer, gives us a sample ofthe heat.
 "The wind, which had been blowing all the morning from the N.E., increased to a heavy gale, and I shall never forget its withering effect. I sought shelter behind a large gum-tree, but the blasts of heat were so terrific that I wondered the very grass did not take fire. This really was nothing ideal: everything both animate and inanimate gave way before it; the horses stood with their backs to the wind and their noses to the ground, without the muscular strength to raise their heads; the birds were mute, and the leaves of the trees under which we were sitting fell like a snow shower around us. At noon I took a thermometer graded to 127 deg., out of my box, and observed that the mercury was up to 125. Thinking that it had been unduly influenced, I put it in the fork of a tree close to me, sheltered alike from the wind and the sun. I went to examine it about an hour afterwards, when I found the mercury had risen to the-top of the instrument and had burst the bulb, a circumstance that I believe no traveler has ever before had to record. I cannot find language to convey to the reader's mind an idea of the intense and oppressive nature of the heat that prevailed."
That hot wind sweeps over Sydney sometimes, and brings with it what iscalled a "dust-storm." It is said that most Australian towns areacquainted with the dust-storm. I think I know what it is like, for thefollowing description by Mr. Gape tallies very well with the alkaliduststorm of Nevada, if you leave out the "shovel" part. Still theshovel part is a pretty important part, and seems to indicate that myNevada storm is but a poor thing, after all.
 "As we proceeded the altitude became less, and the heat proportionately greater until we reached Dubbo, which is only 600 feet above sea-level. It is a pretty town, built on an extensive plain . . . . After the effects of a shower of rain have passed away the surface of the ground crumbles into a thick layer of dust, and occasionally, when the wind is in a particular quarter, it is lifted bodily from the ground in one long opaque cloud. In the midst of such a storm nothing can be seen a few yards ahead, and the unlucky person who happens to be out at the time is compelled to seek the nearest retreat at hand. When the thrifty housewife sees in the distance the dark column advancing in a steady whirl towards her house, she closes the doors and windows with all expedition. A drawing-room, the window of which has been carelessly left open during a dust-storm, is indeed an extraordinary sight. A lady who has resided in Dubbo for some years says that the dust lies so thick on the carpet that it is necessary to use a shovel to remove it."
And probably a wagon. I was mistaken; I have not seen a properduststorm. To my mind the exterior aspects and character of Australiaare fascinating things to look at and think about, they are so strange,so weird, so new, so uncommonplace, such a startling and interestingcontrast to the other sections of the planet, the sections that are knownto us all, familiar to us all. In the matter of particulars--a detailhere, a detail there--we have had the choice climate of New South Wales'seacoast; we have had the Australian heat as furnished by Captain Sturt;we have had the wonderful dust-storm; and we have considered thephenomenon of an almost empty hot wilderness half as big as the UnitedStates, with a narrow belt of civilization, population, and good climatearound it.
