  Since I lost you I am silence-haunted,	 Sounds wave their little wings	A moment, then in weariness settle	 On the flood that soundless swings.	 Whether the people in the street  Like pattering ripples go by,	Or whether the theatre sighs and sighs	 With a loud, hoarse sigh:	 Or the wind shakes a ravel of light	 Over the dead-black river, Or night's last echoing	 Makes the daybreak shiver:	 I feel the silence waiting	 To take them all up again	In its vast completeness, enfolding  The sound of men.
