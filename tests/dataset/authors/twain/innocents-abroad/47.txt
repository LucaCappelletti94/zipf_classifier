We traversed some miles of desolate country whose soil is rich enough,but is given over wholly to weeds--a silent, mournful expanse, wherein wesaw only three persons--Arabs, with nothing on but a long coarse shirtlike the "tow-linen" shirts which used to form the only summer garment oflittle negro boys on Southern plantations. Shepherds they were, and theycharmed their flocks with the traditional shepherd's pipe--a reedinstrument that made music as exquisitely infernal as these same Arabscreate when they sing.
In their pipes lingered no echo of the wonderful music the shepherdforefathers heard in the Plains of Bethlehem what time the angels sang"Peace on earth, good will to men."
Part of the ground we came over was not ground at all, butrocks--cream-colored rocks, worn smooth, as if by water; with seldom anedge or a corner on them, but scooped out, honey-combed, bored out witheye-holes, and thus wrought into all manner of quaint shapes, amongwhich the uncouth imitation of skulls was frequent. Over this part ofthe route were occasional remains of an old Roman road like the AppianWay, whose paving-stones still clung to their places with Romantenacity.
Gray lizards, those heirs of ruin, of sepulchres and desolation, glidedin and out among the rocks or lay still and sunned themselves. Whereprosperity has reigned, and fallen; where glory has flamed, and gone out;where beauty has dwelt, and passed away; where gladness was, and sorrowis; where the pomp of life has been, and silence and death brood in itshigh places, there this reptile makes his home, and mocks at humanvanity. His coat is the color of ashes: and ashes are the symbol ofhopes that have perished, of aspirations that came to nought, of lovesthat are buried. If he could speak, he would say, Build temples: I willlord it in their ruins; build palaces: I will inhabit them; erectempires: I will inherit them; bury your beautiful: I will watch the wormsat their work; and you, who stand here and moralize over me: I will crawlover your corpse at the last.
A few ants were in this desert place, but merely to spend the summer.They brought their provisions from Ain Mellahah--eleven miles.
Jack is not very well to-day, it is easy to see; but boy as he is, he istoo much of a man to speak of it. He exposed himself to the sun too muchyesterday, but since it came of his earnest desire to learn, and to makethis journey as useful as the opportunities will allow, no one seeks todiscourage him by fault-finding. We missed him an hour from the camp,and then found him some distance away, by the edge of a brook, and withno umbrella to protect him from the fierce sun. If he had been used togoing without his umbrella, it would have been well enough, of course;but he was not. He was just in the act of throwing a clod at amud-turtle which was sunning itself on a small log in the brook.We said:
"Don't do that, Jack. What do you want to harm him for? What has hedone?"
"Well, then, I won't kill him, but I ought to, because he is a fraud."
We asked him why, but he said it was no matter. We asked him why, onceor twice, as we walked back to the camp but he still said it was nomatter. But late at night, when he was sitting in a thoughtful mood onthe bed, we asked him again and he said:
"Well, it don't matter; I don't mind it now, but I did not like it today,you know, because I don't tell any thing that isn't so, and I don't thinkthe Colonel ought to, either. But he did; he told us at prayers in thePilgrims' tent, last night, and he seemed as if he was reading it out ofthe Bible, too, about this country flowing with milk and honey, and aboutthe voice of the turtle being heard in the land. I thought that wasdrawing it a little strong, about the turtles, any how, but I asked Mr.Church if it was so, and he said it was, and what Mr. Church tells me, Ibelieve. But I sat there and watched that turtle nearly an hour today,and I almost burned up in the sun; but I never heard him sing. I believeI sweated a double handful of sweat---I know I did--because it got in myeyes, and it was running down over my nose all the time; and you know mypants are tighter than any body else's--Paris foolishness--and thebuckskin seat of them got wet with sweat, and then got dry again andbegan to draw up and pinch and tear loose--it was awful--but I neverheard him sing. Finally I said, This is a fraud--that is what it is, itis a fraud--and if I had had any sense I might have known a cursedmud-turtle couldn't sing. And then I said, I don't wish to be hard onthis fellow, and I will just give him ten minutes to commence; tenminutes--and then if he don't, down goes his building. But he didn'tcommence, you know. I had staid there all that time, thinking may be hemight, pretty soon, because he kept on raising his head up and lettingit down, and drawing the skin over his eyes for a minute and thenopening them out again, as if he was trying to study up something tosing, but just as the ten minutes were up and I was all beat out andblistered, he laid his blamed head down on a knot and went fast asleep."
"It was a little hard, after you had waited so long."
"I should think so. I said, Well, if you won't sing, you shan't sleep,any way; and if you fellows had let me alone I would have made him shinout of Galilee quicker than any turtle ever did yet. But it isn't anymatter now--let it go. The skin is all off the back of my neck."
About ten in the morning we halted at Joseph's Pit. This is a ruinedKhan of the Middle Ages, in one of whose side courts is a great walledand arched pit with water in it, and this pit, one tradition says, is theone Joseph's brethren cast him into. A more authentic tradition, aidedby the geography of the country, places the pit in Dothan, some two days'journey from here. However, since there are many who believe in thispresent pit as the true one, it has its interest.
It is hard to make a choice of the most beautiful passage in a book whichis so gemmed with beautiful passages as the Bible; but it is certain thatnot many things within its lids may take rank above the exquisite storyof Joseph. Who taught those ancient writers their simplicity oflanguage, their felicity of expression, their pathos, and above all,their faculty of sinking themselves entirely out of sight of the readerand making the narrative stand out alone and seem to tell itself?Shakspeare is always present when one reads his book; Macaulay is presentwhen we follow the march of his stately sentences; but the Old Testamentwriters are hidden from view.
If the pit I have been speaking of is the right one, a scene transpiredthere, long ages ago, which is familiar to us all in pictures. The sonsof Jacob had been pasturing their flocks near there. Their father grewuneasy at their long absence, and sent Joseph, his favorite, to see ifany thing had gone wrong with them. He traveled six or seven days'journey; he was only seventeen years old, and, boy like, he toiledthrough that long stretch of the vilest, rockiest, dustiest country inAsia, arrayed in the pride of his heart, his beautiful claw-hammer coatof many colors. Joseph was the favorite, and that was one crime in theeyes of his brethren; he had dreamed dreams, and interpreted them toforeshadow his elevation far above all his family in the far future, andthat was another; he was dressed well and had doubtless displayed theharmless vanity of youth in keeping the fact prominently before hisbrothers. These were crimes his elders fretted over among themselves andproposed to punish when the opportunity should offer. When they saw himcoming up from the Sea of Galilee, they recognized him and were glad.They said, "Lo, here is this dreamer--let us kill him." But Reubenpleaded for his life, and they spared it. But they seized the boy, andstripped the hated coat from his back and pushed him into the pit. Theyintended to let him die there, but Reuben intended to liberate himsecretly. However, while Reuben was away for a little while, thebrethren sold Joseph to some Ishmaelitish merchants who were journeyingtowards Egypt. Such is the history of the pit. And the self-same pit isthere in that place, even to this day; and there it will remain until thenext detachment of image-breakers and tomb desecraters arrives from theQuaker City excursion, and they will infallibly dig it up and carry itaway with them. For behold in them is no reverence for the solemnmonuments of the past, and whithersoever they go they destroy and sparenot.
Joseph became rich, distinguished, powerful--as the Bible expresses it,"lord over all the land of Egypt." Joseph was the real king, thestrength, the brain of the monarchy, though Pharaoh held the title.Joseph is one of the truly great men of the Old Testament. And he wasthe noblest and the manliest, save Esau. Why shall we not say a goodword for the princely Bedouin? The only crime that can be broughtagainst him is that he was unfortunate. Why must every body praiseJoseph's great-hearted generosity to his cruel brethren, without stint offervent language, and fling only a reluctant bone of praise to Esau forhis still sublimer generosity to the brother who had wronged him? Jacobtook advantage of Esau's consuming hunger to rob him of his birthrightand the great honor and consideration that belonged to the position; bytreachery and falsehood he robbed him of his father's blessing; he madeof him a stranger in his home, and a wanderer. Yet after twenty yearshad passed away and Jacob met Esau and fell at his feet quaking with fearand begging piteously to be spared the punishment he knew he deserved,what did that magnificent savage do? He fell upon his neck and embracedhim! When Jacob--who was incapable of comprehending nobility ofcharacter--still doubting, still fearing, insisted upon "finding gracewith my lord" by the bribe of a present of cattle, what did the gorgeousson of the desert say?
"Nay, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself!"
Esau found Jacob rich, beloved by wives and children, and traveling instate, with servants, herds of cattle and trains of camels--but hehimself was still the uncourted outcast this brother had made him. Afterthirteen years of romantic mystery, the brethren who had wronged Joseph,came, strangers in a strange land, hungry and humble, to buy "a littlefood"; and being summoned to a palace, charged with crime, they beheld inits owner their wronged brother; they were trembling beggars--he, thelord of a mighty empire! What Joseph that ever lived would have thrownaway such a chance to "show off?" Who stands first--outcast Esauforgiving Jacob in prosperity, or Joseph on a king's throne forgiving theragged tremblers whose happy rascality placed him there?
Just before we came to Joseph's Pit, we had "raised" a hill, and there, afew miles before us, with not a tree or a shrub to interrupt the view,lay a vision which millions of worshipers in the far lands of the earthwould give half their possessions to see--the sacred Sea of Galilee!
Therefore we tarried only a short time at the pit. We rested the horsesand ourselves, and felt for a few minutes the blessed shade of theancient buildings. We were out of water, but the two or three scowlingArabs, with their long guns, who were idling about the place, said theyhad none and that there was none in the vicinity. They knew there was alittle brackish water in the pit, but they venerated a place made sacredby their ancestor's imprisonment too much to be willing to see Christiandogs drink from it. But Ferguson tied rags and handkerchiefs togethertill he made a rope long enough to lower a vessel to the bottom, and wedrank and then rode on; and in a short time we dismounted on those shoreswhich the feet of the Saviour have made holy ground.
At noon we took a swim in the Sea of Galilee--a blessed privilege in thisroasting climate--and then lunched under a neglected old fig-tree at thefountain they call Ain-et-Tin, a hundred yards from ruined Capernaum.Every rivulet that gurgles out of the rocks and sands of this part of theworld is dubbed with the title of "fountain," and people familiar withthe Hudson, the great lakes and the Mississippi fall into transports ofadmiration over them, and exhaust their powers of composition in writingtheir praises. If all the poetry and nonsense that have been dischargedupon the fountains and the bland scenery of this region were collected ina book, it would make a most valuable volume to burn.
During luncheon, the pilgrim enthusiasts of our party, who had been solight-hearted and so happy ever since they touched holy ground that theydid little but mutter incoherent rhapsodies, could scarcely eat, soanxious were they to "take shipping" and sail in very person upon thewaters that had borne the vessels of the Apostles. Their anxiety grewand their excitement augmented with every fleeting moment, until my fearswere aroused and I began to have misgivings that in their presentcondition they might break recklessly loose from all considerations ofprudence and buy a whole fleet of ships to sail in instead of hiring asingle one for an hour, as quiet folk are wont to do. I trembled tothink of the ruined purses this day's performances might result in.I could not help reflecting bodingly upon the intemperate zeal with whichmiddle-aged men are apt to surfeit themselves upon a seductive follywhich they have tasted for the first time. And yet I did not feel thatI had a right to be surprised at the state of things which was giving meso much concern. These men had been taught from infancy to revere,almost to worship, the holy places whereon their happy eyes were restingnow. For many and many a year this very picture had visited theirthoughts by day and floated through their dreams by night. To standbefore it in the flesh--to see it as they saw it now--to sail upon thehallowed sea, and kiss the holy soil that compassed it about: these wereaspirations they had cherished while a generation dragged its laggingseasons by and left its furrows in their faces and its frosts upon theirhair. To look upon this picture, and sail upon this sea, they hadforsaken home and its idols and journeyed thousands and thousands ofmiles, in weariness and tribulation. What wonder that the sordid lightsof work-day prudence should pale before the glory of a hope like theirsin the full splendor of its fruition? Let them squander millions!I said--who speaks of money at a time like this?
In this frame of mind I followed, as fast as I could, the eager footstepsof the pilgrims, and stood upon the shore of the lake, and swelled, withhat and voice, the frantic hail they sent after the "ship" that wasspeeding by. It was a success. The toilers of the sea ran in andbeached their barque. Joy sat upon every countenance.
"How much?--ask him how much, Ferguson!--how much to take us all--eightof us, and you--to Bethsaida, yonder, and to the mouth of Jordan, and tothe place where the swine ran down into the sea--quick!--and we want tocoast around every where--every where!--all day long!--I could sail ayear in these waters!--and tell him we'll stop at Magdala and finish atTiberias!--ask him how much?--any thing--any thing whatever!--tell him wedon't care what the expense is!" [I said to myself, I knew how it wouldbe.]
Ferguson--(interpreting)--"He says two Napoleons--eight dollars."
One or two countenances fell. Then a pause.
"Too much!--we'll give him one!"
I never shall know how it was--I shudder yet when I think how the placeis given to miracles--but in a single instant of time, as it seemed tome, that ship was twenty paces from the shore, and speeding away like afrightened thing! Eight crestfallen creatures stood upon the shore, andO, to think of it! this--this--after all that overmastering ecstacy!Oh, shameful, shameful ending, after such unseemly boasting! It was toomuch like "Ho! let me at him!" followed by a prudent "Two of you holdhim--one can hold me!"
Instantly there was wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp. The twoNapoleons were offered--more if necessary--and pilgrims and dragomanshouted themselves hoarse with pleadings to the retreating boatmen tocome back. But they sailed serenely away and paid no further heed topilgrims who had dreamed all their lives of some day skimming over thesacred waters of Galilee and listening to its hallowed story in thewhisperings of its waves, and had journeyed countless leagues to do it,and--and then concluded that the fare was too high. ImpertinentMohammedan Arabs, to think such things of gentlemen of another faith!
Well, there was nothing to do but just submit and forego the privilege ofvoyaging on Genessaret, after coming half around the globe to taste thatpleasure. There was a time, when the Saviour taught here, that boatswere plenty among the fishermen of the coasts--but boats and fishermenboth are gone, now; and old Josephus had a fleet of men-of-war in thesewaters eighteen centuries ago--a hundred and thirty bold canoes--butthey, also, have passed away and left no sign. They battle here no moreby sea, and the commercial marine of Galilee numbers only two smallships, just of a pattern with the little skiffs the disciples knew. Onewas lost to us for good--the other was miles away and far out of hail.So we mounted the horses and rode grimly on toward Magdala, canteringalong in the edge of the water for want of the means of passing over it.
How the pilgrims abused each other! Each said it was the other's fault,and each in turn denied it. No word was spoken by the sinners--even themildest sarcasm might have been dangerous at such a time. Sinners thathave been kept down and had examples held up to them, and sufferedfrequent lectures, and been so put upon in a moral way and in the matterof going slow and being serious and bottling up slang, and so crowded inregard to the matter of being proper and always and forever behaving,that their lives have become a burden to them, would not lag behindpilgrims at such a time as this, and wink furtively, and be joyful, andcommit other such crimes--because it would not occur to them to do it.Otherwise they would. But they did do it, though--and it did them aworld of good to hear the pilgrims abuse each other, too. We took anunworthy satisfaction in seeing them fall out, now and then, because itshowed that they were only poor human people like us, after all.
So we all rode down to Magdala, while the gnashing of teeth waxed andwaned by turns, and harsh words troubled the holy calm of Galilee.
Lest any man think I mean to be ill-natured when I talk about ourpilgrims as I have been talking, I wish to say in all sincerity that I donot. I would not listen to lectures from men I did not like and couldnot respect; and none of these can say I ever took their lecturesunkindly, or was restive under the infliction, or failed to try to profitby what they said to me. They are better men than I am; I can say thathonestly; they are good friends of mine, too--and besides, if they didnot wish to be stirred up occasionally in print, why in the mischief didthey travel with me? They knew me. They knew my liberal way--that Ilike to give and take--when it is for me to give and other people totake. When one of them threatened to leave me in Damascus when I had thecholera, he had no real idea of doing it--I know his passionate natureand the good impulses that underlie it. And did I not overhear Church,another pilgrim, say he did not care who went or who staid, he wouldstand by me till I walked out of Damascus on my own feet or was carriedout in a coffin, if it was a year? And do I not include Church everytime I abuse the pilgrims--and would I be likely to speak ill-naturedlyof him? I wish to stir them up and make them healthy; that is all.
We had left Capernaum behind us. It was only a shapeless ruin. It boreno semblance to a town, and had nothing about it to suggest that it hadever been a town. But all desolate and unpeopled as it was, it wasillustrious ground. From it sprang that tree of Christianity whose broadarms overshadow so many distant lands to-day. After Christ was temptedof the devil in the desert, he came here and began his teachings; andduring the three or four years he lived afterward, this place was hishome almost altogether. He began to heal the sick, and his fame soonspread so widely that sufferers came from Syria and beyond Jordan, andeven from Jerusalem, several days' journey away, to be cured of theirdiseases. Here he healed the centurion's servant and Peter'smother-in-law, and multitudes of the lame and the blind and personspossessed of devils; and here, also, he raised Jairus's daughter fromthe dead. He went into a ship with his disciples, and when they rousedhim from sleep in the midst of a storm, he quieted the winds and lulledthe troubled sea to rest with his voice. He passed over to the otherside, a few miles away and relieved two men of devils, which passed intosome swine. After his return he called Matthew from the receipt ofcustoms, performed some cures, and created scandal by eating withpublicans and sinners. Then he went healing and teaching throughGalilee, and even journeyed to Tyre and Sidon. He chose the twelvedisciples, and sent them abroad to preach the new gospel. He workedmiracles in Bethsaida and Chorazin--villages two or three miles fromCapernaum. It was near one of them that the miraculous draft of fishesis supposed to have been taken, and it was in the desert places near theother that he fed the thousands by the miracles of the loaves andfishes. He cursed them both, and Capernaum also, for not repenting,after all the great works he had done in their midst, and prophesiedagainst them. They are all in ruins, now--which is gratifying to thepilgrims, for, as usual, they fit the eternal words of gods to theevanescent things of this earth; Christ, it is more probable, referredto the people, not their shabby villages of wigwams: he said it would besad for them at "the day of judgment"--and what business have mud-hovelsat the Day of Judgment? It would not affect the prophecy in the least--it would neither prove it or disprove it--if these towns were splendidcities now instead of the almost vanished ruins they are. Christ visitedMagdala, which is near by Capernaum, and he also visited CesareaPhilippi. He went up to his old home at Nazareth, and saw his brothersJoses, and Judas, and James, and Simon--those persons who, being ownbrothers to Jesus Christ, one would expect to hear mentioned sometimes,yet who ever saw their names in a newspaper or heard them from a pulpit?Who ever inquires what manner of youths they were; and whether theyslept with Jesus, played with him and romped about him; quarreled withhim concerning toys and trifles; struck him in anger, not suspectingwhat he was? Who ever wonders what they thought when they saw him comeback to Nazareth a celebrity, and looked long at his unfamiliar face tomake sure, and then said, "It is Jesus?" Who wonders what passed intheir minds when they saw this brother, (who was only a brother to them,however much he might be to others a mysterious stranger who was a godand had stood face to face with God above the clouds,) doing strangemiracles with crowds of astonished people for witnesses? Who wonders ifthe brothers of Jesus asked him to come home with them, and said hismother and his sisters were grieved at his long absence, and would bewild with delight to see his face again? Who ever gives a thought tothe sisters of Jesus at all?--yet he had sisters; and memories of themmust have stolen into his mind often when he was ill-treated amongstrangers; when he was homeless and said he had not where to lay hishead; when all deserted him, even Peter, and he stood alone among hisenemies.
Christ did few miracles in Nazareth, and staid but a little while. Thepeople said, "This the Son of God! Why, his father is nothing but acarpenter. We know the family. We see them every day. Are not hisbrothers named so and so, and his sisters so and so, and is not hismother the person they call Mary? This is absurd." He did not curse hishome, but he shook its dust from his feet and went away.
Capernaum lies close to the edge of the little sea, in a small plain somefive miles long and a mile or two wide, which is mildly adorned witholeanders which look all the better contrasted with the bald hills andthe howling deserts which surround them, but they are not as deliriouslybeautiful as the books paint them. If one be calm and resolute he canlook upon their comeliness and live.
One of the most astonishing things that have yet fallen under ourobservation is the exceedingly small portion of the earth from whichsprang the now flourishing plant of Christianity. The longest journeyour Saviour ever performed was from here to Jerusalem--about one hundredto one hundred and twenty miles. The next longest was from here toSidon--say about sixty or seventy miles. Instead of being wide apart--asAmerican appreciation of distances would naturally suggest--the placesmade most particularly celebrated by the presence of Christ are nearlyall right here in full view, and within cannon-shot of Capernaum.Leaving out two or three short journeys of the Saviour, he spent hislife, preached his gospel, and performed his miracles within a compass nolarger than an ordinary county in the United States. It is as much as Ican do to comprehend this stupefying fact. How it wears a man out tohave to read up a hundred pages of history every two or three miles--forverily the celebrated localities of Palestine occur that close together.How wearily, how bewilderingly they swarm about your path!
In due time we reached the ancient village of Magdala.
