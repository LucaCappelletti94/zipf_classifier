Let us be grateful to Adam our benefactor. He cut us out of the"blessing of idleness," and won for us the "curse of labor." --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

We soon reached the town of Nelson, and spent the most of the day there,visiting acquaintances and driving with them about the garden--the wholeregion is a garden, excepting the scene of the "Maungatapu Murders," ofthirty years ago.  That is a wild place--wild and lonely; an ideal placefor a murder.  It is at the base of a vast, rugged, densely timberedmountain.  In the deep twilight of that forest solitude four desperaterascals--Burgess, Sullivan, Levy, and Kelley--ambushed themselves besidethe mountain-trail to murder and rob four travelers--Kempthorne, Mathieu,Dudley, and De Pontius, the latter a New Yorker. A harmless old laboringman came wandering along, and as his presence was an embarrassment, theychoked him, hid him, and then resumed their watch for the four.  They hadto wait a while, but eventually everything turned out as they desired.
That dark episode is the one large event in the history of Nelson.  Thefame of it traveled far.  Burgess made a confession.  It is a remarkablepaper.  For brevity, succinctness, and concentration, it is perhapswithout its peer in the literature of murder.  There are no waste wordsin it; there is no obtrusion of matter not pertinent to the occasion, norany departure from the dispassionate tone proper to a formal businessstatement--for that is what it is: a business statement of a murder, bythe chief engineer of it, or superintendent, or foreman, or whatever onemay prefer to call him.
     "We were getting impatient, when we saw four men and a pack-horse     coming.  I left my cover and had a look at the men, for Levy had     told me that Mathieu was a small man and wore a large beard, and     that it was a chestnut horse.  I said, 'Here they come.'  They were     then a good distance away; I took the caps off my gun, and put fresh     ones on.  I said, 'You keep where you are, I'll put them up, and you     give me your gun while you tie them.'  It was arranged as I have     described.  The men came; they arrived within about fifteen yards     when I stepped up and said, 'Stand! bail up!'  That means all of     them to get together.  I made them fall back on the upper side of     the road with their faces up the range, and Sullivan brought me his     gun, and then tied their hands behind them.  The horse was very     quiet all the time, he did not move.  When they were all tied,     Sullivan took the horse up the hill, and put him in the bush; he cut     the rope and let the swags--[A "swag" is a kit, a pack, small     baggage.]--fall on the ground, and then came to me.  We then marched     the men down the incline to the creek; the water at this time barely     running.  Up this creek we took the men; we went, I daresay, five or     six hundred yards up it, which took us nearly half-an-hour to     accomplish.  Then we turned to the right up the range; we went, I     daresay, one hundred and fifty yards from the creek, and there we     sat down with the men.  I said to Sullivan, 'Put down your gun and     search these men,' which he did.  I asked them their several names;     they told me.  I asked them if they were expected at Nelson.  They     said, 'No.'  If such their lives would have been spared.  In money     we took L60 odd.  I said, 'Is this all you have?  You had better     tell me.' Sullivan said, 'Here is a bag of gold.' I said, 'What's on     that pack-horse?  Is there any gold?' when Kempthorne said, 'Yes,     my gold is in the portmanteau, and I trust you will not take it     all.' 'Well,' I said, 'we must take you away one at a time, because     the range is steep just here, and then we will let you go.' They     said, 'All right,' most cheerfully.  We tied their feet, and took     Dudley with us; we went about sixty yards with him.  This was     through a scrub.  It was arranged the night previously that it would     be best to choke them, in case the report of the arms might be heard     from the road, and if they were missed they never would be found.     So we tied a handkerchief over his eyes, when Sullivan took the sash     off his waist, put it round his neck, and so strangled him.     Sullivan, after I had killed the old laboring man, found fault with     the way he was choked.  He said, 'The next we do I'll show you my     way.'  I said, 'I have never done such a thing before.  I have shot     a man, but never choked one.'  We returned to the others, when     Kempthorne said, 'What noise was that?'  I said it was caused by     breaking through the scrub.  This was taking too much time, so it     was agreed to shoot them.  With that I said, 'We'll take you no     further, but separate you, and then loose one of you, and he can     relieve the others.'  So with that, Sullivan took De Pontius to the     left of where Kempthorne was sitting.  I took Mathieu to the right.     I tied a strap round his legs, and shot him with a revolver.  He     yelled, I ran from him with my gun in my hand, I sighted Kempthorne,     who had risen to his feet.  I presented the gun, and shot him behind     the right ear; his life's blood welled from him, and he died     instantaneously.  Sullivan had shot.  De Pontius in the meantime,     and then came to me.  I said, 'Look to Mathieu,' indicating the spot     where he lay.  He shortly returned and said, 'I had to "chiv" that     fellow, he was not dead,' a cant word, meaning that he had to stab     him.  Returning to the road we passed where De Pontius lay and was     dead.  Sullivan said, 'This is the digger, the others were all     storekeepers; this is the digger, let's cover him up, for should the     others be found, they'll think he done it and sloped,' meaning he     had gone.  So with that we threw all the stones on him, and then     left him.  This bloody work took nearly an hour and a half from the     time we stopped the men."
Anyone who reads that confession will think that the man who wrote it wasdestitute of emotions, destitute of feeling.  That is partly true.  Asregarded others he was plainly without feeling--utterly cold andpitiless; but as regarded himself the case was different.  While he carednothing for the future of the murdered men, he cared a great deal for hisown.  It makes one's flesh creep to read the introduction to hisconfession.  The judge on the bench characterized it as "scandalouslyblasphemous," and it certainly reads so, but Burgess meant no blasphemy.He was merely a brute, and whatever he said or wrote was sure to exposethe fact.  His redemption was a very real thing to him, and he was asjubilantly happy on the gallows as ever was Christian martyr at thestake.  We dwellers in this world are strangely made, and mysteriouslycircumstanced.  We have to suppose that the murdered men are lost, andthat Burgess is saved; but we cannot suppress our natural regrets.
     "Written in my dungeon drear this 7th of August, in the year of     Grace, 1866.  To God be ascribed all power and glory in subduing the     rebellious spirit of a most guilty wretch, who has been brought,     through the instrumentality of a faithful follower of Christ, to see     his wretched and guilty state, inasmuch as hitherto he has led an     awful and wretched life, and through the assurance of this faithful     soldier of Christ, he has been led and also believes that Christ     will yet receive and cleanse him from all his deep-dyed and bloody     sins.  I lie under the imputation which says, 'Come now and let us     reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet,     they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson,     they shall be as wool.' On this promise I rely."
We sailed in the afternoon late, spent a few hours at New Plymouth, thensailed again and reached Auckland the next day, November 20th, andremained in that fine city several days.  Its situation is commanding,and the sea-view is superb.  There are charming drives all about, and bycourtesy of friends we had opportunity to enjoy them.  From the grassycrater-summit of Mount Eden one's eye ranges over a grand sweep andvariety of scenery--forests clothed in luxuriant foliage, rolling greenfields, conflagrations of flowers, receding and dimming stretches ofgreen plain, broken by lofty and symmetrical old craters--then the bluebays twinkling and sparkling away into the dreamy distances where themountains loom spiritual in their veils of haze.
It is from Auckland that one goes to Rotorua, the region of the renownedhot lakes and geysers--one of the chief wonders of New Zealand; but I wasnot well enough to make the trip.  The government has a sanitorium there,and everything is comfortable for the tourist and the invalid.  Thegovernment's official physician is almost over-cautious in his estimatesof the efficacy of the baths, when he is talking about rheumatism, gout,paralysis, and such things; but when he is talking about theeffectiveness of the waters in eradicating the whisky-habit, he seems tohave no reserves.  The baths will cure the drinking-habit no matter howchronic it is--and cure it so effectually that even the desire to drinkintoxicants will come no more.  There should be a rush from Europe andAmerica to that place; and when the victims of alcoholism find out whatthey can get by going there, the rush will begin.
The Thermal-springs District of New Zealand comprises an area of upwardsof 600,000 acres, or close on 1,000 square miles.  Rotorua is thefavorite place.  It is the center of a rich field of lake and mountainscenery; from Rotorua as a base the pleasure-seeker makes excursions.The crowd of sick people is great, and growing.  Rotorua is the Carlsbadof Australasia.
It is from Auckland that the Kauri gum is shipped.  For a long time nowabout 8,000 tons of it have been brought into the town per year.  It isworth about $300 per ton, unassorted; assorted, the finest grades areworth about $1,000.  It goes to America, chiefly.  It is in lumps, and ishard and smooth, and looks like amber--the light-colored like new amber,and the dark brown like rich old amber.  And it has the pleasant feel ofamber, too.  Some of the light-colored samples were a tolerably faircounterfeit of uncut South African diamonds, they were so perfectlysmooth and polished and transparent.  It is manufactured into varnish; avarnish which answers for copal varnish and is cheaper.
The gum is dug up out of the ground; it has been there for ages.  It isthe sap of the Kauri tree.  Dr. Campbell of Auckland told me he sent acargo of it to England fifty years ago, but nothing came of the venture.Nobody knew what to do with it; so it was sold at 15 a ton, to lightfires with.
November 26--3 P.M., sailed.  Vast and beautiful harbor.  Land all aboutfor hours.  Tangariwa, the mountain that "has the same shape from everypoint of view."  That is the common belief in Auckland.  And so it has--from every point of view except thirteen.  Perfect summer weather.  Largeschool of whales in the distance.  Nothing could be daintier than thepuffs of vapor they spout up, when seen against the pink glory of thesinking sun, or against the dark mass of an island reposing in the deepblue shadow of a storm cloud .  .  .  .  Great Barrier rock standing upout of the sea away to the left.  Sometime ago a ship hit it full speedin a fog--20 miles out of her course--140 lives lost; the captaincommitted suicide without waiting a moment.  He knew that, whether he wasto blame or not, the company owning the vessel would discharge him andmake a devotion--to--passengers' safety advertisement out of it, and hischance to make a livelihood would be permanently gone.
