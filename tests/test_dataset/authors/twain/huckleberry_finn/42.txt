"Did I give you the letter?"
"What letter?"
"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office."
"No, you didn't give me no letter."
"Well, I must a forgot it."
So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off some-wheres where he had laid it down, and fetched it, andgive it to her. She says:
"Why, it's from St. Petersburg -- it's from Sis."
I allowed another walk would do me good; but Icouldn't stir. But before she could break it open shedropped it and run -- for she see something. And sodid I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that olddoctor; and Jim, in HER calico dress, with his handstied behind him; and a lot of people. I hid the letterbehind the first thing that come handy, and rushed.She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:
"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"
And Tom he turned his head a little, and mutteredsomething or other, which showed he warn't in hisright mind; then she flung up her hands, and says:
"He's alive, thank God! And that's enough!"and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the houseto get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and leftat the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tonguecould go, every jump of the way.
I followed the men to see what they was going to dowith Jim; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followedafter Tom into the house. The men was very huffy,and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an exampleto all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn'tbe trying to run away like Jim done, and making sucha raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scaredmost to death for days and nights. But the others said,don't do it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't ournigger, and his owner would turn up and make us payfor him, sure. So that cooled them down a little, be-cause the people that's always the most anxious for tohang a nigger that hain't done just right is always thevery ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for himwhen they've got their satisfaction out of him.
They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give hima cuff or two side the head once in a while, but Jimnever said nothing, and he never let on to know me,and they took him to the same cabin, and put his ownclothes on him, and chained him again, and not to nobed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bot-tom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, andsaid he warn't to have nothing but bread and water toeat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auc-tion because he didn't come in a certain length of time,and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmerswith guns must stand watch around about the cabinevery night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the day-time; and about this time they was through with thejob and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-byecussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes alook, and says:
"Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleegedto, because he ain't a bad nigger. When I got towhere I found the boy I see I couldn't cut the bulletout without some help, and he warn't in no conditionfor me to leave to go and get help; and he got a littleworse and a little worse, and after a long time he wentout of his head, and wouldn't let me come a-nigh himany more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me,and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see Icouldn't do anything at all with him; so I says, I gotto have HELP somehow; and the minute I says it outcrawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help,and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of courseI judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I WAS!and there I had to stick right straight along all the restof the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! Ihad a couple of patients with the chills, and of courseI'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but Idasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'dbe to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enoughfor me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb untildaylight this morning; and I never see a nigger thatwas a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was riskinghis freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and Isee plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately.I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, anigger like that is worth a thousand dollars -- and kindtreatment, too. I had everything I needed, and theboy was doing as well there as he would a done athome -- better, maybe, because it was so quiet; butthere I WAS, with both of 'm on my hands, and thereI had to stick till about dawn this morning; then somemen in a skiff come by, and as good luck would haveit the nigger was setting by the pallet with his headpropped on his knees sound asleep; so I motionedthem in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbedhim and tied him before he knowed what he wasabout, and we never had no trouble. And the boybeing in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled theoars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over verynice and quiet, and the nigger never made the leastrow nor said a word from the start. He ain't no badnigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about him."
Somebody says:
"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged tosay."
Then the others softened up a little, too, and I wasmighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim thatgood turn; and I was glad it was according to my judg-ment of him, too; because I thought he had a goodheart in him and was a good man the first time I seehim. Then they all agreed that Jim had acted verywell, and was deserving to have some notice took ofit, and reward. So every one of them promised, rightout and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.
Then they come out and locked him up. I hopedthey was going to say he could have one or two of thechains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or couldhave meat and greens with his bread and water; butthey didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't bestfor me to mix in, but I judged I'd get the doctor's yarnto Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I'd gotthrough the breakers that was laying just ahead of me --explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention aboutSid being shot when I was telling how him and me putin that dratted night paddling around hunting the run-away nigger.
But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to thesick-room all day and all night, and every time I seeUncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.
Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better,and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. SoI slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake Ireckoned we could put up a yarn for the family thatwould wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping verypeaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he waswhen he come. So I set down and laid for him towake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes glidingin, and there I was, up a stump again! She motionedme to be still, and set down by me, and begun towhisper, and said we could all be joyful now, becauseall the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleepinglike that for ever so long, and looking better and peace-fuller all the time, and ten to one he'd wake up in hisright mind.
So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs abit, and opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look,and says:
"Hello! -- why, I'm at HOME! How's that?Where's the raft?"
"It's all right," I says.
"And JIM?"
"The same," I says, but couldn't say it prettybrash. But he never noticed, but says:
"Good! Splendid! NOW we're all right and safe!Did you tell Aunty?"
I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:"About what, Sid?"
"Why, about the way the whole thing was done."
"What whole thing?"
"Why, THE whole thing. There ain't but one; howwe set the runaway nigger free -- me and Tom."
"Good land! Set the run -- What IS the childtalking about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!"
"NO, I ain't out of my HEAD; I know all what I'mtalking about. We DID set him free -- me and Tom.We laid out to do it, and we DONE it. And we doneit elegant, too." He'd got a start, and she neverchecked him up, just set and stared and stared, and lethim clip along, and I see it warn't no use for ME to putin. "Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work --weeks of it -- hours and hours, every night, whilst youwas all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and thesheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, andtin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, andthe grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, andyou can't think what work it was to make the saws, andpens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, andyou can't think HALF the fun it was. And we had tomake up the pictures of coffins and things, and non-namous letters from the robbers, and get up and downthe lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, andmade the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie,and send in spoons and things to work with in yourapron pocket --"
"Mercy sakes!"
"-- and load up the cabin with rats and snakes andso on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tomhere so long with the butter in his hat that you comenear spiling the whole business, because the men comebefore we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush,and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got myshare, and we dodged out of the path and let them goby, and when the dogs come they warn't interested inus, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe,and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim wasa free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and WASN'Tit bully, Aunty!"
"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my borndays! So it was YOU, you little rapscallions, that's beenmaking all this trouble, and turned everybody's witsclean inside out and scared us all most to death. I've asgood a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o'you this very minute. To think, here I've been, nightafter night, a -- YOU just get well once, you youngscamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out o' both o'ye!"
But Tom, he WAS so proud and joyful, he just COULDN'Thold in, and his tongue just WENT it -- she a-chippingin, and spitting fire all along, and both of them goingit at once, like a cat convention; and she says:
"WELL, you get all the enjoyment you can out of itNOW, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling withhim again --"
"Meddling with WHO?" Tom says, dropping hissmile and looking surprised.
"With WHO? Why, the runaway nigger, of course.Who'd you reckon?"
Tom looks at me very grave, and says:
"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right?Hasn't he got away?"
"HIM?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger?'Deed he hasn't. They've got him back, safe andsound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread andwater, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimedor sold!"
Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, andhis nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and singsout to me:
"They hain't no RIGHT to shut him up! SHOVE! --and don't you lose a minute. Turn him loose! heain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur that walksthis earth!"
"What DOES the child mean?"
"I mean every word I SAY, Aunt Sally, and if some-body don't go, I'LL go. I've knowed him all his life,and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died twomonths ago, and she was ashamed she ever was goingto sell him down the river, and SAID so; and she sethim free in her will."
"Then what on earth did YOU want to set him freefor, seeing he was already free?"
"Well, that IS a question, I must say; and just likewomen! Why, I wanted the ADVENTURE of it; and I'da waded neck-deep in blood to -- goodness alive, AUNTPOLLY!"
If she warn't standing right there, just inside thedoor, looking as sweet and contented as an angel halffull of pie, I wish I may never!
Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged thehead off of her, and cried over her, and I found agood enough place for me under the bed, for it wasgetting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And Ipeeped out, and in a little while Tom's Aunt Pollyshook herself loose and stood there looking across atTom over her spectacles -- kind of grinding him intothe earth, you know. And then she says:
"Yes, you BETTER turn y'r head away -- I would if Iwas you, Tom."
"Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "IS he changedso? Why, that ain't TOM, it's Sid; Tom's -- Tom's-- why, where is Tom? He was here a minute ago."
"You mean where's Huck FINN -- that's what youmean! I reckon I hain't raised such a scamp as myTom all these years not to know him when I SEE him.That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do. Come out fromunder that bed, Huck Finn."
So I done it. But not feeling brash.
Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-lookingpersons I ever see -- except one, and that was UncleSilas, when he come in and they told it all to him. Itkind of made him drunk, as you may say, and hedidn't know nothing at all the rest of the day, andpreached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gavehim a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man inthe world couldn't a understood it. So Tom's AuntPolly, she told all about who I was, and what; and Ihad to up and tell how I was in such a tight place thatwhen Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer -- shechipped in and says, "Oh, go on and call me AuntSally, I'm used to it now, and 'tain't no need tochange" -- that when Aunt Sally took me for TomSawyer I had to stand it -- there warn't no other way,and I knowed he wouldn't mind, because it would benuts for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an ad-venture out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And soit turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made thingsas soft as he could for me.
And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right aboutold Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so,sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all thattrouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and Icouldn't ever understand before, until that minute andthat talk, how he COULD help a body set a nigger freewith his bringing-up.
Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sallywrote to her that Tom and SID had come all right andsafe, she says to herself:
"Look at that, now! I might have expected it,letting him go off that way without anybody to watchhim. So now I got to go and trapse all the way downthe river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what thatcreetur's up to THIS time, as long as I couldn't seem toget any answer out of you about it."
"Why, I never heard nothing from you," saysAunt Sally.
"Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to askyou what you could mean by Sid being here."
"Well, I never got 'em, Sis."
Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, andsays:
"You, Tom!"
"Well -- WHAT?" he says, kind of pettish.
"Don t you what ME, you impudent thing -- handout them letters."
"What letters?"
"THEM letters. I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll --"
"They're in the trunk. There, now. And they'rejust the same as they was when I got them out of theoffice. I hain't looked into them, I hain't touchedthem. But I knowed they'd make trouble, and Ithought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd --"
"Well, you DO need skinning, there ain't no mistakeabout it. And I wrote another one to tell you I wascoming; and I s'pose he --"
"No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, butIT'S all right, I've got that one."
I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but Ireckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to. So Inever said nothing.
