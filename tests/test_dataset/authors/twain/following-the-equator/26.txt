There are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one! keepfrom telling their happinesses to the unhappy. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
After visits to Maryborough and some other Australian towns, we presentlytook passage for New Zealand. If it would not look too much like showingoff, I would tell the reader where New Zealand is; for he is as I was; hethinks he knows. And he thinks he knows where Hertzegovina is; and howto pronounce pariah; and how to use the word unique without exposinghimself to the derision of the dictionary. But in truth, he knows noneof these things. There are but four or five people in the world whopossess this knowledge, and these make their living out of it. Theytravel from place to place, visiting literary assemblages, geographicalsocieties, and seats of learning, and springing sudden bets that thesepeople do not know these things. Since all people think they know them,they are an easy prey to these adventurers. Or rather they were an easyprey until the law interfered, three months ago, and a New York courtdecided that this kind of gambling is illegal, "because it traversesArticle IV, Section 9, of the Constitution of the United States, whichforbids betting on a sure thing." This decision was rendered by the fullBench of the New York Supreme Court, after a test sprung upon the courtby counsel for the prosecution, which showed that none of the nine Judgeswas able to answer any of the four questions.
All people think that New Zealand is close to Australia or Asia, orsomewhere, and that you cross to it on a bridge. But that is not so. Itis not close to anything, but lies by itself, out in the water. It isnearest to Australia, but still not near. The gap between is very wide.It will be a surprise to the reader, as it was to me, to learn that thedistance from Australia to New Zealand is really twelve or thirteenhundred miles, and that there is no bridge. I learned this fromProfessor X., of Yale University, whom I met in the steamer on the greatlakes when I was crossing the continent to sail across the Pacific. Iasked him about New Zealand, in order to make conversation. I supposedhe would generalize a little without compromising himself, and then turnthe subject to something he was acquainted with, and my object would thenbe attained; the ice would be broken, and we could go smoothly on, andget acquainted, and have a pleasant time. But, to my surprise, he wasnot only not embarrassed by my question, but seemed to welcome it, and totake a distinct interest in it. He began to talk--fluently, confidently,comfortably; and as he talked, my admiration grew and grew; for as thesubject developed under his hands, I saw that he not only knew where NewZealand was, but that he was minutely familiar with every detail of itshistory, politics, religions, and commerce, its fauna, flora, geology,products, and climatic peculiarities. When he was done, I was lost inwonder and admiration, and said to myself, he knows everything; in thedomain of human knowledge he is king.
I wanted to see him do more miracles; and so, just for the pleasure ofhearing him answer, I asked him about Hertzegovina, and pariah, andunique. But he began to generalize then, and show distress. I saw thatwith New Zealand gone, he was a Samson shorn of his locks; he was asother men. This was a curious and interesting mystery, and I was frankwith him, and asked him to explain it.
He tried to avoid it at first; but then laughed and said that after all,the matter was not worth concealment, so he would let me into the secret.In substance, this is his story:
"Last autumn I was at work one morning at home, when a card came up--thecard of a stranger. Under the name was printed a line which showed thatthis visitor was Professor of Theological Engineering in WellingtonUniversity, New Zealand. I was troubled--troubled, I mean, by theshortness of the notice. College etiquette required that he be at onceinvited to dinner by some member of the Faculty--invited to dine on thatday--not, put off till a subsequent day. I did not quite know what todo. College etiquette requires, in the case of a foreign guest, that thedinner-talk shall begin with complimentary references to his country, itsgreat men, its services to civilization, its seats of learning, andthings like that; and of course the host is responsible, and must eitherbegin this talk himself or see that it is done by some one else. I wasin great difficulty; and the more I searched my memory, the more mytrouble grew. I found that I knew nothing about New Zealand. I thoughtI knew where it was, and that was all. I had an impression that it wasclose to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and that one went over to iton a bridge. This might turn out to be incorrect; and even if correct,it would not furnish matter enough for the purpose at the dinner, and Ishould expose my College to shame before my guest; he would see that I, amember of the Faculty of the first University in America, was whollyignorant of his country, and he would go away and tell this, and laugh atit. The thought of it made my face burn.
"I sent for my wife and told her how I was situated, and asked for herhelp, and she thought of a thing which I might have thought of myself, ifI had not been excited and worried. She said she would go and tell thevisitor that I was out but would be in in a few minutes; and she wouldtalk, and keep him busy while I got out the back way and hurried over andmake Professor Lawson give the dinner. For Lawson knew everything, andcould meet the guest in a creditable way and save the reputation of theUniversity. I ran to Lawson, but was disappointed. He did not knowanything about New Zealand. He said that, as far as his recollectionwent it was close to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and you go over toit on a bridge; but that was all he knew. It was too bad. Lawson was aperfect encyclopedia of abstruse learning; but now in this hour of ourneed, it turned out that he did not know any useful thing.
"We consulted. He saw that the reputation of the University was in veryreal peril, and he walked the floor in anxiety, talking, and trying tothink out some way to meet the difficulty. Presently he decided that wemust try the rest of the Faculty--some of them might know about NewZealand. So we went to the telephone and called up the professor ofastronomy and asked him, and he said that all he knew was, that it wasclose to Australia, or Asia, or somewhere, and you went over to it on----
"We shut him off and called up the professor of biology, and he said thatall he knew was that it was close to Aus----.
"We shut him off, and sat down, worried and disheartened, to see if wecould think up some other scheme. We shortly hit upon one which promisedwell, and this one we adopted, and set its machinery going at once. Itwas this. Lawson must give the dinner. The Faculty must be notified bytelephone to prepare. We must all get to work diligently, and at the endof eight hours and a half we must come to dinner acquainted with NewZealand; at least well enough informed to appear without discredit beforethis native. To seem properly intelligent we should have to know aboutNew Zealand's population, and politics, and form of government, andcommerce, and taxes, and products, and ancient history, and modernhistory, and varieties of religion, and nature of the laws, and theircodification, and amount of revenue, and whence drawn, and methods ofcollection, and percentage of loss, and character of climate, and--well,a lot of things like that; we must suck the maps and cyclopedias dry.And while we posted up in this way, the Faculty's wives must flock over,one after the other, in a studiedly casual way, and help my wife keep theNew Zealander quiet, and not let him get out and come interfering withour studies. The scheme worked admirably; but it stopped business,stopped it entirely.
"It is in the official log-book of Yale, to be read and wondered at byfuture generations--the account of the Great Blank Day--the memorableBlank Day--the day wherein the wheels of culture were stopped, a Sundaysilence prevailed all about, and the whole University stood still whilethe Faculty read-up and qualified itself to sit at meat, without shame,in the presence of the Professor of Theological Engineering from NewZealand:
"When we assembled at the dinner we were miserably tired and worn--but wewere posted. Yes, it is fair to claim that. In fact, erudition is apale name for it. New Zealand was the only subject; and it was justbeautiful to hear us ripple it out. And with such an air ofunembarrassed ease, and unostentatious familiarity with detail, andtrained and seasoned mastery of the subject-and oh, the grace and fluencyof it!
"Well, finally somebody happened to notice that the guest was lookingdazed, and wasn't saying anything. So they stirred him up, of course.Then that man came out with a good, honest, eloquent compliment that madethe Faculty blush. He said he was not worthy to sit in the company ofmen like these; that he had been silent from admiration; that he had beensilent from another cause also--silent from shame--silent from ignorance!'For,' said he, 'I, who have lived eighteen years in New Zealand and haveserved five in a professorship, and ought to know much about thatcountry, perceive, now, that I know almost nothing about it. I say itwith shame, that I have learned fifty times, yes, a hundred times moreabout New Zealand in these two hours at this table than I ever knewbefore in all the eighteen years put together. I was silent because Icould not help myself. What I knew about taxes, and policies, and laws,and revenue, and products, and history, and all that multitude of things,was but general, and ordinary, and vague-unscientific, in a word--and itwould have been insanity to expose it here to the searching glare of youramazingly accurate and all-comprehensive knowledge of those matters,gentlemen. I beg you to let me sit silent--as becomes me. But do notchange the subject; I can at least follow you, in this one; whereas ifyou change to one which shall call out the full strength of your mightyerudition, I shall be as one lost. If you know all this about a remotelittle inconsequent patch like New Zealand, ah, what wouldn't you knowabout any other Subject!'"
