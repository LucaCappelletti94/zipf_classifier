CONJECTURES
The historians "suppose" that Shakespeare attended the Free Schoolin Stratford from the time he was seven years old till he wasthirteen. There is no EVIDENCE in existence that he ever went toschool at all.
The historians "infer" that he got his Latin in that school--theschool which they "suppose" he attended.
They "suppose" his father's declining fortunes made it necessaryfor him to leave the school they supposed he attended, and get towork and help support his parents and their ten children. Butthere is no evidence that he ever entered or retired from theschool they suppose he attended.
They "suppose" he assisted his father in the butchering business;and that, being only a boy, he didn't have to do full-grownbutchering, but only slaughtered calves. Also, that whenever hekilled a calf he made a high-flown speech over it. Thissupposition rests upon the testimony of a man who wasn't there atthe time; a man who got it from a man who could have been there,but did not say whether he was or not; and neither of them thoughtto mention it for decades, and decades, and decades, and two moredecades after Shakespeare's death (until old age and mental decayhad refreshed and vivified their memories). They hadn't two factsin stock about the long-dead distinguished citizen, but only justthe one: he slaughtered calves and broke into oratory while he wasat it. Curious. They had only one fact, yet the distinguishedcitizen had spent twenty-six years in that little town--just halfhis lifetime. However, rightly viewed, it was the most importantfact, indeed almost the only important fact, of Shakespeare's lifein Stratford. Rightly viewed. For experience is an author's mostvaluable asset; experience is the thing that puts the muscle andthe breath and the warm blood into the book he writes. Rightlyviewed, calf-butchering accounts for Titus Andronicus, the onlyplay--ain't it?--that the Stratford Shakespeare ever wrote; and yetit is the only one everybody tries to chouse him out of, theBaconians included.
The historians find themselves "justified in believing" that theyoung Shakespeare poached upon Sir Thomas Lucy's deer preserves andgot haled before that magistrate for it. But there is no shred ofrespectworthy evidence that anything of the kind happened.
The historians, having argued the thing that MIGHT have happenedinto the thing that DID happen, found no trouble in turning SirThomas Lucy into Mr. Justice Shallow. They have long ago convincedthe world--on surmise and without trustworthy evidence--thatShallow IS Sir Thomas.
The next addition to the young Shakespeare's Stratford historycomes easy. The historian builds it out of the surmised deer-stealing, and the surmised trial before the magistrate, and thesurmised vengeance-prompted satire upon the magistrate in the play:result, the young Shakespeare was a wild, wild, wild, oh SUCH awild young scamp, and that gratuitous slander is established forall time! It is the very way Professor Osborn and I built thecolossal skeleton brontosaur that stands fifty-seven feet long andsixteen feet high in the Natural History Museum, the awe andadmiration of all the world, the stateliest skeleton that exists onthe planet. We had nine bones, and we built the rest of him out ofplaster of paris. We ran short of plaster of paris, or we'd havebuilt a brontosaur that could sit down beside the StratfordShakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was biggest orcontained the most plaster.
Shakespeare pronounced Venus and Adonis "the first heir of hisinvention," apparently implying that it was his first effort atliterary composition. He should not have said it. It has been anembarrassment to his historians these many, many years. They haveto make him write that graceful and polished and flawless andbeautiful poem before he escaped from Stratford and his family--1586 or '87--age, twenty-two, or along there; because within thenext five years he wrote five great plays, and could not have foundtime to write another line.
It is sorely embarrassing. If he began to slaughter calves, andpoach deer, and rollick around, and learn English, at the earliestlikely moment--say at thirteen, when he was supposably wrenchedfrom that school where he was supposably storing up Latin forfuture literary use--he had his youthful hands full, and much morethan full. He must have had to put aside his Warwickshire dialect,which wouldn't be understood in London, and study English veryhard. Very hard indeed; incredibly hard, almost, if the result ofthat labor was to be the smooth and rounded and flexible andletter-perfect English of the Venus and Adonis in the space of tenyears; and at the same time learn great and fine and unsurpassableliterary form.
However, it is "conjectured" that he accomplished all this andmore, much more: learned law and its intricacies; and the complexprocedure of the law courts; and all about soldiering, andsailoring, and the manners and customs and ways of royal courts andaristocratic society; and likewise accumulated in his one headevery kind of knowledge the learned then possessed, and every kindof humble knowledge possessed by the lowly and the ignorant; andadded thereto a wider and more intimate knowledge of the world'sgreat literatures, ancient and modern, than was possessed by anyother man of his time--for he was going to make brilliant and easyand admiration-compelling use of these splendid treasures themoment he got to London. And according to the surmisers, that iswhat he did. Yes, although there was no one in Stratford able toteach him these things, and no library in the little village to digthem out of. His father could not read, and even the surmiserssurmise that he did not keep a library.
It is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare gothis vast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurateacquaintance with the manners and customs and shop-talk of lawyersthrough being for a time the CLERK OF A STRATFORD COURT; just as abright lad like me, reared in a village on the banks of theMississippi, might become perfect in knowledge of the BehringStrait whale-fishery and the shop-talk of the veteran exercisers ofthat adventure-bristling trade through catching catfish with a"trot-line" Sundays. But the surmise is damaged by the fact thatthere is no evidence--and not even tradition--that the youngShakespeare was ever clerk of a law court.
It is further surmised that the young Shakespeare accumulated hislaw-treasures in the first years of his sojourn in London, through"amusing himself" by learning book-law in his garret and by pickingup lawyer-talk and the rest of it through loitering about the law-courts and listening. But it is only surmise; there is no EVIDENCEthat he ever did either of those things. They are merely a coupleof chunks of plaster of paris.
There is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holdinghorses in front of the London theatres, mornings and afternoons.Maybe he did. If he did, it seriously shortened his law-studyhours and his recreation-time in the courts. In those very days hewas writing great plays, and needed all the time he could get. Thehorse-holding legend ought to be strangled; it too formidablyincreases the historian's difficulty in accounting for the youngShakespeare's erudition--an erudition which he was acquiring, hunkby hunk and chunk by chunk every day in those strenuous times, andemptying each day's catch into next day's imperishable drama.
He had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time; and aknowledge of soldier-people and sailor-people and their ways andtalk; also a knowledge of some foreign lands and their languages:for he was daily emptying fluent streams of these variousknowledges, too, into his dramas. How did he acquire these richassets?
In the usual way: by surmise. It is SURMISED that he travelled inItaly and Germany and around, and qualified himself to put theirscenic and social aspects upon paper; that he perfected himself inFrench, Italian and Spanish on the road; that he went inLeicester's expedition to the Low Countries, as soldier or sutleror something, for several months or years--or whatever length oftime a surmiser needs in his business--and thus became familiarwith soldiership and soldier-ways and soldier-talk, and generalshipand general-ways and general-talk, and seamanship and sailor-waysand sailor-talk.
Maybe he did all these things, but I would like to know who heldthe horses in the meantime; and who studied the books in thegarret; and who frollicked in the law-courts for recreation. Also,who did the call-boying and the play-acting.
For he became a call-boy; and as early as '93 he became a"vagabond"--the law's ungentle term for an unlisted actor; and in'94 a "regular" and properly and officially listed member of that(in those days) lightly-valued and not much respected profession.
Right soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theatres, andmanager of them. Thenceforward he was a busy and flourishingbusiness man, and was raking in money with both hands for twentyyears. Then in a noble frenzy of poetic inspiration he wrote hisone poem--his only poem, his darling--and laid him down and died:
Good friend for Iesus sake forbeareTo digg the dust encloased heare:Blest be ye man yt spares thes stonesAnd curst be he yt moves my bones.
He was probably dead when he wrote it. Still, this is onlyconjecture. We have only circumstantial evidence. Internalevidence.
Shall I set down the rest of the Conjectures which constitute thegiant Biography of William Shakespeare? It would strain theUnabridged Dictionary to hold them. He is a Brontosaur: ninebones and six hundred barrels of plaster of paris.
