  I wonder, can the night go by;	Can this shot arrow of travel fly	Shaft-golden with light, sheer into the sky	 Of a dawned to-morrow,	Without ever sleep delivering us From each other, or loosing the dolorous	 Unfruitful sorrow!	 What is it then that you can see	That at the window endlessly	You watch the red sparks whirl and flee  And the night look through?	Your presence peering lonelily there	Oppresses me so, I can hardly bear	 To share the train with you.	 You hurt my heart-beats' privacy; I wish I could put you away from me;	I suffocate in this intimacy,	 For all that I love you;	How I have longed for this night in the train,	Yet now every fibre of me cries in pain  To God to remove you.	 But surely my soul's best dream is still	That one night pouring down shall swill	Us away in an utter sleep, until	 We are one, smooth-rounded. Yet closely bitten in to me	Is this armour of stiff reluctancy	 That keeps me impounded.	 So, dear love, when another night	Pours on us, lift your fingers white And strip me naked, touch me light,	 Light, light all over.	For I ache most earnestly for your touch,	Yet I cannot move, however much	 I would be your lover.  Night after night with a blemish of day	Unblown and unblossomed has withered away;	Come another night, come a new night, say	 Will you pluck me apart?	Will you open the amorous, aching bud Of my body, and loose the burning flood	 That would leap to you from my heart?
