  Patience, little Heart.	One day a heavy, June-hot woman	Will enter and shut the door to stay.	 And when your stifling heart would summon	Cool, lonely night, her roused breasts will keep the night at bay, Sitting in your room like two tiger-lilies	Flaming on after sunset,	Destroying the cool, lonely night with the glow of their hot twilight;	There in the morning, still, while the fierce strange scent comes yet	Stronger, hot and red; till you thirst for the daffodillies With an anguished, husky thirst that you cannot assuage,	When the daffodillies are dead, and a woman of the dog-days holds you in gage.	Patience, little Heart.
