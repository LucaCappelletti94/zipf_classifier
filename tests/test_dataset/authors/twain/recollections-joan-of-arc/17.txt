She Is Made General-in-Chief
IT WAS indeed a great day, and a stirring thing to see.
She had won! It was a mistake of Tremouille and her other ill-wishers tolet her hold court those nights.
The commission of priests sent to Lorraine ostensibly to inquire intoJoan's character--in fact to weary her with delays and wear out herpurpose and make her give it up--arrived back and reported her characterperfect. Our affairs were in full career now, you see.
The verdict made a prodigious stir. Dead France woke suddenly to life,wherever the great news traveled. Whereas before, the spiritless andcowed people hung their heads and slunk away if one mentioned war tothem, now they came clamoring to be enlisted under the banner of the Maidof Vaucouleurs, and the roaring of war-songs and the thundering of thedrums filled all the air. I remembered now what she had said, that timethere in our village when I proved by facts and statistics that France'scase was hopeless, and nothing could ever rouse the people from theirlethargy:
"They will hear the drums--and they will answer, they will march!"
It has been said that misfortunes never come one at a time, but in abody. In our case it was the same with good luck. Having got a start, itcame flooding in, tide after tide. Our next wave of it was of this sort.There had been grave doubts among the priests as to whether the Churchought to permit a female soldier to dress like a man. But now came averdict on that head. Two of the greatest scholars and theologians of thetime--one of whom had been Chancellor of the University ofParis--rendered it. They decided that since Joan "must do the work of aman and a soldier, it is just and legitimate that her apparel shouldconform to the situation."
It was a great point gained, the Church's authority to dress as a man.Oh, yes, wave on wave the good luck came sweeping in. Never mind aboutthe smaller waves, let us come to the largest one of all, the wave thatswept us small fry quite off our feet and almost drowned us with joy. Theday of the great verdict, couriers had been despatched to the King withit, and the next morning bright and early the clear notes of a bugle camefloating to us on the crisp air, and we pricked up our ears and began tocount them. One--two--three; pause; one--two; pause; one--two--three,again--and out we skipped and went flying; for that formula was used onlywhen the King's herald-at-arms would deliver a proclamation to thepeople. As we hurried along, people came racing out of every street andhouse and alley, men, women, and children, all flushed, excited, andthrowing lacking articles of clothing on as they ran; still those clearnotes pealed out, and still the rush of people increased till the wholetown was abroad and streaming along the principal street. At last wereached the square, which was now packed with citizens, and there, highon the pedestal of the great cross, we saw the herald in his brilliantcostume, with his servitors about him. The next moment he began hisdelivery in the powerful voice proper to his office:
"Know all men, and take heed therefore, that the most high, the mostillustrious Charles, by the grace of God King of France, hath beenpleased to confer upon his well-beloved servant Joan of Arc, called theMaid, the title, emoluments, authorities, and dignity of General-in-Chiefof the Armies of France--"
Here a thousand caps flew in the air, and the multitude burst into ahurricane of cheers that raged and raged till it seemed as if it wouldnever come to an end; but at last it did; then the herald went on andfinished:
--"and hath appointed to be her lieutenant and chief of staff a prince ofhis royal house, his grace the Duke of Alencon!"
That was the end, and the hurricane began again, and was split up intoinnumerable strips by the blowers of it and wafted through all the lanesand streets of the town.
General of the Armies of France, with a prince of the blood forsubordinate! Yesterday she was nothing--to-day she was this. Yesterdayshe was not even a sergeant, not even a corporal, not even aprivate--to-day, with one step, she was at the top. Yesterday she wasless than nobody to the newest recruit--to-day her command was law to LaHire, Saintrailles, the Bastard of Orleans, and all those others,veterans of old renown, illustrious masters of the trade of war. Thesewere the thoughts I was thinking; I was trying to realize this strangeand wonderful thing that had happened, you see.
My mind went travelling back, and presently lighted upon a picture--apicture which was still so new and fresh in my memory that it seemed amatter of only yesterday--and indeed its date was no further back thanthe first days of January. This is what it was. A peasant-girl in afar-off village, her seventeenth year not yet quite completed, andherself and her village as unknown as if they had been on the other sideof the globe. She had picked up a friendless wanderer somewhere andbrought it home--a small gray kitten in a forlorn and starvingcondition--and had fed it and comforted it and got its confidence andmade it believe in her, and now it was curled up in her lap asleep, andshe was knitting a coarse stocking and thinking--dreaming--about what,one may never know. And now--the kitten had hardly had time to become acat, and yet already the girl is General of the Armies of France, with aprince of the blood to give orders to, and out of her village obscurityher name has climbed up like the sun and is visible from all corners ofthe land! It made me dizzy to think of these things, they were so out ofthe common order, and seemed so impossible.
