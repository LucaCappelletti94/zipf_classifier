"We May Assume"
In the Assuming trade three separate and independent cults aretransacting business. Two of these cults are known as theShakespearites and the Baconians, and I am the other one--theBrontosaurian.
The Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare's Works;the Baconian knows that Francis Bacon wrote them; the Brontosauriandoesn't really know which of them did it, but is quite composedlyand contentedly sure that Shakespeare DIDN'T, and strongly suspectsthat Bacon DID. We all have to do a good deal of assuming, but Iam fairly certain that in every case I can call to mind theBaconian assumers have come out ahead of the Shakespearites. Bothparties handle the same materials, but the Baconians seem to me toget much more reasonable and rational and persuasive results out ofthem than is the case with the Shakespearites. The Shakespeariteconducts his assuming upon a definite principle, an unchanging andimmutable law--which is: 2 and 8 and 7 and 14, added together,make 165. I believe this to be an error. No matter, you cannotget a habit-sodden Shakespearite to cipher-up his materials uponany other basis. With the Baconian it is different. If you placebefore him the above figures and set him to adding them up, he willnever in any case get more than 45 out of them, and in nine casesout of ten he will get just the proper 31.
Let me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and homely waycalculated to bring the idea within the grasp of the ignorant andunintelligent. We will suppose a case: take a lap-bred, house-fed, uneducated, inexperienced kitten; take a rugged old Tom that'sscarred from stem to rudder-post with the memorials of strenuousexperience, and is so cultured, so educated, so limitlessly eruditethat one may say of him "all cat-knowledge is his province"; also,take a mouse. Lock the three up in a holeless, crackless, exitlessprison-cell. Wait half an hour, then open the cell, introduce aShakespearite and a Baconian, and let them cipher and assume. Themouse is missing: the question to be decided is, where is it? Youcan guess both verdicts beforehand. One verdict will say thekitten contains the mouse; the other will as certainly say themouse is in the tomcat.
The Shakespearite will Reason like this--(that is not my word, itis his). He will say the kitten MAY HAVE BEEN attending schoolwhen nobody was noticing; therefore WE ARE WARRANTED IN ASSUMINGthat it did so; also, it COULD HAVE BEEN training in a court-clerk's office when no one was noticing; since that could havehappened, WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN ASSUMING that it did happen; it COULDHAVE STUDIED CATOLOGY IN A GARRET when no one was noticing--therefore it DID; it COULD HAVE attended cat-assizes on the shed-roof nights, for recreation, when no one was noticing, andharvested a knowledge of cat court-forms and cat lawyer-talk inthat way: it COULD have done it, therefore without a doubt it did;it could have gone soldiering with a war-tribe when no one wasnoticing, and learned soldier-wiles and soldier-ways, and what todo with a mouse when opportunity offers; the plain inference,therefore is, that that is what it DID. Since all these manifoldthings COULD have occurred, we have EVERY RIGHT TO BELIEVE they didoccur. These patiently and painstakingly accumulated vastacquirements and competences needed but one thing more--opportunity--to convert themselves into triumphant action. Theopportunity came, we have the result; BEYOND SHADOW OF QUESTION themouse is in the kitten.
It is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a "WETHINK WE MAY ASSUME," we expect it, under careful watering andfertilizing and tending, to grow up into a strong and hardy andweather-defying "THERE ISN'T A SHADOW OF A DOUBT" at last--and itusually happens.
We know what the Baconian's verdict would be: "THERE IS NOT A RAGOF EVIDENCE THAT THE KITTEN HAS HAD ANY TRAINING, ANY EDUCATION,ANY EXPERIENCE QUALIFYING IT FOR THE PRESENT OCCASION, OR IS INDEEDEQUIPPED FOR ANY ACHIEVEMENT ABOVE LIFTING SUCH UNCLAIMED MILK ASCOMES ITS WAY; BUT THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE--UNASSAILABLE PROOF,IN FACT--THAT THE OTHER ANIMAL IS EQUIPPED, TO THE LAST DETAIL,WITH EVERY QUALIFICATION NECESSARY FOR THE EVENT. WITHOUT SHADOWOF DOUBT THE TOMCAT CONTAINS THE MOUSE."
