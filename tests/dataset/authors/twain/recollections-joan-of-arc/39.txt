France Begins to Live Again
JOAN HAD said true: France was on the way to be free.
The war called the Hundred Years' War was very sick to-day. Sick on itsEnglish side--for the very first time since its birth, ninety-one yearsgone by.
Shall we judge battles by the numbers killed and the ruin wrought? Orshall we not rather judge them by the results which flowed from them? Anyone will say that a battle is only truly great or small according to itsresults. Yes, any one will grant that, for it is the truth.
Judged by results, Patay's place is with the few supremely great andimposing battles that have been fought since the peoples of the worldfirst resorted to arms for the settlement of their quarrels. So judged,it is even possible that Patay has no peer among that few just mentioned,but stand alone, as the supremest of historic conflicts. For when itbegan France lay gasping out the remnant of an exhausted life, her casewholly hopeless in the view of all political physicians; when it ended,three hours later, she was convalescent. Convalescent, and nothingrequisite but time and ordinary nursing to bring her back to perfecthealth. The dullest physician of them all could see this, and there wasnone to deny it.
Many death-sick nations have reached convalescence through a series ofbattles, a procession of battles, a weary tale of wasting conflictsstretching over years, but only one has reached it in a single day and bya single battle. That nation is France, and that battle Patay.
Remember it and be proud of it; for you are French, and it is thestateliest fact in the long annals of your country. There it stands, withits head in the clouds! And when you grow up you will go on pilgrimage tothe field of Patay, and stand uncovered in the presence of--what? Amonument with its head in the clouds? Yes. For all nations in all timeshave built monuments on their battle-fields to keep green the memory ofthe perishable deed that was wrought there and of the perishable name ofhim who wrought it; and will France neglect Patay and Joan of Arc? Notfor long. And will she build a monument scaled to their rank as comparedwith the world's other fields and heroes? Perhaps--if there be room forit under the arch of the sky.
But let us look back a little, and consider certain strange andimpressive facts. The Hundred Years' War began in 1337. It raged on andon, year after year and year after year; and at last England stretchedFrance prone with that fearful blow at Crecy. But she rose and struggledon, year after year, and at last again she went down under anotherdevastating blow--Poitiers. She gathered her crippled strength once more,and the war raged on, and on, and still on, year after year, decade afterdecade. Children were born, grew up, married, died--the war raged on;their children in turn grew up, married, died--the war raged on; theirchildren, growing, saw France struck down again; this time under theincredible disaster of Agincourt--and still the war raged on, year afteryear, and in time these children married in their turn.
France was a wreck, a ruin, a desolation. The half of it belonged toEngland, with none to dispute or deny the truth; the other half belongedto nobody--in three months would be flying the English flag; the FrenchKing was making ready to throw away his crown and flee beyond the seas.
Now came the ignorant country-maid out of her remote village andconfronted this hoary war, this all-consuming conflagration that hadswept the land for three generations. Then began the briefest and mostamazing campaign that is recorded in history. In seven weeks it wasfinished. In seven weeks she hopelessly crippled that gigantic war thatwas ninety-one years old. At Orleans she struck it a staggering blow; onthe field of Patay she broke its back.
Think of it. Yes, one can do that; but understand it? Ah, that is anothermatter; none will ever be able to comprehend that stupefying marvel.
Seven weeks--with her and there a little bloodshed. Perhaps the most ofit, in any single fight, at Patay, where the English began six thousandstrong and left two thousand dead upon the field. It is said and believedthat in three battles alone--Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt--near ahundred thousand Frenchmen fell, without counting the thousand otherfights of that long war. The dead of that war make a mournful longlist--an interminable list. Of men slain in the field the count goes bytens of thousands; of innocent women and children slain by bitterhardship and hunger it goes by that appalling term, millions.
It was an ogre, that war; an ogre that went about for near a hundredyears, crunching men and dripping blood from its jaws. And with herlittle hand that child of seventeen struck him down; and yonder he liesstretched on the field of Patay, and will not get up any more while thisold world lasts.
