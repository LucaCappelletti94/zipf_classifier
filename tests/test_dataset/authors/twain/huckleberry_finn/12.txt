If the men went to the island I just expect theyfound the camp fire I built, and watched it all night forJim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us,and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn'tno fault of mine. I played it as low down on them asI could.
When the first streak of day began to show we tiedup to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, andhacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet,and covered up the raft with them so she looked likethere had been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thickas harrow-teeth.
We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavytimber on the Illinois side, and the channel was downthe Missouri shore at that place, so we warn't afraid ofanybody running across us. We laid there all day,and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down theMissouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the bigriver in the middle. I told Jim all about the time Ihad jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she wasa smart one, and if she was to start after us herself shewouldn't set down and watch a camp fire -- no, sir,she'd fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn'tshe tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he betshe did think of it by the time the men was ready tostart, and he believed they must a gone up-town to geta dog and so they lost all that time, or else wewouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeenmile below the village -- no, indeedy, we would be inthat same old town again. So I said I didn't carewhat was the reason they didn't get us as long as theydidn't.
When it was beginning to come on dark we pokedour heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and lookedup and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jimtook up some of the top planks of the raft and built asnug wigwam to get under in blazing weather andrainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floorfor the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above thelevel of the raft, so now the blankets and all the trapswas out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in themiddle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt aboutfive or six inches deep with a frame around it for tohold it to its place; this was to build a fire on insloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep itfrom being seen. We made an extra steering-oar,too, because one of the others might get broke on asnag or something. We fixed up a short forked stickto hang the old lantern on, because we must alwayslight the lantern whenever we see a steamboat comingdown-stream, to keep from getting run over; but wewouldn't have to light it for up-stream boats unless wesee we was in what they call a "crossing"; for theriver was pretty high yet, very low banks being still alittle under water; so up-bound boats didn't alwaysrun the channel, but hunted easy water.
This second night we run between seven and eighthours, with a current that was making over four milean hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took aswim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It waskind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, lay-ing on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn'tever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that welaughed -- only a little kind of a low chuckle. Wehad mighty good weather as a general thing, and noth-ing ever happened to us at all -- that night, nor thenext, nor the next.
Every night we passed towns, some of them awayup on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed oflights; not a house could you see. The fifth night wepassed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world litup. In St. Petersburg they used to say there wastwenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but Inever believed it till I see that wonderful spread oflights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't asound there; everybody was asleep.
Every night now I used to slip ashore towards teno'clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteencents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat;and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roostingcomfortable, and took him along. Pap always said,take a chicken when you get a chance, because if youdon't want him yourself you can easy find somebodythat does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I neversee pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, butthat is what he used to say, anyway.
Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfieldsand borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or apunkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind.Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things ifyou was meaning to pay them back some time; butthe widow said it warn't anything but a soft name forstealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said hereckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partlyright; so the best way would be for us to pick out twoor three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrowthem any more -- then he reckoned it wouldn't be noharm to borrow the others. So we talked it over allone night, drifting along down the river, trying tomake up our minds whether to drop the watermelons,or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. Buttowards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, andconcluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. Wewarn't feeling just right before that, but it was allcomfortable now. I was glad the way it come out,too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and thep'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three monthsyet.
We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up tooearly in the morning or didn't go to bed early enoughin the evening. Take it all round, we lived pretty high.
The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big stormafter midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning,and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayedin the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.When the lightning glared out we could see a bigstraight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on bothsides. By and by says I, "Hel-LO, Jim, looky yon-der!" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on arock. We was drifting straight down for her. Thelightning showed her very distinct. She was leaningover, with part of her upper deck above water, andyou could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear,and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hathanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.
Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and allso mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boywould a felt when I see that wreck laying there somournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. Iwanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little,and see what there was there. So I says:
"Le's land on her, Jim."
But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:
"I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.We's doin' blame' well, en we better let blame' wellalone, as de good book says. Like as not dey's awatchman on dat wrack."
"Watchman your grandmother," I says; "thereain't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk hislife for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this,when it's likely to break up and wash off down theriver any minute?" Jim couldn't say nothing to that,so he didn't try. "And besides," I says, "we mightborrow something worth having out of the captain'sstateroom. Seegars, I bet you -- and cost five centsapiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich,and get sixty dollars a month, and THEY don't care acent what a thing costs, you know, long as they wantit. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim,till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon TomSawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, hewouldn't. He'd call it an adventure -- that's whathe'd call it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was hislast act. And wouldn't he throw style into it? --wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? Why,you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discoveringKingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer WAS here."
Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said wemustn't talk any more than we could help, and thentalk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreckagain just in time, and we fetched the stabboardderrick, and made fast there.
The deck was high out here. We went sneaking downthe slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards thetexas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and spreadingour hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so darkwe couldn't see no sign of them. Pretty soon westruck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb onto it; and the next step fetched us in front of thecaptain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy,away down through the texas-hall we see a light! andall in the same second we seem to hear low voices inyonder!
Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerfulsick, and told me to come along. I says, all right,and was going to start for the raft; but just then Iheard a voice wail out and say:
"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't evertell!"
Another voice said, pretty loud:
"It's a lie, Jim Turner. You've acted this waybefore. You always want more'n your share of thetruck, and you've always got it, too, because you'veswore 't if you didn't you'd tell. But this time you'vesaid it jest one time too many. You're the meanest,treacherousest hound in this country."
By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was justa-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, TomSawyer wouldn't back out now, and so I won't either;I'm a-going to see what's going on here. So Idropped on my hands and knees in the little passage,and crept aft in the dark till there warn't but onestateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas.Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor andtied hand and foot, and two men standing over him,and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, andthe other one had a pistol. This one kept pointingthe pistol at the man's head on the floor, and saying:
"I'd LIKE to! And I orter, too -- a mean skunk!"
The man on the floor would shrivel up and say,"Oh, please don't, Bill; I hain't ever goin' to tell."
And every time he said that the man with the lanternwould laugh and say:
"'Deed you AIN'T! You never said no truer thing'n that, you bet you." And once he said: "Hearhim beg! and yit if we hadn't got the best of him andtied him he'd a killed us both. And what FOR? Jistfor noth'n. Jist because we stood on our RIGHTS --that's what for. But I lay you ain't a-goin' to threatennobody any more, Jim Turner. Put UP that pistol,Bill."
Bill says:
"I don't want to, Jake Packard. I'm for killin'him -- and didn't he kill old Hatfield jist the sameway -- and don't he deserve it?"
"But I don't WANT him killed, and I've got myreasons for it."
"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!I'll never forgit you long's I live!" says the man onthe floor, sort of blubbering.
Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung uphis lantern on a nail and started towards where I wasthere in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. Icrawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but theboat slanted so that I couldn't make very good time;so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawledinto a stateroom on the upper side. The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got tomy stateroom, he says:
"Here -- come in here."
And in he come, and Bill after him. But beforethey got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, andsorry I come. Then they stood there, with their handson the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't seethem, but I could tell where they was by the whiskythey'd been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky;but it wouldn't made much difference anyway, becausemost of the time they couldn't a treed me because Ididn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, abody COULDN'T breathe and hear such talk. Theytalked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner.He says:
"He's said he'll tell, and he will. If we was togive both our shares to him NOW it wouldn't make nodifference after the row and the way we've served him.Shore's you're born, he'll turn State's evidence; nowyou hear ME. I'm for putting him out of his troubles."
"So'm I," says Packard, very quiet.
"Blame it, I'd sorter begun to think you wasnUt.Well, then, that's all right. Le's go and do it."
"Hold on a minute; I hain't had my say yit. Youlisten to me. Shooting's good, but there's quieterways if the thing's GOT to be done. But what I say isthis: it ain't good sense to go court'n around after ahalter if you can git at what you're up to in someway that's jist as good and at the same time don'tbring you into no resks. Ain't that so?"
"You bet it is. But how you goin' to manage itthis time?"
"Well, my idea is this: we'll rustle around and gatherup whatever pickins we've overlooked in the state-rooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Thenwe'll wait. Now I say it ain't a-goin' to be more'ntwo hours befo' this wrack breaks up and washes offdown the river. See? He'll be drownded, and won'thave nobody to blame for it but his own self. Ireckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' ofhim. I'm unfavorable to killin' a man as long as youcan git aroun' it; it ain't good sense, it ain't goodmorals. Ain't I right?"
"Yes, I reck'n you are. But s'pose she DON'Tbreak up and wash off?"
"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see,can't we?"
"All right, then; come along."
So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat,and scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there;but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, "Jim !" andhe answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of amoan, and I says:
"Quick, Jim, it ain't no time for fooling aroundand moaning; there's a gang of murderers in yonder,and if we don't hunt up their boat and set her driftingdown the river so these fellows can't get away from thewreck there's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix.But if we find their boat we can put ALL of 'em in abad fix -- for the sheriff 'll get 'em. Quick -- hurry!I'll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard.You start at the raft, and --"
"Oh, my lordy, lordy! RAF'? Dey ain' no raf'no mo'; she done broke loose en gone I -- en herewe is!"
