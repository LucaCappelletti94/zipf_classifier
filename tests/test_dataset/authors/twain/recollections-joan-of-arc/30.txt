The Fate of France Decided
WE WERE up at dawn, and after mass we started. In the hall we met themaster of the house, who was grieved, good man, to see Joan goingbreakfastless to such a day's work, and begged her to wait and eat, butshe couldn't afford the time--that is to say, she couldn't afford thepatience, she being in such a blaze of anxiety to get at that lastremaining bastille which stood between her and the completion of thefirst great step in the rescue and redemption of France. Boucher put inanother plea:
"But think--we poor beleaguered citizens who have hardly known the flavorof fish for these many months, have spoil of that sort again, and we oweit to you. There's a noble shad for breakfast; wait--be persuaded."
Joan said:
"Oh, there's going to be fish in plenty; when this day's work is done thewhole river-front will be yours to do as you please with."
"Ah, your Excellency will do well, that I know; but we don't requirequite that much, even of you; you shall have a month for it in place of aday. Now be beguiled--wait and eat. There's a saying that he that wouldcross a river twice in the same day in a boat, will do well to eat fishfor luck, lest he have an accident."
"That doesn't fit my case, for to-day I cross but once in a boat."
"Oh, don't say that. Aren't you coming back to us?"
"Yes, but not in a boat."
"How, then?"
"By the bridge."
"Listen to that--by the bridge! Now stop this jesting, dear General, anddo as I would have done you. It's a noble fish."
"Be good then, and save me some for supper; and I will bring one of thoseEnglishmen with me and he shall have his share."
"Ah, well, have your way if you must. But he that fasts must attempt butlittle and stop early. When shall you be back?"
"When we've raised the siege of Orleans. FORWARD!"
We were off. The streets were full of citizens and of groups and squadsof soldiers, but the spectacle was melancholy. There was not a smileanywhere, but only universal gloom. It was as if some vast calamity hadsmitten all hope and cheer dead. We were not used to this, and wereastonished. But when they saw the Maid, there was an immediate stir, andthe eager question flew from mouth to mouth.
"Where is she going? Whither is she bound?"
Joan heard it, and called out:
"Whither would ye suppose? I am going to take the Tourelles."
It would not be possible for any to describe how those few words turnedthat mourning into joy--into exaltation--into frenzy; and how a storm ofhuzzas burst out and swept down the streets in every direction and wokethose corpse-like multitudes to vivid life and action and turmoil in amoment. The soldiers broke from the crowd and came flocking to ourstandard, and many of the citizens ran and got pikes and halberds andjoined us. As we moved on, our numbers increased steadily, and thehurrahing continued--yes, we moved through a solid cloud of noise, as youmay say, and all the windows on both sides contributed to it, for theywere filled with excited people.
You see, the council had closed the Burgundy gate and placed a strongforce there, under that stout soldier Raoul de Gaucourt, Bailly ofOrleans, with orders to prevent Joan from getting out and resuming theattack on the Tourelles, and this shameful thing had plunged the cityinto sorrow and despair. But that feeling was gone now. They believed theMaid was a match for the council, and they were right.
When we reached the gate, Joan told Gaucourt to open it and let her pass.
He said it would be impossible to do this, for his orders were from thecouncil and were strict. Joan said:
"There is no authority above mine but the King's. If you have an orderfrom the King, produce it."
"I cannot claim to have an order from him, General."
"Then make way, or take the consequences!"
He began to argue the case, for he was like the rest of the tribe, alwaysready to fight with words, not acts; but in the midst of his gabble Joaninterrupted with the terse order:
"Charge!"
We came with a rush, and brief work we made of that small job. It wasgood to see the Bailly's surprise. He was not used to this unsentimentalpromptness. He said afterward that he was cut off in the midst of what hewas saying--in the midst of an argument by which he could have provedthat he could not let Joan pass--an argument which Joan could not haveanswered.
"Still, it appears she did answer it," said the person he was talking to.
We swung through the gate in great style, with a vast accession of noise,the most of which was laughter, and soon our van was over the river andmoving down against the Tourelles.
First we must take a supporting work called a boulevard, and which wasotherwise nameless, before we could assault the great bastille. Its rearcommunicated with the bastille by a drawbridge, under which ran a swiftand deep strip of the Loire. The boulevard was strong, and Dunois doubtedour ability to take it, but Joan had no such doubt. She pounded it withartillery all the forenoon, then about noon she ordered an assault andled it herself. We poured into the fosse through the smoke and a tempestof missiles, and Joan, shouting encouragements to her men, started toclimb a scaling-ladder, when that misfortune happened which we knew wasto happen--the iron bolt from an arbaquest struck between her neck andher shoulder, and tore its way down through her armor. When she felt thesharp pain and saw her blood gushing over her breast, she was frightened,poor girl, and as she sank to the ground she began to cry bitterly.
The English sent up a glad shout and came surging down in strong force totake her, and then for a few minutes the might of both adversaries wasconcentrated upon that spot. Over her and above her, English and Frenchfought with desperation--for she stood for France, indeed she was Franceto both sides--whichever won her won France, and could keep it forever.Right there in that small spot, and in ten minutes by the clock, the fateof France, for all time, was to be decided, and was decided.
If the English had captured Joan then, Charles VII. would have flown thecountry, the Treaty of Troyes would have held good, and France, alreadyEnglish property, would have become, without further dispute, an Englishprovince, to so remain until Judgment Day. A nationality and a kingdomwere at stake there, and no more time to decide it in than it takes tohard-boil an egg. It was the most momentous ten minutes that the clockhas ever ticked in France, or ever will. Whenever you read in historiesabout hours or days or weeks in which the fate of one or another nationhung in the balance, do not you fail to remember, nor your French heartsto beat the quicker for the remembrance, the ten minutes that France,called otherwise Joan of Arc, lay bleeding in the fosse that day, withtwo nations struggling over her for her possession.
And you will not forget the Dwarf. For he stood over her, and did thework of any six of the others. He swung his ax with both hands; wheneverit came down, he said those two words, "For France!" and a splinteredhelmet flew like eggshells, and the skull that carried it had learned itsmanners and would offend the French no more. He piled a bulwark ofiron-clad dead in front of him and fought from behind it; and at lastwhen the victory was ours we closed about him, shielding him, and he ranup a ladder with Joan as easily as another man would carry a child, andbore her out of the battle, a great crowd following and anxious, for shewas drenched with blood to her feet, half of it her own and the otherhalf English, for bodies had fallen across her as she lay and had pouredtheir red life-streams over her. One couldn't see the white armor now,with that awful dressing over it.
The iron bolt was still in the wound--some say it projected out behindthe shoulder. It may be--I did not wish to see, and did not try to. Itwas pulled out, and the pain made Joan cry again, poor thing. Some sayshe pulled it out herself because others refused, saying they could notbear to hurt her. As to this I do not know; I only know it was pulledout, and that the wound was treated with oil and properly dressed.
Joan lay on the grass, weak and suffering, hour after hour, but stillinsisting that the fight go on. Which it did, but not to much purpose,for it was only under her eye that men were heroes and not afraid. Theywere like the Paladin; I think he was afraid of his shadow--I mean in theafternoon, when it was very big and long; but when he was under Joan'seye and the inspiration of her great spirit, what was he afraid of?Nothing in this world--and that is just the truth.
Toward night Dunois gave it up. Joan heard the bugles.
"What!" she cried. "Sounding the retreat!"
Her wound was forgotten in a moment. She countermanded the order, andsent another, to the officer in command of a battery, to stand ready tofire five shots in quick succession. This was a signal to the force onthe Orleans side of the river under La Hire, who was not, as some of thehistories say, with us. It was to be given whenever Joan should feel surethe boulevard was about to fall into her hands--then that force must makea counter-attack on the Tourelles by way of the bridge.
Joan mounted her horse now, with her staff about her, and when our peoplesaw us coming they raised a great shout, and were at once eager foranother assault on the boulevard. Joan rode straight to the fosse whereshe had received her wound, and standing there in the rain of bolts andarrows, she ordered the Paladin to let her long standard blow free, andto note when its fringes should touch the fortress. Presently he said:
"It touches."
"Now, then," said Joan to the waiting battalions, "the place isyours--enter in! Bugles, sound the assault! Now, then--all together--go!"
And go it was. You never saw anything like it. We swarmed up the laddersand over the battlements like a wave--and the place was our property.Why, one might live a thousand years and never see so gorgeous a thing asthat again. There, hand to hand, we fought like wild beasts, for therewas no give-up to those English--there was no way to convince one ofthose people but to kill him, and even then he doubted. At least so itwas thought, in those days, and maintained by many.
We were busy and never heard the five cannon-shots fired, but they werefired a moment after Joan had ordered the assault; and so, while we werehammering and being hammered in the smaller fortress, the reserve on theOrleans side poured across the bridge and attacked the Tourelles fromthat side. A fire-boat was brought down and moored under the drawbridgewhich connected the Tourelles with our boulevard; wherefore, when at lastwe drove our English ahead of us and they tried to cross that drawbridgeand join their friends in the Tourelles, the burning timbers gave wayunder them and emptied them in a mass into the river in their heavyarmor--and a pitiful sight it was to see brave men die such a death asthat.
"Ah, God pity them!" said Joan, and wept to see that sorrowful spectacle.She said those gentle words and wept those compassionate tears althoughone of those perishing men had grossly insulted her with a coarse namethree days before, when she had sent him a message asking him tosurrender. That was their leader, Sir Williams Glasdale, a most valorousknight. He was clothed all in steel; so he plunged under water like alance, and of course came up no more.
We soon patched a sort of bridge together and threw ourselves against thelast stronghold of the English power that barred Orleans from friends andsupplies. Before the sun was quite down, Joan's forever memorable day'swork was finished, her banner floated from the fortress of the Tourelles,her promise was fulfilled, she had raised the siege of Orleans!
The seven months' beleaguerment was ended, the thing which the firstgenerals of France had called impossible was accomplished; in spite ofall that the King's ministers and war-councils could do to prevent it,this little country-maid at seventeen had carried her immortal taskthrough, and had done it in four days!
Good news travels fast, sometimes, as well as bad. By the time we wereready to start homeward by the bridge the whole city of Orleans was onered flame of bonfires, and the heavens blushed with satisfaction to seeit; and the booming and bellowing of cannon and the banging of bellssurpassed by great odds anything that even Orleans had attempted beforein the way of noise.
When we arrived--well, there is no describing that. Why, those acres ofpeople that we plowed through shed tears enough to raise the river; therewas not a face in the glare of those fires that hadn't tears streamingdown it; and if Joan's feet had not been protected by iron they wouldhave kissed them off of her. "Welcome! welcome to the Maid of Orleans!"That was the cry; I heard it a hundred thousand times. "Welcome to ourMaid!" some of them worded it.
No other girl in all history has ever reached such a summit of glory asJoan of Arc reached that day. And do you think it turned her head, andthat she sat up to enjoy that delicious music of homage and applause? No;another girl would have done that, but not this one. That was thegreatest heart and the simplest that ever beat. She went straight to bedand to sleep, like any tired child; and when the people found she waswounded and would rest, they shut off all passage and traffic in thatregion and stood guard themselves the whole night through, to see that heslumbers were not disturbed. They said, "She has given us peace, sheshall have peace herself."
All knew that that region would be empty of English next day, and allsaid that neither the present citizens nor their posterity would evercease to hold that day sacred to the memory of Joan of Arc. That word hasbeen true for more than sixty years; it will continue so always. Orleanswill never forget the 8th of May, nor ever fail to celebrate it. It isJoan of Arc's day--and holy. [1]
