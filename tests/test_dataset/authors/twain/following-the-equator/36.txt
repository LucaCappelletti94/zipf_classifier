Friday, December 13.   Sailed, at 3 p.m., in the 'Mararoa'.  Summer seasand a good ship-life has nothing better.
Monday.  Three days of paradise.  Warm and sunny and smooth; the sea aluminous Mediterranean blue .  .  .  .  One lolls in a long chair all dayunder deck-awnings, and reads and smokes, in measureless content.  Onedoes not read prose at such a time, but poetry.  I have been reading thepoems of Mrs. Julia A.  Moore, again, and I find in them the same graceand melody that attracted me when they were first published, twenty yearsago, and have held me in happy bonds ever since.
"The Sentimental Song Book" has long been out of print, and has beenforgotten by the world in general, but not by me.  I carry it with mealways--it and Goldsmith's deathless story.
Indeed, it has the same deep charm for me that the Vicar of Wakefieldhas, and I find in it the same subtle touch--the touch that makes anintentionally humorous episode pathetic and an intentionally pathetic onefunny.  In her time Mrs. Moore was called "the Sweet Singer of Michigan,"and was best known by that name.  I have read her book through twicetoday, with the purpose of determining which of her pieces has mostmerit, and I am persuaded that for wide grasp and sustained power,"William Upson" may claim first place:
WILLIAM UPSON.
Air--"The Major's Only Son."Come all good people far and near,Oh, come and see what you can hear,It's of a young man true and brave,That is now sleeping in his grave.
Now, William Upson was his nameIf it's not that, it's all the sameHe did enlist in a cruel strife,And it caused him to lose his life.
He was Perry Upson's eldest son,His father loved his noble son,This son was nineteen years of ageWhen first in the rebellion he engaged.
His father said that he might go,But his dear mother she said no,"Oh! stay at home, dear Billy," she said,But she could not turn his head.
He went to Nashville, in Tennessee,There his kind friends he could not see;He died among strangers, so far away,They did not know where his body lay.
He was taken sick and lived four weeks,And Oh! how his parents weep,But now they must in sorrow mourn,For Billy has gone to his heavenly home.
Oh! if his mother could have seen her son,For she loved him, her darling son;If she could heard his dying prayer,It would ease her heart till she met him there.
How it would relieve his mother's heartTo see her son from this world depart,And hear his noble words of love,As he left this world for that above.
Now it will relieve his mother's heart,For her son is laid in our graveyard;For now she knows that his grave is near,She will not shed so many tears.
Although she knows not that it was her son,For his coffin could not be openedIt might be someone in his place,For she could not see his noble face.
December, 17.  Reached Sydney.
December, 19.  In the train.  Fellow of 30 with four valises; a slimcreature, with teeth which made his mouth look like a neglectedchurchyard.  He had solidified hair--solidified with pomatum; it was allone shell.  He smoked the most extraordinary cigarettes--made of somekind of manure, apparently.  These and his hair made him smell like thevery nation.  He had a low-cut vest on, which exposed a deal of frayedand broken and unclean shirtfront.  Showy studs, of imitation gold--theyhad made black disks on the linen.  Oversized sleeve buttons of imitationgold, the copper base showing through.  Ponderous watch-chain ofimitation gold.  I judge that he couldn't tell the time by it, for heasked Smythe what time it was, once.  He wore a coat which had been gaywhen it was young; 5-o'clock-tea-trousers of a light tint, andmarvelously soiled; yellow mustache with a dashing upward whirl at theends; foxy shoes, imitation patent leather.  He was a novelty--animitation dude.  He would have been a real one if he could have affordedit.  But he was satisfied with himself.  You could see it in hisexpression, and in all his attitudes and movements.  He was living in adude dreamland where all his squalid shams were genuine, and himself asincerity.  It disarmed criticism, it mollified spite, to see him soenjoy his imitation languors, and arts, and airs, and his studieddaintinesses of gesture and misbegotten refinements.  It was plain to methat he was imagining himself the Prince of Wales, and was doingeverything the way he thought the Prince would do it.  For bringing hisfour valises aboard and stowing them in the nettings, he gave his porterfour cents, and lightly apologized for the smallness of the gratuity--just with the condescendingest little royal air in the world.  Hestretched himself out on the front seat and rested his pomatum-cake onthe middle arm, and stuck his feet out of the window, and began to poseas the Prince and work his dreams and languors for exhibition; and hewould indolently watch the blue films curling up from his cigarette, andinhale the stench, and look so grateful; and would flip the ash away withthe daintiest gesture, unintentionally displaying his brass ring in themost intentional way; why, it was as good as being in Marlborough Houseitself to see him do it so like.
There was other scenery in the trip.  That of the Hawksbury river, in theNational Park region, fine--extraordinarily fine, with spacious views ofstream and lake imposingly framed in woody hills; and every now and thenthe noblest groupings of mountains, and the most enchantingrearrangements of the water effects.  Further along, green flats, thinlycovered with gum forests, with here and there the huts and cabins ofsmall farmers engaged in raising children.  Still further along, aridstretches, lifeless and melancholy.  Then Newcastle, a rushing town,capital of the rich coal regions.  Approaching Scone, wide farming andgrazing levels, with pretty frequent glimpses of a troublesome plant--aparticularly devilish little prickly pear, daily damned in the orisons ofthe agriculturist; imported by a lady of sentiment, and contributedgratis to the colony. Blazing hot, all day.
December 20.  Back to Sydney.  Blazing hot again.  From the newspaper,and from the map, I have made a collection of curious names ofAustralasian towns, with the idea of making a poem out of them:

It may be best to build the poem now, and make the weather help
                    A SWELTERING DAY IN AUSTRALIA.
          (To be read soft and low, with the lights turned down.)
               The Bombola faints in the hot Bowral tree,               Where fierce Mullengudgery's smothering fires               Far from the breezes of Coolgardie               Burn ghastly and blue as the day expires;
               And Murriwillumba complaineth in song               For the garlanded bowers of Woolloomooloo,               And the Ballarat Fly and the lone Wollongong               They dream of the gardens of Jamberoo;
               The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgee,               For the velvety sod of the Munno Parah,               Where the waters of healing from Muloowurtie               Flow dim in the gloaming by Yaranyackah;
               The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway,               And sigheth in secret for Murrurundi,               The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day               That made him an exile from Jerrilderie;
               The Teawamute Tumut from Wirrega's glade,               The Nangkita swallow, the Wallaroo swan,               They long for the peace of the Timaru shade               And thy balmy soft airs, O sweet Mittagong!
               The Kooringa buffalo pants in the sun,               The Kondoparinga lies gaping for breath,               The Kongorong Camaum to the shadow has won,               But the Goomeroo sinks in the slumber of death;
               In the weltering hell of the Moorooroo plain               The Yatala Wangary withers and dies,               And the Worrow Wanilla, demented with pain,               To the Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies;
               Sweet Nangwarry's desolate, Coonamble wails,               And Tungkillo Kuito in sables is drest,               For the Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails               And the Booleroo life-breeze is dead in the west.
               Mypongo, Kapunda, O slumber no more               Yankalilla, Parawirra, be warned               There's death in the air!               Killanoola, wherefore               Shall the prayer of Penola be scorned?
               Cootamundra, and Takee, and Wakatipu,               Toowoomba, Kaikoura are lost               From Onkaparinga to far Oamaru               All burn in this hell's holocaust!
               Paramatta and Binnum are gone to their rest               In the vale of Tapanni Taroom,               Kawakawa, Deniliquin--all that was best               In the earth are but graves and a tomb!
               Narrandera mourns, Cameron answers not               When the roll of the scathless we cry               Tongariro, Goondiwindi, Woolundunga, the spot               Is mute and forlorn where ye lie.
Those are good words for poetry.  Among the best I have ever seen.There are 81 in the list.  I did not need them all, but I have knockeddown 66 of them; which is a good bag, it seems to me, for a person not inthe business.  Perhaps a poet laureate could do better, but a poetlaureate gets wages, and that is different.  When I write poetry I do notget any wages; often I lose money by it.  The best word in that list, andthe most musical and gurgly, is Woolloomoolloo.  It is a place nearSydney, and is a favorite pleasure-resort.  It has eight O's in it.
