  How many times, like lotus lilies risen	 Upon the surface of a river, there	 Have risen floating on my blood the rare	Soft glimmers of my hope escaped from prison.	 So I am clothed all over with the light  And sensitive beautiful blossoming of passion;	 Till naked for her in the finest fashion	The flowers of all my mud swim into sight.	 And then I offer all myself unto	 This woman who likes to love me: but she turns  A look of hate upon the flower that burns	To break and pour her out its precious dew.	 And slowly all the blossom shuts in pain,	 And all the lotus buds of love sink over	 To die unopened: when my moon-faced lover, Kind on the weight of suffering, smiles again.
