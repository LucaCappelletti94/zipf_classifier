When I last made a memorandum, we were at Ephesus. We are in Syria, now,encamped in the mountains of Lebanon. The interregnum has been long,both as to time and distance. We brought not a relic from Ephesus!After gathering up fragments of sculptured marbles and breaking ornamentsfrom the interior work of the Mosques; and after bringing them at a costof infinite trouble and fatigue, five miles on muleback to the railwaydepot, a government officer compelled all who had such things todisgorge! He had an order from Constantinople to look out for our party,and see that we carried nothing off. It was a wise, a just, and awell-deserved rebuke, but it created a sensation. I never resist atemptation to plunder a stranger's premises without feeling insufferablyvain about it. This time I felt proud beyond expression. I was serenein the midst of the scoldings that were heaped upon the Ottomangovernment for its affront offered to a pleasuring party of entirelyrespectable gentlemen and ladies I said, "We that have free souls, ittouches us not." The shoe not only pinched our party, but it pinchedhard; a principal sufferer discovered that the imperial order wasinclosed in an envelop bearing the seal of the British Embassy atConstantinople, and therefore must have been inspired by therepresentative of the Queen. This was bad--very bad. Coming solelyfrom the Ottomans, it might have signified only Ottoman hatred ofChristians, and a vulgar ignorance as to genteel methods of expressingit; but coming from the Christianized, educated, politic Britishlegation, it simply intimated that we were a sort of gentlemen andladies who would bear watching! So the party regarded it, and wereincensed accordingly. The truth doubtless was, that the sameprecautions would have been taken against any travelers, because theEnglish Company who have acquired the right to excavate Ephesus, andhave paid a great sum for that right, need to be protected, and deserveto be. They can not afford to run the risk of having their hospitalityabused by travelers, especially since travelers are such notoriousscorners of honest behavior.
We sailed from Smyrna, in the wildest spirit of expectancy, for the chieffeature, the grand goal of the expedition, was near at hand--we wereapproaching the Holy Land! Such a burrowing into the hold for trunksthat had lain buried for weeks, yes for months; such a hurrying to andfro above decks and below; such a riotous system of packing andunpacking; such a littering up of the cabins with shirts and skirts, andindescribable and unclassable odds and ends; such a making up of bundles,and setting apart of umbrellas, green spectacles and thick veils; such acritical inspection of saddles and bridles that had never yet touchedhorses; such a cleaning and loading of revolvers and examining ofbowie-knives; such a half-soling of the seats of pantaloons withserviceable buckskin; then such a poring over ancient maps; such areading up of Bibles and Palestine travels; such a marking out ofroutes; such exasperating efforts to divide up the company into littlebands of congenial spirits who might make the long and arduous Journeywithout quarreling; and morning, noon and night, such mass-meetings inthe cabins, such speech-making, such sage suggesting, such worrying andquarreling, and such a general raising of the very mischief, was neverseen in the ship before!
But it is all over now. We are cut up into parties of six or eight, andby this time are scattered far and wide. Ours is the only one, however,that is venturing on what is called "the long trip"--that is, out intoSyria, by Baalbec to Damascus, and thence down through the full length ofPalestine. It would be a tedious, and also a too risky journey, at thishot season of the year, for any but strong, healthy men, accustomedsomewhat to fatigue and rough life in the open air. The other partieswill take shorter journeys.
For the last two months we have been in a worry about one portion of thisHoly Land pilgrimage. I refer to transportation service. We knew verywell that Palestine was a country which did not do a large passengerbusiness, and every man we came across who knew any thing about it gaveus to understand that not half of our party would be able to get dragomenand animals. At Constantinople every body fell to telegraphing theAmerican Consuls at Alexandria and Beirout to give notice that we wanteddragomen and transportation. We were desperate--would take horses,jackasses, cameleopards, kangaroos--any thing. At Smyrna, moretelegraphing was done, to the same end. Also fearing for the worst, wetelegraphed for a large number of seats in the diligence for Damascus,and horses for the ruins of Baalbec.
As might have been expected, a notion got abroad in Syria and Egypt thatthe whole population of the Province of America (the Turks consider us atrifling little province in some unvisited corner of the world,) werecoming to the Holy Land--and so, when we got to Beirout yesterday, wefound the place full of dragomen and their outfits. We had all intendedto go by diligence to Damascus, and switch off to Baalbec as we wentalong--because we expected to rejoin the ship, go to Mount Carmel, andtake to the woods from there. However, when our own private party ofeight found that it was possible, and proper enough, to make the "longtrip," we adopted that programme. We have never been much trouble to aConsul before, but we have been a fearful nuisance to our Consul atBeirout. I mention this because I can not help admiring his patience,his industry, and his accommodating spirit. I mention it also, because Ithink some of our ship's company did not give him as full credit for hisexcellent services as he deserved.
Well, out of our eight, three were selected to attend to all businessconnected with the expedition. The rest of us had nothing to do but lookat the beautiful city of Beirout, with its bright, new houses nestledamong a wilderness of green shrubbery spread abroad over an upland thatsloped gently down to the sea; and also at the mountains of Lebanon thatenviron it; and likewise to bathe in the transparent blue water thatrolled its billows about the ship (we did not know there were sharksthere.) We had also to range up and down through the town and look at thecostumes. These are picturesque and fanciful, but not so varied as atConstantinople and Smyrna; the women of Beirout add an agony--in the twoformer cities the sex wear a thin veil which one can see through (andthey often expose their ancles,) but at Beirout they cover their entirefaces with dark-colored or black veils, so that they look like mummies,and then expose their breasts to the public. A young gentleman (Ibelieve he was a Greek,) volunteered to show us around the city, and saidit would afford him great pleasure, because he was studying English andwanted practice in that language. When we had finished the rounds,however, he called for remuneration--said he hoped the gentlemen wouldgive him a trifle in the way of a few piastres (equivalent to a few fivecent pieces.) We did so. The Consul was surprised when he heard it, andsaid he knew the young fellow's family very well, and that they were anold and highly respectable family and worth a hundred and fifty thousanddollars! Some people, so situated, would have been ashamed of the berthhe had with us and his manner of crawling into it.
At the appointed time our business committee reported, and said allthings were in readdress--that we were to start to-day, with horses, packanimals, and tents, and go to Baalbec, Damascus, the Sea of Tiberias, andthence southward by the way of the scene of Jacob's Dream and othernotable Bible localities to Jerusalem--from thence probably to the DeadSea, but possibly not--and then strike for the ocean and rejoin the shipthree or four weeks hence at Joppa; terms, five dollars a day apiece, ingold, and every thing to be furnished by the dragoman. They said wewould lie as well as at a hotel. I had read something like that before,and did not shame my judgment by believing a word of it. I said nothing,however, but packed up a blanket and a shawl to sleep in, pipes andtobacco, two or three woollen shirts, a portfolio, a guide-book, and aBible. I also took along a towel and a cake of soap, to inspire respectin the Arabs, who would take me for a king in disguise.
We were to select our horses at 3 P.M. At that hour Abraham, thedragoman, marshaled them before us. With all solemnity I set it downhere, that those horses were the hardest lot I ever did come across, andtheir accoutrements were in exquisite keeping with their style. Onebrute had an eye out; another had his tail sawed off close, like arabbit, and was proud of it; another had a bony ridge running from hisneck to his tail, like one of those ruined aqueducts one sees about Rome,and had a neck on him like a bowsprit; they all limped, and had sorebacks, and likewise raw places and old scales scattered about theirpersons like brass nails in a hair trunk; their gaits were marvelous tocontemplate, and replete with variety under way the procession lookedlike a fleet in a storm. It was fearful. Blucher shook his head andsaid:
"That dragon is going to get himself into trouble fetching these oldcrates out of the hospital the way they are, unless he has got a permit."
I said nothing. The display was exactly according to the guide-book, andwere we not traveling by the guide-book? I selected a certain horsebecause I thought I saw him shy, and I thought that a horse that hadspirit enough to shy was not to be despised.
At 6 o'clock P.M., we came to a halt here on the breezy summit of ashapely mountain overlooking the sea, and the handsome valley where dweltsome of those enterprising Phoenicians of ancient times we read so muchabout; all around us are what were once the dominions of Hiram, King ofTyre, who furnished timber from the cedars of these Lebanon hills tobuild portions of King Solomon's Temple with.
Shortly after six, our pack train arrived. I had not seen it before, anda good right I had to be astonished. We had nineteen serving men andtwenty-six pack mules! It was a perfect caravan. It looked like one,too, as it wound among the rocks. I wondered what in the very mischiefwe wanted with such a vast turn-out as that, for eight men. I wonderedawhile, but soon I began to long for a tin plate, and some bacon andbeans. I had camped out many and many a time before, and knew just whatwas coming. I went off, without waiting for serving men, and unsaddledmy horse, and washed such portions of his ribs and his spine as projectedthrough his hide, and when I came back, behold five stately circus tentswere up--tents that were brilliant, within, with blue, and gold, andcrimson, and all manner of splendid adornment! I was speechless. Thenthey brought eight little iron bedsteads, and set them up in the tents;they put a soft mattress and pillows and good blankets and two snow-whitesheets on each bed. Next, they rigged a table about the centre-pole, andon it placed pewter pitchers, basins, soap, and the whitest of towels--one set for each man; they pointed to pockets in the tent, and said wecould put our small trifles in them for convenience, and if we neededpins or such things, they were sticking every where. Then came thefinishing touch--they spread carpets on the floor! I simply said, "Ifyou call this camping out, all right--but it isn't the style I am usedto; my little baggage that I brought along is at a discount."
It grew dark, and they put candles on the tables--candles set in bright,new, brazen candlesticks. And soon the bell--a genuine, simon-pure bell--rang, and we were invited to "the saloon." I had thought before thatwe had a tent or so too many, but now here was one, at least, providedfor; it was to be used for nothing but an eating-saloon. Like theothers, it was high enough for a family of giraffes to live in, and wasvery handsome and clean and bright-colored within. It was a gem of aplace. A table for eight, and eight canvas chairs; a table-cloth andnapkins whose whiteness and whose fineness laughed to scorn the things wewere used to in the great excursion steamer; knives and forks,soup-plates, dinner-plates--every thing, in the handsomest kind ofstyle. It was wonderful! And they call this camping out. Thosestately fellows in baggy trowsers and turbaned fezzes brought in adinner which consisted of roast mutton, roast chicken, roast goose,potatoes, bread, tea, pudding, apples, and delicious grapes; the viandswere better cooked than any we had eaten for weeks, and the table made afiner appearance, with its large German silver candlesticks and otherfinery, than any table we had sat down to for a good while, and yet thatpolite dragoman, Abraham, came bowing in and apologizing for the wholeaffair, on account of the unavoidable confusion of getting under way fora very long trip, and promising to do a great deal better in future!
It is midnight, now, and we break camp at six in the morning.
They call this camping out. At this rate it is a glorious privilege tobe a pilgrim to the Holy Land.
