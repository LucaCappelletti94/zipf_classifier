Be careless in your dress if you must, but keep a tidy soul. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
We left Adelaide in due course, and went to Horsham, in the colony ofVictoria; a good deal of a journey, if I remember rightly, but pleasant.Horsham sits in a plain which is as level as a floor--one of those famousdead levels which Australian books describe so often; gray, bare, sombre,melancholy, baked, cracked, in the tedious long drouths, but ahorizonless ocean of vivid green grass the day after a rain. A countrytown, peaceful, reposeful, inviting, full of snug homes, with gardenplots, and plenty of shrubbery and flowers.
"Horsham, October 17.At the hotel. The weather divine. Across the way, in front of theLondon Bank of Australia, is a very handsome cottonwood. It is inopulent leaf, and every leaf perfect. The full power of the on-rushingspring is upon it, and I imagine I can see it grow. Alongside the bankand a little way back in the garden there is a row of soaringfountain-sprays of delicate feathery foliage quivering in the breeze, andmottled with flashes of light that shift and play through the mass likeflash-lights through an opal--a most beautiful tree, and a strikingcontrast to the cottonwood. Every leaf of the cottonwood is distinctlydefined--it is a kodak for faithful, hard, unsentimental detail; theother an impressionist picture, delicious to look upon, full of a subtleand exquisite charm, but all details fused in a swoon of vague and softloveliness."
It turned out, upon inquiry, to be a pepper tree--an importation fromChina. It has a silky sheen, soft and rich. I saw some that had longred bunches of currant-like berries ambushed among the foliage. At adistance, in certain lights, they give the tree a pinkish tint and a newcharm.
There is an agricultural college eight miles from Horsham. We weredriven out to it by its chief. The conveyance was an open wagon; thetime, noonday; no wind; the sky without a cloud, the sunshine brilliant--and the mercury at 92 deg. in the shade. In some countries an indolentunsheltered drive of an hour and a half under such conditions would havebeen a sweltering and prostrating experience; but there was nothing ofthat in this case. It is a climate that is perfect. There was no senseof heat; indeed, there was no heat; the air was fine and pure andexhilarating; if the drive had lasted half a day I think we should nothave felt any discomfort, or grown silent or droopy or tired. Of course,the secret of it was the exceeding dryness of the atmosphere. In thatplain 112 deg. in the shade is without doubt no harder upon a man than is88 or 90 deg. in New York.
The road lay through the middle of an empty space which seemed to me tobe a hundred yards wide between the fences. I was not given the width inyards, but only in chains and perches--and furlongs, I think. I wouldhave given a good deal to know what the width was, but I did not pursuethe matter. I think it is best to put up with information the way youget it; and seem satisfied with it, and surprised at it, and grateful forit, and say, "My word!" and never let on. It was a wide space; I couldtell you how wide, in chains and perches and furlongs and things, butthat would not help you any. Those things sound well, but they areshadowy and indefinite, like troy weight and avoirdupois; nobody knowswhat they mean. When you buy a pound of a drug and the man asks youwhich you want, troy or avoirdupois, it is best to say "Yes," and shiftthe subject.
They said that the wide space dates from the earliest sheep andcattle-raising days. People had to drive their stock long distances--immense journeys--from worn-out places to new ones where were waterand fresh pasturage; and this wide space had to be left in grass andunfenced, or the stock would have starved to death in the transit.
On the way we saw the usual birds--the beautiful little green parrots,the magpie, and some others; and also the slender native bird of modestplumage and the eternally-forgettable name--the bird that is the smartestamong birds, and can give a parrot 30 to 1 in the game and then talk himto death. I cannot recall that bird's name. I think it begins with M.I wish it began with G. or something that a person can remember.
The magpie was out in great force, in the fields and on the fences. Heis a handsome large creature, with snowy white decorations, and is asinger; he has a murmurous rich note that is lovely. He was once modest,even diffident; but he lost all that when he found out that he wasAustralia's sole musical bird. He has talent, and cuteness, andimpudence; and in his tame state he is a most satisfactory pet--nevercoming when he is called, always coming when he isn't, and studyingdisobedience as an accomplishment. He is not confined, but loafs allover the house and grounds, like the laughing jackass. I think he learnsto talk, I know he learns to sing tunes, and his friends say that heknows how to steal without learning. I was acquainted with a tame magpiein Melbourne. He had lived in a lady's house several years, and believedhe owned it. The lady had tamed him, and in return he had tamed thelady. He was always on deck when not wanted, always having his own way,always tyrannizing over the dog, and always making the cat's life a slowsorrow and a martyrdom. He knew a number of tunes and could sing them inperfect time and tune; and would do it, too, at any time that silence waswanted; and then encore himself and do it again; but if he was asked tosing he would go out and take a walk.
It was long believed that fruit trees would not grow in that baked andwaterless plain around Horsham, but the agricultural college hasdissipated that idea. Its ample nurseries were producing oranges,apricots, lemons, almonds, peaches, cherries, 48 varieties of apples--infact, all manner of fruits, and in abundance. The trees did not seem tomiss the water; they were in vigorous and flourishing condition.
Experiments are made with different soils, to see what things thrive bestin them and what climates are best for them. A man who is ignorantlytrying to produce upon his farm things not suited to its soil and itsother conditions can make a journey to the college from anywhere inAustralia, and go back with a change of scheme which will make his farmproductive and profitable.
There were forty pupils there--a few of them farmers, relearning theirtrade, the rest young men mainly from the cities--novices. It seemed astrange thing that an agricultural college should have an attraction forcity-bred youths, but such is the fact. They are good stuff, too; theyare above the agricultural average of intelligence, and they come withoutany inherited prejudices in favor of hoary ignorances made sacred by longdescent.
The students work all day in the fields, the nurseries, and theshearing-sheds, learning and doing all the practical work of thebusiness--three days in a week. On the other three they study and hearlectures. They are taught the beginnings of such sciences as bear uponagriculture--like chemistry, for instance. We saw the sophomore class insheep-shearing shear a dozen sheep. They did it by hand, not with themachine. The sheep was seized and flung down on his side and held there;and the students took off his coat with great celerity and adroitness.Sometimes they clipped off a sample of the sheep, but that is customarywith shearers, and they don't mind it; they don't even mind it as much asthe sheep. They dab a splotch of sheep-dip on the place and go rightahead.
The coat of wool was unbelievably thick. Before the shearing the sheeplooked like the fat woman in the circus; after it he looked like a bench.He was clipped to the skin; and smoothly and uniformly. The fleece comesfrom him all in one piece and has the spread of a blanket.
The college was flying the Australian flag--the gridiron of Englandsmuggled up in the northwest corner of a big red field that had therandom stars of the Southern Cross wandering around over it.
From Horsham we went to Stawell. By rail. Still in the colony ofVictoria. Stawell is in the gold-mining country. In the bank-safe washalf a peck of surface-gold--gold dust, grain gold; rich; pure in fact,and pleasant to sift through one's fingers; and would be pleasanter if itwould stick. And there were a couple of gold bricks, very heavy tohandle, and worth $7,500 a piece. They were from a very valuable quartzmine; a lady owns two-thirds of it; she has an income of $75,000 a monthfrom it, and is able to keep house.
The Stawell region is not productive of gold only; it has greatvineyards, and produces exceptionally fine wines. One of thesevineyards--the Great Western, owned by Mr. Irving--is regarded as amodel. Its product has reputation abroad. It yields a choice champagneand a fine claret, and its hock took a prize in France two or three yearsago. The champagne is kept in a maze of passages under ground, cut inthe rock, to secure it an even temperature during the three-year termrequired to perfect it. In those vaults I saw 120,000 bottles ofchampagne. The colony of Victoria has a population of 1,000,000, andthose people are said to drink 25,000,000 bottles of champagne per year.The dryest community on the earth. The government has lately reduced theduty upon foreign wines. That is one of the unkindnesses of Protection.A man invests years of work and a vast sum of money in a worthyenterprise, upon the faith of existing laws; then the law is changed, andthe man is robbed by his own government.
On the way back to Stawell we had a chance to see a group of boulderscalled the Three Sisters--a curiosity oddly located; for it was upon highground, with the land sloping away from it, and no height above it fromwhence the boulders could have rolled down. Relics of an earlyice-drift, perhaps. They are noble boulders. One of them has the sizeand smoothness and plump sphericity of a balloon of the biggest pattern.
The road led through a forest of great gum-trees, lean and scraggy andsorrowful. The road was cream-white--a clayey kind of earth, apparently.Along it toiled occasional freight wagons, drawn by long double files ofoxen. Those wagons were going a journey of two hundred miles, I wastold, and were running a successful opposition to the railway! Therailways are owned and run by the government.
Those sad gums stood up out of the dry white clay, pictures of patienceand resignation. It is a tree that can get along without water; still itis fond of it--ravenously so. It is a very intelligent tree and willdetect the presence of hidden water at a distance of fifty feet, and sendout slender long root-fibres to prospect it. They will find it; and willalso get at it even through a cement wall six inches thick. Once acement water-pipe under ground at Stawell began to gradually reduce itsoutput, and finally ceased altogether to deliver water. Upon examininginto the matter it was found stopped up, wadded compactly with a mass ofroot-fibres, delicate and hair-like. How this stuff had gotten into thepipe was a puzzle for some little time; finally it was found that it hadcrept in through a crack that was almost invisible to the eye. A gumtree forty feet away had tapped the pipe and was drinking the water.
