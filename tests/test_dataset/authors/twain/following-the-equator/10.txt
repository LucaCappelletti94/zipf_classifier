Everything human is pathetic. The secret source of Humor itself is notjoy but sorrow. There is no humor in heaven. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Captain Cook found Australia in 1770, and eighteen years later theBritish Government began to transport convicts to it. Altogether, NewSouth Wales received 83,000 in 53 years. The convicts wore heavy chains;they were ill-fed and badly treated by the officers set over them; theywere heavily punished for even slight infractions of the rules; "thecruelest discipline ever known" is one historian's description of theirlife.--[The Story of Australasia. J. S. Laurie.]
English law was hard-hearted in those days. For trifling offenses whichin our day would be punished by a small fine or a few days' confinement,men, women, and boys were sent to this other end of the earth to serveterms of seven and fourteen years; and for serious crimes they weretransported for life. Children were sent to the penal colonies for sevenyears for stealing a rabbit!
When I was in London twenty-three years ago there was a new penalty inforce for diminishing garroting and wife-beating--25 lashes on the bareback with the cat-o'-nine-tails. It was said that this terriblepunishment was able to bring the stubbornest ruffians to terms; and thatno man had been found with grit enough to keep his emotions to himselfbeyond the ninth blow; as a rule the man shrieked earlier. That penaltyhad a great and wholesome effect upon the garroters and wife-beaters; buthumane modern London could not endure it; it got its law rescinded. Manya bruised and battered English wife has since had occasion to deplorethat cruel achievement of sentimental "humanity."
Twenty-five lashes! In Australia and Tasmania they gave a convict fiftyfor almost any little offense; and sometimes a brutal officer would addfifty, and then another fifty, and so on, as long as the sufferer couldendure the torture and live. In Tasmania I read the entry, in an oldmanuscript official record, of a case where a convict was given threehundred lashes--for stealing some silver spoons. And men got more thanthat, sometimes. Who handled the cat? Often it was another convict;sometimes it was the culprit's dearest comrade; and he had to lay on withall his might; otherwise he would get a flogging himself for his mercy--for he was under watch--and yet not do his friend any good: the friendwould be attended to by another hand and suffer no lack in the matter offull punishment.
The convict life in Tasmania was so unendurable, and suicide so difficultto accomplish that once or twice despairing men got together and drewstraws to determine which of them should kill another of the group--thismurder to secure death to the perpetrator and to the witnesses of it bythe hand of the hangman!
The incidents quoted above are mere hints, mere suggestions of whatconvict life was like--they are but a couple of details tossed into viewout of a shoreless sea of such; or, to change the figure, they are but apair of flaming steeples photographed from a point which hides from sightthe burning city which stretches away from their bases on every hand.
Some of the convicts--indeed, a good many of them--were very bad people,even for that day; but the most of them were probably not noticeablyworse than the average of the people they left behind them at home. Wemust believe this; we cannot avoid it. We are obliged to believe that anation that could look on, unmoved, and see starving or freezing womenhanged for stealing twenty-six cents' worth of bacon or rags, and boyssnatched from their mothers, and men from their families, and sent to theother side of the world for long terms of years for similar triflingoffenses, was a nation to whom the term "civilized" could not in anylarge way be applied. And we must also believe that a nation that knew,during more than forty years, what was happening to those exiles and wasstill content with it, was not advancing in any showy way toward a highergrade of civilization.
If we look into the characters and conduct of the officers and gentlemenwho had charge of the convicts and attended to their backs and stomachs,we must grant again that as between the convict and his masters, andbetween both and the nation at home, there was a quite noticeablemonotony of sameness.
Four years had gone by, and many convicts had come. Respectable settlerswere beginning to arrive. These two classes of colonists had to beprotected, in case of trouble among themselves or with the natives. Itis proper to mention the natives, though they could hardly count theywere so scarce. At a time when they had not as yet begun to be muchdisturbed--not as yet being in the way--it was estimated that in NewSouth Wales there was but one native to 45,000 acres of territory.
People had to be protected. Officers of the regular army did not wantthis service--away off there where neither honor nor distinction was tobe gained. So England recruited and officered a kind of militia force of1,000 uniformed civilians called the "New South Wales Corps" and shippedit.
This was the worst blow of all. The colony fairly staggered under it.The Corps was an object-lesson of the moral condition of England outsideof the jails. The colonists trembled. It was feared that next therewould be an importation of the nobility.
In those early days the colony was non-supporting. All the necessariesof life--food, clothing, and all--were sent out from England, and kept ingreat government store-houses, and given to the convicts and sold to thesettlers--sold at a trifling advance upon cost. The Corps saw itsopportunity. Its officers went into commerce, and in a most lawless way.They went to importing rum, and also to manufacturing it in privatestills, in defiance of the government's commands and protests. Theyleagued themselves together and ruled the market; they boycotted thegovernment and the other dealers; they established a close monopoly andkept it strictly in their own hands. When a vessel arrived with spirits,they allowed nobody to buy but themselves, and they forced the owner tosell to them at a price named by themselves--and it was always lowenough. They bought rum at an average of two dollars a gallon and soldit at an average of ten. They made rum the currency of the country--forthere was little or no money--and they maintained their devastating holdand kept the colony under their heel for eighteen or twenty years beforethey were finally conquered and routed by the government.
Meantime, they had spread intemperance everywhere. And they had squeezedfarm after farm out of the settlers hands for rum, and thus hadbountifully enriched themselves. When a farmer was caught in the lastagonies of thirst they took advantage of him and sweated him for a drink.In one instance they sold a man a gallon of rum worth two dollars for apiece of property which was sold some years later for $100,000.When the colony was about eighteen or twenty years old it was discoveredthat the land was specially fitted for the wool-culture. Prosperityfollowed, commerce with the world began, by and by rich mines of thenoble metals were opened, immigrants flowed in, capital likewise. Theresult is the great and wealthy and enlightened commonwealth of New SouthWales.
It is a country that is rich in mines, wool ranches, trams, railways,steamship lines, schools, newspapers, botanical gardens, art galleries,libraries, museums, hospitals, learned societies; it is the hospitablehome of every species of culture and of every species of materialenterprise, and there is a church at every man's door, and a race-trackover the way.
