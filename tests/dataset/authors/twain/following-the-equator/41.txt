There is an old-time toast which is golden for its beauty."When you ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend." --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

The next picture that drifts across the field of my memory is one whichis connected with religious things.  We were taken by friends to see aJain temple.  It was small, and had many flags or streamers flying frompoles standing above its roof; and its little battlements supported agreat many small idols or images.  Upstairs, inside, a solitary Jain waspraying or reciting aloud in the middle of the room.  Our presence didnot interrupt him, nor even incommode him or modify his fervor.  Ten ortwelve feet in front of him was the idol, a small figure in a sittingposture.  It had the pinkish look of a wax doll, but lacked the doll'sroundness of limb and approximation to correctness of form and justnessof proportion.  Mr. Gandhi explained every thing to us.  He was delegateto the Chicago Fair Congress of Religions.  It was lucidly done, inmasterly English, but in time it faded from me, and now I have nothingleft of that episode but an impression: a dim idea of a religious beliefclothed in subtle intellectual forms, lofty and clean, barren of fleshlygrossnesses; and with this another dim impression which connects thatintellectual system somehow with that crude image, that inadequate idol--how, I do not know. Properly they do not seem to belong together.Apparently the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint or a godthrough accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired through aseries of reincarnations and promotions extending over many ages; and wasnow at last a saint and qualified to vicariously receive worship andtransmit it to heaven's chancellery.  Was that it?
And thence we went to Mr. Premchand Roychand's bungalow, in Lovelane,Byculla, where an Indian prince was to receive a deputation of the Jaincommunity who desired to congratulate him upon a high honor latelyconferred upon him by his sovereign, Victoria, Empress of India.  She hadmade him a knight of the order of the Star of India.  It would seem thateven the grandest Indian prince is glad to add the modest title "Sir" tohis ancient native grandeurs, and is willing to do valuable service towin it.  He will remit taxes liberally, and will spend money freely uponthe betterment of the condition of his subjects, if there is a knighthoodto be gotten by it.  And he will also do good work and a deal of it toget a gun added to the salute allowed him by the British Government.Every year the Empress distributes knighthoods and adds guns for publicservices done by native princes.  The salute of a small prince is threeor four guns; princes of greater consequence have salutes that run higherand higher, gun by gun,--oh, clear away up to eleven; possibly more, butI did not hear of any above eleven-gun princes.  I was told that when afour-gun prince gets a gun added, he is pretty troublesome for a while,till the novelty wears off, for he likes the music, and keeps hunting uppretexts to get himself saluted.  It may be that supremely grand folk,like the Nyzam of Hyderabad and the Gaikwar of Baroda, have more thaneleven guns, but I don't know.
When we arrived at the bungalow, the large hall on the ground floor wasalready about full, and carriages were still flowing into the grounds.The company present made a fine show, an exhibition of human fireworks,so to speak, in the matters of costume and comminglings of brilliantcolor.  The variety of form noticeable in the display of turbans wasremarkable.  We were told that the explanation of this was, that thisJain delegation was drawn from many parts of India, and that each manwore the turban that was in vogue in his own region.  This diversity ofturbans made a beautiful effect.
I could have wished to start a rival exhibition there, of Christian hatsand clothes.  I would have cleared one side of the room of its Indiansplendors and repacked the space with Christians drawn from America,England, and the Colonies, dressed in the hats and habits of now, and oftwenty and forty and fifty years ago.  It would have been a hideousexhibition, a thoroughly devilish spectacle.  Then there would have beenthe added disadvantage of the white complexion.  It is not an unbearablyunpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself, but when it comes intocompetition with masses of brown and black the fact is betrayed that itis endurable only because we are used to it.  Nearly all black and brownskins are beautiful, but a beautiful white skin is rare.  How rare, onemay learn by walking down a street in Paris, New York, or London on aweek-day particularly an unfashionable street--and keeping count of thesatisfactory complexions encountered in the course of a mile.  Where darkcomplexions are massed, they make the whites look bleached-out,unwholesome, and sometimes frankly ghastly.  I could notice this as aboy, down South in the slavery days before the war.  The splendid blacksatin skin of the South African Zulus of Durban seemed to me to come veryclose to perfection.  I can see those Zulus yet--'ricksha athleteswaiting in front of the hotel for custom; handsome and intensely blackcreatures, moderately clothed in loose summer stuffs whose snowywhiteness made the black all the blacker by contrast.  Keeping that groupin my mind, I can compare those complexions with the white ones which arestreaming past this London window now:
     A lady.  Complexion, new parchment.  Another lady.  Complexion, old     parchment.
     Another.  Pink and white, very fine.
     Man.  Grayish skin, with purple areas.
     Man.  Unwholesome fish-belly skin.
     Girl.  Sallow face, sprinkled with freckles.
     Old woman.  Face whitey-gray.
     Young butcher.  Face a general red flush.
     Jaundiced man--mustard yellow.
     Elderly lady.  Colorless skin, with two conspicuous moles.
     Elderly man--a drinker.  Boiled-cauliflower nose in a flabby face     veined with purple crinklings.
     Healthy young gentleman.  Fine fresh complexion.
     Sick young man.  His face a ghastly white.
No end of people whose skins are dull and characterless modifications ofthe tint which we miscall white.  Some of these faces are pimply; someexhibit other signs of diseased blood; some show scars of a tint out of aharmony with the surrounding shades of color.  The white man's complexionmakes no concealments.  It can't.  It seemed to have been designed as acatch-all for everything that can damage it.  Ladies have to paint it,and powder it, and cosmetic it, and diet it with arsenic, and enamel it,and be always enticing it, and persuading it, and pestering it, andfussing at it, to make it beautiful; and they do not succeed.  But theseefforts show what they think of the natural complexion, as distributed.As distributed it needs these helps.  The complexion which they try tocounterfeit is one which nature restricts to the few--to the very few.To ninety-nine persons she gives a bad complexion, to the hundredth agood one.  The hundredth can keep it--how long?  Ten years, perhaps.
The advantage is with the Zulu, I think.  He starts with a beautifulcomplexion, and it will last him through.  And as for the Indian brown--firm, smooth, blemishless, pleasant and restful to the eye, afraid of nocolor, harmonizing with all colors and adding a grace to them all--Ithink there is no sort of chance for the average white complexion againstthat rich and perfect tint.
To return to the bungalow.  The most gorgeous costume present were wornby some children.  They seemed to blaze, so bright were the colors, andso brilliant the jewels strum over the rich materials.  These childrenwere professional nautch-dancers, and looked like girls, but they wereboys, They got up by ones and twos and fours, and danced and sang to anaccompaniment of weird music.  Their posturings and gesturings wereelaborate and graceful, but their voices were stringently raspy andunpleasant, and there was a good deal of monotony about the tune.
By and by there was a burst of shouts and cheers outside and the princewith his train entered in fine dramatic style.  He was a stately man, hewas ideally costumed, and fairly festooned with ropes of gems; some ofthe ropes were of pearls, some were of uncut great emeralds--emeraldsrenowned in Bombay for their quality and value.  Their size wasmarvelous, and enticing to the eye, those rocks.  A boy--a princeling--was with the prince, and he also was a radiant exhibition.
The ceremonies were not tedious.  The prince strode to his throne withthe port and majesty--and the sternness--of a Julius Caesar coming toreceive and receipt for a back-country kingdom and have it over and getout, and no fooling.  There was a throne for the young prince, too, andthe two sat there, side by side, with their officers grouped at eitherhand and most accurately and creditably reproducing the pictures whichone sees in the books--pictures which people in the prince's line ofbusiness have been furnishing ever since Solomon received the Queen ofSheba and showed her his things.  The chief of the Jain delegation readhis paper of congratulations, then pushed it into a beautifully engravedsilver cylinder, which was delivered with ceremony into the prince'shands and at once delivered by him without ceremony into the hands of anofficer.  I will copy the address here.  It is interesting, as showingwhat an Indian prince's subject may have opportunity to thank him for inthese days of modern English rule, as contrasted with what his ancestorwould have given them opportunity to thank him for a century and a halfago--the days of freedom unhampered by English interference.  A centuryand a half ago an address of thanks could have been put into small space.It would have thanked the prince--
     1.  For not slaughtering too many of his people upon mere caprice;
     2.  For not stripping them bare by sudden and arbitrary tax levies,     and bringing famine upon them;
     3.  For not upon empty pretext destroying the rich and seizing their     property;
     4.  For not killing, blinding, imprisoning, or banishing the     relatives of the royal house to protect the throne from possible     plots;
     5.  For not betraying the subject secretly, for a bribe, into the     hands of bands of professional Thugs, to be murdered and robbed in     the prince's back lot.
Those were rather common princely industries in the old times, but theyand some others of a harsh sort ceased long ago under English rule.Better industries have taken their place, as this Address from the Jaincommunity will show:
     "Your Highness,--We the undersigned members of the Jain community of     Bombay have the pleasure to approach your Highness with the     expression of our heartfelt congratulations on the recent conference     on your Highness of the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the     Star of India.  Ten years ago we had the pleasure and privilege of     welcoming your Highness to this city under circumstances which have     made a memorable epoch in the history of your State, for had it not     been for a generous and reasonable spirit that your Highness     displayed in the negotiations between the Palitana Durbar and the     Jain community, the conciliatory spirit that animated our people     could not have borne fruit.  That was the first step in your     Highness's administration, and it fitly elicited the praise of the     Jain community, and of the Bombay Government.  A decade of your     Highness's administration, combined with the abilities, training,     and acquirements that your Highness brought to bear upon it, has     justly earned for your Highness the unique and honourable     distinction--the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of     India, which we understand your Highness is the first to enjoy among     Chiefs of your, Highness's rank and standing.  And we assure your     Highness that for this mark of honour that has been conferred on you     by Her Most Gracious Majesty, the Queen-Empress, we feel no less     proud than your Highness.  Establishment of commercial factories,     schools, hospitals, etc., by your Highness in your State has marked     your Highness's career during these ten years, and we trust that     your Highness will be spared to rule over your people with wisdom     and foresight, and foster the many reforms that your Highness has     been pleased to introduce in your State.  We again offer your     Highness our warmest felicitations for the honour that has been     conferred on you.  We beg to remain your Highness's obedient     servants."
Factories, schools, hospitals, reforms.  The prince propagates that kindof things in the modern times, and gets knighthood and guns for it.
After the address the prince responded with snap and brevity; spoke amoment with half a dozen guests in English, and with an official or twoin a native tongue; then the garlands were distributed as usual, and thefunction ended.
