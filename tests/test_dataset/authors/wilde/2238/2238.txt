Tread lightly, she is nearUnder the snow,Speak gently, she can hearThe daisies grow.
All her bright golden hairTarnished with rust,She that was young and fairFallen to dust.
Lily-like, white as snow,She hardly knewShe was a woman, soSweetly she grew.
Coffin-board, heavy stone,Lie on her breast,I vex my heart alone,She is at rest.
Peace, Peace, she cannot hearLyre or sonnet,All my life's buried here,Heap earth upon it.
AVIGNON
