He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair waslong and tangled and greasy, and hung down, and youcould see his eyes shining through like he was behindvines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long,mixed-up whiskers. There warn't no color in his face,where his face showed; it was white; not like anotherman's white, but a white to make a body sick, a whiteto make a body's flesh crawl -- a tree-toad white, afish-belly white. As for his clothes -- just rags, thatwas all. He had one ankle resting on t'other knee;the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toesstuck through, and he worked them now and then.His hat was laying on the floor -- an old black slouchwith the top caved in, like a lid.
I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking atme, with his chair tilted back a little. I set the candledown. I noticed the window was up; so he had clumbin by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. Byand by he says:
"Starchy clothes -- very. You think you're a gooddeal of a big-bug, DON'T you?"
"Maybe I am, maybe I ain't," I says.
"Don't you give me none o' your lip," says he."You've put on considerable many frills since I beenaway. I'll take you down a peg before I get donewith you. You're educated, too, they say -- can readand write. You think you're better'n your father,now, don't you, because he can't? I'LL take it out ofyou. Who told you you might meddle with suchhifalut'n foolishness, hey? -- who told you you could?"
"The widow. She told me."
"The widow, hey? -- and who told the widow shecould put in her shovel about a thing that ain't none ofher business?"
"Nobody never told her."
"Well, I'll learn her how to meddle. And lookyhere -- you drop that school, you hear? I'll learnpeople to bring up a boy to put on airs over his ownfather and let on to be better'n what HE is. You lemmecatch you fooling around that school again, you hear?Your mother couldn't read, and she couldn't write,nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn'tbefore THEY died. I can't; and here you're a-swellingyourself up like this. I ain't the man to stand it --you hear? Say, lemme hear you read."
I took up a book and begun something about Gen-eral Washington and the wars. When I'd read abouta half a minute, he fetched the book a whack with hishand and knocked it across the house. He says:
"It's so. You can do it. I had my doubts whenyou told me. Now looky here; you stop that puttingon frills. I won't have it. I'll lay for you, mysmarty; and if I catch you about that school I'll tanyou good. First you know you'll get religion, too. Inever see such a son.
He took up a little blue and yaller picture of somecows and a boy, and says:
"What's this?"
"It's something they give me for learning mylessons good."
He tore it up, and says:
"I'll give you something better -- I'll give you acowhide.
He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute,and then he says:
"AIN'T you a sweet-scented dandy, though? Abed; and bedclothes; and a look'n'-glass; and a pieceof carpet on the floor -- and your own father got tosleep with the hogs in the tanyard. I never see such ason. I bet I'll take some o' these frills out o' youbefore I'm done with you. Why, there ain't no end toyour airs -- they say you're rich. Hey? -- how's that?"
"They lie -- that's how."
"Looky here -- mind how you talk to me; I'm a-standing about all I can stand now -- so don't gimmeno sass. I've been in town two days, and I hain'theard nothing but about you bein' rich. I heardabout it away down the river, too. That's why Icome. You git me that money to-morrow -- I wantit."
"I hain't got no money."
"It's a lie. Judge Thatcher's got it. You git it.I want it."
"I hain't got no money, I tell you. You ask JudgeThatcher; he'll tell you the same."
"All right. I'll ask him; and I'll make him pungle,too, or I'll know the reason why. Say, how muchyou got in your pocket? I want it."
"I hain't got only a dollar, and I want that to --"
"It don't make no difference what you want it for-- you just shell it out."
He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and thenhe said he was going down town to get some whisky;said he hadn't had a drink all day. When he had gotout on the shed he put his head in again, and cussedme for putting on frills and trying to be better thanhim; and when I reckoned he was gone he come backand put his head in again, and told me to mind aboutthat school, because he was going to lay for me andlick me if I didn't drop that.
Next day he was drunk, and he went to JudgeThatcher's and bullyragged him, and tried to makehim give up the money; but he couldn't, and then heswore he'd make the law force him.
The judge and the widow went to law to get thecourt to take me away from him and let one of thembe my guardian; but it was a new judge that had justcome, and he didn't know the old man; so he saidcourts mustn't interfere and separate families if theycould help it; said he'd druther not take a child awayfrom its father. So Judge Thatcher and the widowhad to quit on the business.
That pleased the old man till he couldn't rest. Hesaid he'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if Ididn't raise some money for him. I borrowed threedollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took it and gotdrunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing andwhooping and carrying on; and he kept it up all overtown, with a tin pan, till most midnight; then theyjailed him, and next day they had him before court,and jailed him again for a week. But he said HE wassatisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he'd makeit warm for HIM.
When he got out the new judge said he was a-goingto make a man of him. So he took him to hisown house, and dressed him up clean and nice, andhad him to breakfast and dinner and supper with thefamily, and was just old pie to him, so to speak. Andafter supper he talked to him about temperance andsuch things till the old man cried, and said he'd been afool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-goingto turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn'tbe ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would helphim and not look down on him. The judge said hecould hug him for them words; so he cried, and hiswife she cried again; pap said he'd been a man that hadalways been misunderstood before, and the judge saidhe believed it. The old man said that what a manwanted that was down was sympathy, and the judgesaid it was so; so they cried again. And when it wasbedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand,and says:
"Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-holdof it; shake it. There's a hand that was the hand ofa hog; but it ain't so no more; it's the hand of a manthat's started in on a new life, and'll die before he'llgo back. You mark them words -- don't forget I saidthem. It's a clean hand now; shake it -- don't beafeard."
So they shook it, one after the other, all around, andcried. The judge's wife she kissed it. Then the oldman he signed a pledge -- made his mark. The judgesaid it was the holiest time on record, or somethinglike that. Then they tucked the old man into a beauti-ful room, which was the spare room, and in the nightsome time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on tothe porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded hisnew coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back againand had a good old time; and towards daylight hecrawled out again, drunk as a fiddler, and rolled offthe porch and broke his left arm in two places, andwas most froze to death when somebody found himafter sun-up. And when they come to look at thatspare room they had to take soundings before theycould navigate it.
The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoneda body could reform the old man with a shotgun,maybe, but he didn't know no other way.
