"Who dah?"
He listened some more; then he come tiptoeingdown and stood right between us; we could a touchedhim, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and minutesthat there warn't a sound, and we all there so closetogether. There was a place on my ankle that got toitching, but I dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begunto itch; and next my back, right between my shoul-ders. Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch. Well,I've noticed that thing plenty times since. If you arewith the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go tosleep when you ain't sleepy -- if you are anywhereswhere it won't do for you to scratch, why you will itchall over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soonJim says:
"Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my catsef I didn' hear sumf'n. Well, I know what I's gwyneto do: I's gwyne to set down here and listen tell Ihears it agin."
So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.He leaned his back up against a tree, and stretched hislegs out till one of them most touched one of mine.My nose begun to itch. It itched till the tears comeinto my eyes. But I dasn't scratch. Then it begunto itch on the inside. Next I got to itching under-neath. I didn't know how I was going to set still.This miserableness went on as much as six or sevenminutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that. Iwas itching in eleven different places now. I reckonedI couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer, but I setmy teeth hard and got ready to try. Just then Jimbegun to breathe heavy; next he begun to snore --and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.
Tom he made a sign to me -- kind of a little noisewith his mouth -- and we went creeping away on ourhands and knees. When we was ten foot off Tomwhispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree forfun. But I said no; he might wake and make a dis-turbance, and then they'd find out I warn't in. ThenTom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he wouldslip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn't wanthim to try. I said Jim might wake up and come.But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and gotthree candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table forpay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to getaway; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawlto where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and playsomething on him. I waited, and it seemed a goodwhile, everything was so still and lonesome.
As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path,around the garden fence, and by and by fetched up onthe steep top of the hill the other side of the house.Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hungit on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, buthe didn't wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be-witched him and put him in a trance, and rode him allover the State, and then set him under the trees again,and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. Andnext time Jim told it he said they rode him down toNew Orleans; and, after that, every time he told it hespread it more and more, till by and by he said theyrode him all over the world, and tired him most todeath, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jimwas monstrous proud about it, and he got so hewouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggerswould come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he wasmore looked up to than any nigger in that country.Strange niggers would stand with their mouths openand look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark bythe kitchen fire; but whenever one was talking andletting on to know all about such things, Jim wouldhappen in and say, "Hm! What you know 'boutwitches?" and that nigger was corked up and had totake a back seat. Jim always kept that five-centerpiece round his neck with a string, and said it was acharm the devil give to him with his own hands, andtold him he could cure anybody with it and fetchwitches whenever he wanted to just by saying some-thing to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.Niggers would come from all around there and giveJim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch it, because thedevil had had his hands on it. Jim was most ruinedfor a servant, because he got stuck up on account ofhaving seen the devil and been rode by witches.
Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hill-top we looked away down into the village and couldsee three or four lights twinkling, where there was sickfolks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling everso fine; and down by the village was the river, a wholemile broad, and awful still and grand. We went downthe hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers, andtwo or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river twomile and a half, to the big scar on the hillside, andwent ashore.
We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom madeeverybody swear to keep the secret, and then showedthem a hole in the hill, right in the thickest part of thebushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in onour hands and knees. We went about two hundredyards, and then the cave opened up. Tom pokedabout amongst the passages, and pretty soon duckedunder a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that therewas a hole. We went along a narrow place and gotinto a kind of room, all damp and sweaty and cold,and there we stopped. Tom says:
"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call itTom Sawyer's Gang. Everybody that wants to joinhas got to take an oath, and write his name in blood."
Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet ofpaper that he had wrote the oath on, and read it. Itswore every boy to stick to the band, and never tellany of the secrets; and if anybody done anything toany boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered tokill that person and his family must do it, and hemustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed themand hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the signof the band. And nobody that didn't belong to theband could use that mark, and if he did he must besued; and if he done it again he must be killed. Andif anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets,he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcassburnt up and the ashes scattered all around, and hisname blotted off of the list with blood and never men-tioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on itand be forgot forever.
Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, andasked Tom if he got it out of his own head. He said,some of it, but the rest was out of pirate-books androbber-books, and every gang that was high-tonedhad it.
Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIESof boys that told the secrets. Tom said it was a goodidea, so he took a pencil and wrote it in. Then BenRogers says:
"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; whatyou going to do 'bout him?"
"Well, hain't he got a father?" says Tom Sawyer.
"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never findhim these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogsin the tanyard, but he hain't been seen in these partsfor a year or more."
They talked it over, and they was going to rule meout, because they said every boy must have a familyor somebody to kill, or else it wouldn't be fair andsquare for the others. Well, nobody could think ofanything to do -- everybody was stumped, and setstill. I was most ready to cry; but all at once Ithought of a way, and so I offered them Miss Watson-- they could kill her. Everybody said:
"Oh, she'll do. That's all right. Huck can comein."
Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to getblood to sign with, and I made my mark on the paper.
"Now," says Ben Rogers, "what's the line of busi-ness of this Gang?"
"Nothing only robbery and murder," Tom said.
"But who are we going to rob? -- houses, or cattle,or --"
"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't rob-bery; it's burglary," says Tom Sawyer. "We ain'tburglars. That ain't no sort of style. We are high-waymen. We stop stages and carriages on the road,with masks on, and kill the people and take theirwatches and money."
"Must we always kill the people?"
"Oh, certainly. It's best. Some authorities thinkdifferent, but mostly it's considered best to kill them --except some that you bring to the cave here, and keepthem till they're ransomed."
"Ransomed? What's that?"
"I don't know. But that's what they do. I'veseen it in books; and so of course that's what we'vegot to do."
"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?"
"Why, blame it all, we've GOT to do it. Don't I tellyou it's in the books? Do you want to go to doingdifferent from what's in the books, and get things allmuddled up?"
"Oh, that's all very fine to SAY, Tom Sawyer, buthow in the nation are these fellows going to be ran-somed if we don't know how to do it to them? -- that'sthe thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckonit is?"
"Well, I don't know. But per'aps if we keep themtill they're ransomed, it means that we keep them tillthey're dead. "
"Now, that's something LIKE. That'll answer.Why couldn't you said that before? We'll keep themtill they're ransomed to death; and a bothersome lotthey'll be, too -- eating up everything, and alwaystrying to get loose."
"How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they getloose when there's a guard over them, ready to shootthem down if they move a peg?"
"A guard! Well, that IS good. So somebody'sgot to set up all night and never get any sleep, just soas to watch them. I think that's foolishness. Whycan't a body take a club and ransom them as soon asthey get here?"
"Because it ain't in the books so -- that's why.Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular,or don't you? -- that's the idea. Don't you reckonthat the people that made the books knows what's thecorrect thing to do? Do you reckon YOU can learn'em anything? Not by a good deal. No, sir, we'lljust go on and ransom them in the regular way."
"All right. I don't mind; but I say it's a foolway, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?"
"Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you Iwouldn't let on. Kill the women? No; nobody eversaw anything in the books like that. You fetch themto the cave, and you're always as polite as pie to them;and by and by they fall in love with you, and neverwant to go home any more."
"Well, if that's the way I'm agreed, but I don'ttake no stock in it. Mighty soon we'll have the caveso cluttered up with women, and fellows waiting to beransomed, that there won't be no place for the rob-bers. But go ahead, I ain't got nothing to say."
Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and whenthey waked him up he was scared, and cried, and saidhe wanted to go home to his ma, and didn't want tobe a robber any more.
So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him mad, and he said he wouldgo straight and tell all the secrets. But Tom give himfive cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go homeand meet next week, and rob somebody and kill somepeople.
Ben Rogers said he couldn't get out much, onlySundays, and so he wanted to begin next Sunday; butall the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday,and that settled the thing. They agreed to get to-gether and fix a day as soon as they could, and thenwe elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harpersecond captain of the Gang, and so started home.
I clumb up the shed and crept into my window justbefore day was breaking. My new clothes was allgreased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.
