  I wonder if with you, as it is with me,	If under your slipping words, that easily flow	About you as a garment, easily,	 Your violent heart beats to and fro!	 Long have I waited, never once confessed, Even to myself, how bitter the separation;	Now, being come again, how make the best	 Reparation?	 If I could cast this clothing off from me,	If I could lift my naked self to you, Of if only you would repulse me, a wound would be	 Good; it would let the ache come through.	 But that you hold me still so kindly cold	Aloof my floating heart will not allow;	Yea, but I loathe you that you should withhold  Your pleasure now.
