At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so Icould stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired Iplayed hookey, and the hiding I got next day done megood and cheered me up. So the longer I went toschool the easier it got to be. I was getting sort ofused to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't soraspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in a bedpulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the coldweather I used to slide out and sleep in the woodssometimes, and so that was a rest to me. I liked theold ways best, but I was getting so I liked the newones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was comingalong slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. Shesaid she warn't ashamed of me.
One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellarat breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as Icould to throw over my left shoulder and keep off thebad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, andcrossed me off. She says, "Take your hands away,Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!"The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn'tgoing to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that wellenough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worriedand shaky, and wondering where it was going to fallon me, and what it was going to be. There is ways tokeep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't oneof them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but justpoked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.
I went down to the front garden and clumb over thestile where you go through the high board fence.There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and Iseen somebody's tracks. They had come up from thequarry and stood around the stile a while, and thenwent on around the garden fence. It was funny theyhadn't come in, after standing around so. I couldn'tmake it out. It was very curious, somehow. I wasgoing to follow around, but I stooped down to look atthe tracks first. I didn't notice anything at first, butnext I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heelmade with big nails, to keep off the devil.
I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. Ilooked over my shoulder every now and then, but Ididn't see nobody. I was at Judge Thatcher's as quickas I could get there. He said:
"Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Didyou come for your interest?"
"No, sir," I says; "is there some for me?"
"Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night -- over ahundred and fifty dollars. Quite a fortune for you.You had better let me invest it along with your sixthousand, because if you take it you'll spend it."
"No, sir," I says, "I don't want to spend it. Idon't want it at all -- nor the six thousand, nuther.I want you to take it; I want to give it to you -- thesix thousand and all."
He looked surprised. He couldn't seem to makeit out. He says:
"Why, what can you mean, my boy?"
I says, "Don't you ask me no questions about it,please. You'll take it -- won't you?"
He says:
"Well, I'm puzzled. Is something the matter?"
"Please take it," says I, "and don't ask me noth-ing -- then I won't have to tell no lies."
He studied a while, and then he says:
"Oho-o! I think I see. You want to SELL all yourproperty to me -- not give it. That's the correctidea."
Then he wrote something on a paper and read itover, and says:
"There; you see it says 'for a consideration.' Thatmeans I have bought it of you and paid you for it.Here's a dollar for you. Now you sign it."
So I signed it, and left.
Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big asyour fist, which had been took out of the fourthstomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it.He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowedeverything. So I went to him that night and told himpap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow.What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do,and was he going to stay? Jim got out his hair-balland said something over it, and then he held it up anddropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and onlyrolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and thenanother time, and it acted just the same. Jim gotdown on his knees, and put his ear against it andlistened. But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn'ttalk. He said sometimes it wouldn't talk withoutmoney. I told him I had an old slick counterfeitquarter that warn't no good because the brass showedthrough the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow,even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slickit felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time.(I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar Igot from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money,but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybeit wouldn't know the difference. Jim smelt it and bitit and rubbed it, and said he would manage so thehair-ball would think it was good. He said he wouldsplit open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter inbetween and keep it there all night, and next morningyou couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasyno more, and so anybody in town would take it in aminute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potatowould do that before, but I had forgot it.
Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and gotdown and listened again. This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it would tell my wholefortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says:
"Yo' ole father doan' know yit what he's a-gwyneto do. Sometimes he spec he'll go 'way, en den aginhe spec he'll stay. De bes' way is to res' easy en letde ole man take his own way. Dey's two angelshoverin' roun' 'bout him. One uv 'em is white enshiny, en t'other one is black. De white one gits himto go right a little while, den de black one sail in enbust it all up. A body can't tell yit which one gwyneto fetch him at de las'. But you is all right. Yougwyne to have considable trouble in yo' life, en con-sidable joy. Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt, ensometimes you gwyne to git sick; but every time you'sgwyne to git well agin. Dey's two gals flyin' 'boutyou in yo' life. One uv 'em's light en t'other one isdark. One is rich en t'other is po'. You's gwyne tomarry de po' one fust en de rich one by en by. Youwants to keep 'way fum de water as much as you kin,en don't run no resk, 'kase it's down in de bills datyou's gwyne to git hung."
When I lit my candle and went up to my room thatnight there sat pap -- his own self!
