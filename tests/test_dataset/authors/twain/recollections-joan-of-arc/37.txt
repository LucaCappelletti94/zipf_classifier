Fierce Talbot Reconsiders
I KNEW she had seen the wisdom of the Tree. But when? I could not know.Doubtless before she had lately told the King to use her, for that shehad but one year left to work in. It had not occurred to me at the time,but the conviction came upon me now that at that time she had alreadyseen the Tree. It had brought her a welcome message; that was plain,otherwise she could not have been so joyous and light-hearted as she hadbeen these latter days. The death-warning had nothing dismal about it forher; no, it was remission of exile, it was leave to come home.
Yes, she had seen the Tree. No one had taken the prophecy to heart whichshe made to the King; and for a good reason, no doubt; no one wanted totake it to heart; all wanted to banish it away and forget it. And all hadsucceeded, and would go on to the end placid and comfortable. All but mealone. I must carry my awful secret without any to help me. A heavy load,a bitter burden; and would cost me a daily heartbreak. She was to die;and so soon. I had never dreamed of that. How could I, and she so strongand fresh and young, and every day earning a new right to a peaceful andhonored old age? For at that time I though old age valuable. I do notknow why, but I thought so. All young people think it, I believe, theybeing ignorant and full of superstitions. She had seen the Tree. All thatmiserable night those ancient verses went floating back and forth throughmy brain:
 And when, in exile wand'ring, we Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee, Oh, rise upon our sight!
But at dawn the bugles and the drums burst through the dreamy hush of themorning, and it was turn out all! mount and ride. For there was red workto be done.
We marched to Meung without halting. There we carried the bridge byassault, and left a force to hold it, the rest of the army marching awaynext morning toward Beaugency, where the lion Talbot, the terror of theFrench, was in command. When we arrived at that place, the Englishretired into the castle and we sat down in the abandoned town.
Talbot was not at the moment present in person, for he had gone away towatch for and welcome Fastolfe and his reinforcement of five thousandmen.
Joan placed her batteries and bombarded the castle till night. Then somenews came: Richemont, Constable of France, this long time in disgracewith the King, largely because of the evil machinations of La Tremouilleand his party, was approaching with a large body of men to offer hisservices to Joan--and very much she needed them, now that Fastolfe was soclose by. Richemont had wanted to join us before, when we first marchedon Orleans; but the foolish King, slave of those paltry advisers of his,warned him to keep his distance and refused all reconciliation with him.
I go into these details because they are important. Important becausethey lead up to the exhibition of a new gift in Joan's extraordinarymental make-up--statesmanship. It is a sufficiently strange thing to findthat great quality in an ignorant country-girl of seventeen and a half,but she had it.
Joan was for receiving Richemont cordially, and so was La Hire and thetwo young Lavals and other chiefs, but the Lieutenant-General, d'Alencon,strenuously and stubbornly opposed it. He said he had absolute ordersfrom the King to deny and defy Richemont, and that if they wereoverridden he would leave the army. This would have been a heavydisaster, indeed. But Joan set herself the task of persuading him thatthe salvation of France took precedence of all minor things--even thecommands of a sceptered ass; and she accomplished it. She persuaded himto disobey the King in the interest of the nation, and to be reconciledto Count Richemont and welcome him. That was statesmanship; and of thehighest and soundest sort. Whatever thing men call great, look for it inJoan of Arc, and there you will find it.
In the early morning, June 17th, the scouts reported the approach ofTalbot and Fastolfe with Fastolfe's succoring force. Then the drums beatto arms; and we set forth to meet the English, leaving Richemont and histroops behind to watch the castle of Beaugency and keep its garrison athome. By and by we came in sight of the enemy. Fastolfe had tried toconvince Talbot that it would be wisest to retreat and not risk a battlewith Joan at this time, but distribute the new levies among the Englishstrongholds of the Loire, thus securing them against capture; then bepatient and wait--wait for more levies from Paris; let Joan exhaust herarmy with fruitless daily skirmishing; then at the right time fall uponher in resistless mass and annihilate her. He was a wise old experiencedgeneral, was Fastolfe. But that fierce Talbot would hear of no delay. Hewas in a rage over the punishment which the Maid had inflicted upon himat Orleans and since, and he swore by God and Saint George that he wouldhave it out with her if he had to fight her all alone. So Fastolfeyielded, though he said they were now risking the loss of everythingwhich the English had gained by so many years' work and so many hardknocks.
The enemy had taken up a strong position, and were waiting, in order ofbattle, with their archers to the front and a stockade before them.
Night was coming on. A messenger came from the English with a rudedefiance and an offer of battle. But Joan's dignity was not ruffled, herbearing was not discomposed. She said to the herald:
"Go back and say it is too late to meet to-night; but to-morrow, pleaseGod and our Lady, we will come to close quarters."
The night fell dark and rainy. It was that sort of light steady rainwhich falls so softly and brings to one's spirit such serenity and peace.About ten o'clock D'Alencon, the Bastard of Orleans, La Hire, Pothon ofSaintrailles, and two or three other generals came to our headquarterstent, and sat down to discuss matters with Joan. Some thought it was apity that Joan had declined battle, some thought not. Then Pothon askedher why she had declined it. She said:
"There was more than one reason. These English are ours--they cannot getaway from us. Wherefore there is no need to take risks, as at othertimes. The day was far spent. It is good to have much time and the fairlight of day when one's force is in a weakened state--nine hundred of usyonder keeping the bridge of Meung under the Marshal de Rais, fifteenhundred with the Constable of France keeping the bridge and watching thecastle of Beaugency."
Dunois said:
"I grieve for this decision, Excellency, but it cannot be helped. And thecase will be the same the morrow, as to that."
Joan was walking up and down just then. She laughed her affectionate,comrady laugh, and stopping before that old war-tiger she put her smallhand above his head and touched one of his plumes, saying:
"Now tell me, wise man, which feather is it that I touch?"
"In sooth, Excellency, that I cannot."
"Name of God, Bastard, Bastard! you cannot tell me this small thing, yetare bold to name a large one--telling us what is in the stomach of theunborn morrow: that we shall not have those men. Now it is my thoughtthat they will be with us."
That made a stir. All wanted to know why she thought that. But La Hiretook the word and said:
"Let be. If she thinks it, that is enough. It will happen."
Then Pothon of Santrailles said:
"There were other reasons for declining battle, according to the sayingof your Excellency?"
"Yes. One was that we being weak and the day far gone, the battle mightnot be decisive. When it is fought it must be decisive. And it shall be."
"God grant it, and amen. There were still other reasons?"
"One other--yes." She hesitated a moment, then said: "This was not theday. To-morrow is the day. It is so written."
They were going to assail her with eager questionings, but she put up herhand and prevented them. Then she said:
"It will be the most noble and beneficent victory that God has vouchsafedfor France at any time. I pray you question me not as to whence or how Iknow this thing, but be content that it is so."
There was pleasure in every face, and conviction and high confidence. Amurmur of conversation broke out, but that was interrupted by a messengerfrom the outposts who brought news--namely, that for an hour there hadbeen stir and movement in the English camp of a sort unusual at such atime and with a resting army, he said. Spies had been sent under cover ofthe rain and darkness to inquire into it. They had just come back andreported that large bodies of men had been dimly made out who wereslipping stealthily away in the direction of Meung.
The generals were very much surprised, as any might tell from theirfaces.
"It is a retreat," said Joan.
"It has that look," said D'Alencon.
"It certainly has," observed the Bastard and La Hire.
"It was not to be expected," said Louis de Bourbon, "but one can divinethe purpose of it."
"Yes," responded Joan. "Talbot has reflected. His rash brain has cooled.He thinks to take the bridge of Meung and escape to the other side of theriver. He knows that this leaves his garrison of Beaugency at the mercyof fortune, to escape our hands if it can; but there is no other courseif he would avoid this battle, and that he also knows. But he shall notget the bridge. We will see to that."
"Yes," said D'Alencon, "we must follow him, and take care of that matter.What of Beaugency?"
"Leave Beaugency to me, gentle duke; I will have it in two hours, and atno cost of blood."
"It is true, Excellency. You will but need to deliver this news there andreceive the surrender."
"Yes. And I will be with you at Meung with the dawn, fetching theConstable and his fifteen hundred; and when Talbot knows that Beaugencyhas fallen it will have an effect upon him."
"By the mass, yes!" cried La Hire. "He will join his Meung garrison tohis army and break for Paris. Then we shall have our bridge force with usagain, along with our Beaugency watchers, and be stronger for our greatday's work by four-and-twenty hundred able soldiers, as was here promisedwithin the hour. Verily this Englishman is doing our errands for us andsaving us much blood and trouble. Orders, Excellency--give us orders!"
"They are simple. Let the men rest three hours longer. At one o'clock theadvance-guard will march, under our command, with Pothon of Saintraillesas second; the second division will follow at two under theLieutenant-General. Keep well in the rear of the enemy, and see to itthat you avoid an engagement. I will ride under guard to Beaugency andmake so quick work there that Ii and the Constable of France will joinyou before dawn with his men."
She kept her word. Her guard mounted and we rode off through theputtering rain, taking with us a captured English officer to confirmJoan's news. We soon covered the journey and summoned the castle. RichardGuetin, Talbot's lieutenant, being convinced that he and his five hundredmen were left helpless, conceded that it would be useless to try to holdout. He could not expect easy terms, yet Joan granted them nevertheless.His garrison could keep their horses and arms, and carry away property tothe value of a silver mark per man. They could go whither they pleased,but must not take arms against France again under ten days.
Before dawn we were with our army again, and with us the Constable andnearly all his men, for we left only a small garrison in Beaugencycastle. We heard the dull booming of cannon to the front, and knew thatTalbot was beginning his attack on the bridge. But some time before itwas yet light the sound ceased and we heard it no more.
Guetin had sent a messenger through our lines under a safe-conduct givenby Joan, to tell Talbot of the surrender. Of course this poursuivant hadarrived ahead of us. Talbot had held it wisdom to turn now and retreatupon Paris. When daylight came he had disappeared; and with him LordScales and the garrison of Meung.
What a harvest of English strongholds we had reaped in those threedays!--strongholds which had defied France with quite cool confidence andplenty of it until we came.
