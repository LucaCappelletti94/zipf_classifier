In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me fromthe East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, andinquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested todo, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that_Leonidas W_. Smiley is a myth; and that my friend never knew such apersonage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked old Wheelerabout him, it would remind him of his infamous _Jim Smiley_, and hewould go to work and bore me to death with some exasperatingreminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should be useless tome. If that was the design, it succeeded.
I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the barroom stove of thedilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of Angel's, and Inoticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression ofwinning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. Heroused up, and gave me good-day. I told him a friend had commissionedme to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhoodnamed _Leonidas W_. Smiley--_Rev. Leonidas W._ Smiley, a youngminister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident ofAngel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything aboutthis Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations tohim.
Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with hischair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative whichfollows this paragraph. He never smiled, he never frowned, he neverchanged his voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tuned hisinitial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion ofenthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran avein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainlythat, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous orfunny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter,and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in _finesse_.I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.
"Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here onceby the name of _Jim_ Smiley, in the winter of '49--or may be it wasthe spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though whatmakes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the bigflume warn't finished when he first came to the camp; but any way, hewas the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned upyou ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and ifhe couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man wouldsuit _him_--any way just so's he got a bet, _he_ was satisfied. Butstill he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. Hewas always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be nosolit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, andtake any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was ahorse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the endof it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was acat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet onit; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet youwhich one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would bethere reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the bestexhorter about here, and he was, too, and a good man. If he even see astraddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it wouldtake him to get to--to wherever he _was_ going to, and if you took himup, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would findout where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots ofthe boys here has seen that Smiley and can tell you about him. Why, itnever made no difference to _him_--he'd bet on _any_ thing--thedangest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a goodwhile, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but onemorning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and hesaid she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nit'mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'denceshe'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, ï¿½Well, I'llrisk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'"
Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minutenag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of course, she wasfaster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all shewas so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or theconsumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two orthree hundred yards start, and then pass her under way; but always atthe fag-end of the race she'd get excited and desperate-like, and comecavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber,sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side amongst thefences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket withher coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up atthe stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher itdown.
And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think hewarn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for achance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was adifferent dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'-castleof a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like thefurnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him,and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and AndrewJackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never leton but what _he_ was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--andthe bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time,till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab thatother dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--notchaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwedup the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on thatpup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs,because they'd been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thinghad gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come tomake a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he'd beenimposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak,and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like,and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked outbad. He gave Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, andit was _his_ fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs forhim to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, andthen he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup,was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself ifhe'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it,because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand toreason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under themcircumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorrywhen I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.
Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, andtom-cats and all of them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, andyou couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. Heketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated toeducate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set inhis back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he _did_learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the nextminute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--seehim turn one summerset, or may be a couple, if he got a good start,and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up soin the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant,that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smileysaid all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'mostanything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster downhere on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and singout, "Flies, Dan'l, flies!" and quicker'n you could wink he'd springstraight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down onthe floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching theside of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't noidea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see afrog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was sogifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level,he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of hisbreed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, youunderstand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money onhim as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog,and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and beeneverywheres, all said he laid over any frog that ever _they_ see.
Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used tofetch him downtown sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller--astranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:
"What might be that you've got in the box?"
And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, "It might be a parrot, or itmight be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog."
And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it roundthis way and that, and says, "H'm--so 'tis. Well, what's _he_ goodfor?"
"Well," Smiley says, easy and careless, "he's good enough for _one_thing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras county."
The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular look,and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, "Well," hesays, "I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n anyother frog."
"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs and maybeyou don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe youain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got _my_ opinion andI'll risk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in CalaverasCounty."
And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad like,"Well, I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I hada frog, I'd bet you."
And then Smiley says, "That's all right--that's all right--if you'llhold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog." And so the fellertook the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, andset down to wait.
So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to his-self, andthen he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoonand filled him full of quail shot--filled! him pretty near up to hischin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp andslopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched afrog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:
"Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his forepawsjust even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word." Then he says,"One--two--three--_git_!" and him and the feller touched up the frogsfrom behind, and the new frog hopped off lively, but Dan'l give aheave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but itwarn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church,and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was agood deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have noidea what the matter was, of course.
The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going outat the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--atDan'l, and says again, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "_I_ don'tsee no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog."
Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a longtime, and at last says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frogthrowed off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter withhim--he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow." And he ketched Dan'l upby the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, "Why blame my catsif he don't weigh five pounds!" and turned him upside down and hebelched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, andhe was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after thatfeller, but he never ketched him. And----
(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and gotup to see what was wanted.) And turning to me as he moved away, hesaid: "Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't goingto be gone a second."
But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the historyof the enterprising vagabond _Jim_ Smiley would be likely to afford memuch information concerning the Rev. _Leonidas W._ Smiley, and so Istarted away.
At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholedme and recommenced:
"Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller, one-eyed cow that didn't have notail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and----"
However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hearabout the afflicted cow, but took my leave.
