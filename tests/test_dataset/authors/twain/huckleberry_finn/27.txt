The person coming was Mary Jane. She went tothe coffin, very soft, and kneeled down and looked in;then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begunto cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back wasto me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room Ithought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me;so I looked through the crack, and everything was allright. They hadn't stirred.
I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accountsof the thing playing out that way after I had took somuch trouble and run so much resk about it. Says I,if it could stay where it is, all right; because when weget down the river a hundred mile or two I could writeback to Mary Jane, and she could dig him up againand get it; but that ain't the thing that's going tohappen; the thing that's going to happen is, themoney 'll be found when they come to screw on thelid. Then the king 'll get it again, and it 'll be a longday before he gives anybody another chance to smouchit from him. Of course I WANTED to slide down andget it out of there, but I dasn't try it. Every minuteit was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some ofthem watchers would begin to stir, and I might getcatched -- catched with six thousand dollars in myhands that nobody hadn't hired me to take care of. Idon't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that,I says to myself.
When I got down stairs in the morning the parlorwas shut up, and the watchers was gone. There warn'tnobody around but the family and the widow Bartleyand our tribe. I watched their faces to see if anythinghad been happening, but I couldn't tell.
Towards the middle of the day the undertaker comewith his man, and they set the coffin in the middle ofthe room on a couple of chairs, and then set all ourchairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighborstill the hall and the parlor and the dining-room wasfull. I see the coffin lid was the way it was before,but I dasn't go to look in under it, with folks around.
Then the people begun to flock in, and the beatsand the girls took seats in the front row at the head ofthe coffin, and for a half an hour the people filedaround slow, in single rank, and looked down at thedead man's face a minute, and some dropped in a tear,and it was all very still and solemn, only the girls andthe beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keep-ing their heads bent, and sobbing a little. Therewarn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet onthe floor and blowing noses -- because people alwaysblows them more at a funeral than they do at otherplaces except church.
When the place was packed full the undertaker heslid around in his black gloves with his softy soother-ing ways, putting on the last touches, and gettingpeople and things all ship-shape and comfortable, andmaking no more sound than a cat. He never spoke;he moved people around, he squeezed in late ones, heopened up passageways, and done it with nods, andsigns with his hands. Then he took his place overagainst the wall. He was the softest, glidingest,stealthiest man I ever see; and there warn't no moresmile to him than there is to a ham.
They had borrowed a melodeum -- a sick one; andwhen everything was ready a young woman set downand worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and colicky,and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was theonly one that had a good thing, according to mynotion. Then the Reverend Hobson opened up, slowand solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off themost outrageous row busted out in the cellar a bodyever heard; it was only one dog, but he made a mostpowerful racket, and he kept it up right along; theparson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait-- you couldn't hear yourself think. It was rightdown awkward, and nobody didn't seem to know whatto do. But pretty soon they see that long-leggedundertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as tosay, "Don't you worry -- just depend on me." Thenhe stooped down and begun to glide along the wall,just his shoulders showing over the people's heads.So he glided along, and the powwow and racket get-ting more and more outrageous all the time; and atlast, when he had gone around two sides of the room,he disappears down cellar. Then in about two secondswe heard a whack, and the dog he finished up with amost amazing howl or two, and then everything wasdead still, and the parson begun his solemn talk wherehe left off. In a minute or two here comes this under-taker's back and shoulders gliding along the wallagain; and so he glided and glided around three sidesof the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouthwith his hands, and stretched his neck out towards thepreacher, over the people's heads, and says, in a kindof a coarse whisper, "HE HAD A RAT!" Then hedrooped down and glided along the wall again to hisplace. You could see it was a great satisfaction to thepeople, because naturally they wanted to know. Alittle thing like that don't cost nothing, and it's just thelittle things that makes a man to be looked up to andliked. There warn't no more popular man in townthan what that undertaker was.
Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pisonlong and tiresome; and then the king he shoved in andgot off some of his usual rubbage, and at last the jobwas through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up onthe coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweatthen, and watched him pretty keen. But he nevermeddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft as mush,and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was!I didn't know whether the money was in there or not.So, says I, s'pose somebody has hogged that bag onthe sly? -- now how do I know whether to write toMary Jane or not? S'pose she dug him up and didn'tfind nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it,I says, I might get hunted up and jailed; I'd betterlay low and keep dark, and not write at all; the thing'sawful mixed now; trying to better it, I've worsened ita hundred times, and I wish to goodness I'd just let italone, dad fetch the whole business!
They buried him, and we come back home, and Iwent to watching faces again -- I couldn't help it, andI couldn't rest easy. But nothing come of it; thefaces didn't tell me nothing.                                
The king he visited around in the evening, andsweetened everybody up, and made himself ever sofriendly; and he give out the idea that his congrega-tion over in England would be in a sweat about him,so he must hurry and settle up the estate right awayand leave for home. He was very sorry he was sopushed, and so was everybody; they wished he couldstay longer, but they said they could see it couldn't bedone. And he said of course him and William wouldtake the girls home with them; and that pleased every-body too, because then the girls would be well fixed andamongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls,too -- tickled them so they clean forgot they ever hada trouble in the world; and told him to sell out asquick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Thempoor things was that glad and happy it made my heartache to see them getting fooled and lied to so, but Ididn't see no safe way for me to chip in and changethe general tune.
Well, blamed if the king didn't bill the house andthe niggers and all the property for auction straightoff -- sale two days after the funeral; but anybodycould buy private beforehand if they wanted to.
So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls' joy got the first jolt. A couple ofnigger traders come along, and the king sold them theniggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they calledit, and away they went, the two sons up the river toMemphis, and their mother down the river to Orleans.I thought them poor girls and them niggers wouldbreak their hearts for grief; they cried around eachother, and took on so it most made me down sick tosee it. The girls said they hadn't ever dreamed ofseeing the family separated or sold away from thetown. I can't ever get it out of my memory, thesight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hangingaround each other's necks and crying; and I reckon Icouldn't a stood it all, but would a had to bust outand tell on our gang if I hadn't knowed the sale warn'tno account and the niggers would be back home in aweek or two.
The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and agood many come out flatfooted and said it was scandal-ous to separate the mother and the children that way.It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he bulledright along, spite of all the duke could say or do, andI tell you the duke was powerful uneasy.
Next day was auction day. About broad day in themorning the king and the duke come up in the garretand woke me up, and I see by their look that therewas trouble. The king says:
"Was you in my room night before last?"
"No, your majesty" -- which was the way I alwayscalled him when nobody but our gang warn't around.
"Was you in there yisterday er last night?"
"No, your majesty."
"Honor bright, now -- no lies."
"Honor bright, your majesty, I'm telling you thetruth. I hain't been a-near your room since Miss MaryJane took you and the duke and showed it to you."
The duke says:
"Have you seen anybody else go in there?"
"No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe."
"Stop and think."
I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:
"Well, I see the niggers go in there several times."
Both of them gave a little jump, and looked likethey hadn't ever expected it, and then like they HAD.Then the duke says:
"What, all of them?"
"No -- leastways, not all at once -- that is, I don'tthink I ever see them all come OUT at once but just onetime."
"Hello! When was that?"
"It was the day we had the funeral. In the morn-ing. It warn't early, because I overslept. I was juststarting down the ladder, and I see them."
"Well, go on, GO on! What did they do? How'dthey act?"
"They didn't do nothing. And they didn't actanyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away;so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved in there todo up your majesty's room, or something, s'posingyou was up; and found you WARN'T up, and so theywas hoping to slide out of the way of trouble withoutwaking you up, if they hadn't already waked you up."
"Great guns, THIS is a go!" says the king; andboth of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly.They stood there a-thinking and scratching their headsa minute, and the duke he bust into a kind of a littleraspy chuckle, and says:
"It does beat all how neat the niggers played theirhand. They let on to be SORRY they was going out ofthis region! And I believed they WAS sorry, and sodid you, and so did everybody. Don't ever tell MEany more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent.Why, the way they played that thing it would foolANYBODY. In my opinion, there's a fortune in 'em. IfI had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a betterlay-out than that -- and here we've gone and sold 'emfor a song. Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the songyet. Say, where IS that song -- that draft?"
"In the bank for to be collected. Where WOULD itbe?"
"Well, THAT'S all right then, thank goodness."
Says I, kind of timid-like:
"Is something gone wrong?"
The king whirls on me and rips out:
"None o' your business! You keep your headshet, and mind y'r own affairs -- if you got any.Long as you're in this town don't you forgit THAT --you hear?" Then he says to the duke, "We got tojest swaller it and say noth'n': mum's the word for US."
As they was starting down the ladder the duke hechuckles again, and says:
"Quick sales AND small profits! It's a good busi-ness -- yes."
The king snarls around on him and says:
"I was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em outso quick. If the profits has turned out to be none,lackin' considable, and none to carry, is it my faultany more'n it's yourn?"
"Well, THEY'D be in this house yet and we WOULDN'Tif I could a got my advice listened to."
The king sassed back as much as was safe for him,and then swapped around and lit into ME again. Hegive me down the banks for not coming and TELLINGhim I see the niggers come out of his room acting thatway -- said any fool would a KNOWED something wasup. And then waltzed in and cussed HIMSELF awhile,and said it all come of him not laying late and takinghis natural rest that morning, and he'd be blamed if he'dever do it again. So they went off a-jawing; and Ifelt dreadful glad I'd worked it all off on to the niggers,and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it.
