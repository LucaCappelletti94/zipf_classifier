The timid man yearns for full value and asks a tenth. The bold manstrikes for double value and compromises on par. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
One is sure to be struck by the liberal way in which Australasia spendsmoney upon public works--such as legislative buildings, town halls,hospitals, asylums, parks, and botanical gardens. I should say thatwhere minor towns in America spend a hundred dollars on the town hall andon public parks and gardens, the like towns in Australasia spend athousand. And I think that this ratio will hold good in the matter ofhospitals, also. I have seen a costly and well-equipped, andarchitecturally handsome hospital in an Australian village of fifteenhundred inhabitants. It was built by private funds furnished by thevillagers and the neighboring planters, and its running expenses weredrawn from the same sources. I suppose it would be hard to match this inany country. This village was about to close a contract for lighting itsstreets with the electric light, when I was there. That is ahead ofLondon. London is still obscured by gas--gas pretty widely scattered,too, in some of the districts; so widely indeed, that except on moonlightnights it is difficult to find the gas lamps.
The botanical garden of Sydney covers thirty-eight acres, beautifullylaid out and rich with the spoil of all the lands and all the climes ofthe world. The garden is on high ground in the middle of the town,overlooking the great harbor, and it adjoins the spacious grounds ofGovernment House--fifty-six acres; and at hand also, is a recreationground containing eighty-two acres. In addition, there are thezoological gardens, the race-course, and the great cricket-grounds wherethe international matches are played. Therefore there is plenty of roomfor reposeful lazying and lounging, and for exercise too, for such aslike that kind of work.
There are four specialties attainable in the way of social pleasure. Ifyou enter your name on the Visitor's Book at Government House you willreceive an invitation to the next ball that takes place there, if nothingcan be proven against you. And it will be very pleasant; for you willsee everybody except the Governor, and add a number of acquaintances andseveral friends to your list. The Governor will be in England. Healways is. The continent has four or five governors, and I do not knowhow many it takes to govern the outlying archipelago; but anyway you willnot see them. When they are appointed they come out from England and getinaugurated, and give a ball, and help pray for rain, and get aboard shipand go back home. And so the Lieutenant-Governor has to do all the work.I was in Australasia three months and a half, and saw only one Governor.The others were at home.
The Australasian Governor would not be so restless, perhaps, if he had awar, or a veto, or something like that to call for his reserve-energies,but he hasn't. There isn't any war, and there isn't any veto in hishands. And so there is really little or nothing doing in his line. Thecountry governs itself, and prefers to do it; and is so strenuous aboutit and so jealous of its independence that it grows restive if even theImperial Government at home proposes to help; and so the Imperial veto,while a fact, is yet mainly a name.
Thus the Governor's functions are much more limited than are a Governor'sfunctions with us. And therefore more fatiguing. He is the apparenthead of the State, he is the real head of Society. He representsculture, refinement, elevated sentiment, polite life, religion; and byhis example he propagates these, and they spread and flourish and beargood fruit. He creates the fashion, and leads it. His ball is the ballof balls, and his countenance makes the horse-race thrive.
He is usually a lord, and this is well; for his position compels him tolead an expensive life, and an English lord is generally well equippedfor that.
Another of Sydney's social pleasures is the visit to the Admiralty House;which is nobly situated on high ground overlooking the water. The trimboats of the service convey the guests thither; and there, or on boardthe flag-ship, they have the duplicate of the hospitalities of GovernmentHouse. The Admiral commanding a station in British waters is a magnateof the first degree, and he is sumptuously housed, as becomes the dignityof his office.
Third in the list of special pleasures is the tour of the harbor in afine steam pleasure-launch. Your richer friends own boats of this kind,and they will invite you, and the joys of the trip will make a long dayseem short.
And finally comes the shark-fishing. Sydney Harbor is populous with thefinest breeds of man-eating sharks in the world. Some people make theirliving catching them; for the Government pays a cash bounty on them. Thelarger the shark the larger the bounty, and some of the sharks are twentyfeet long. You not only get the bounty, but everything that is in theshark belongs to you. Sometimes the contents are quite valuable.
The shark is the swiftest fish that swims. The speed of the fasteststeamer afloat is poor compared to his. And he is a great gad-about, androams far and wide in the oceans, and visits the shores of all of them,ultimately, in the course of his restless excursions. I have a tale totell now, which has not as yet been in print. In 1870 a young strangerarrived in Sydney, and set about finding something to do; but he knew noone, and brought no recommendations, and the result was that he got noemployment. He had aimed high, at first, but as time and his moneywasted away he grew less and less exacting, until at last he was willingto serve in the humblest capacities if so he might get bread and shelter.But luck was still against him; he could find no opening of any sort.Finally his money was all gone. He walked the streets all day, thinking;he walked them all night, thinking, thinking, and growing hungrier andhungrier. At dawn he found himself well away from the town and driftingaimlessly along the harbor shore. As he was passing by a noddingshark-fisher the man looked up and said----
"Say, young fellow, take my line a spell, and change my luck for me."
"How do you know I won't make it worse?"
"Because you can't. It has been at its worst all night. If you can'tchange it, no harm's done; if you do change it, it's for the better,of course. Come."
"All right, what will you give?"
"I'll give you the shark, if you catch one."
"And I will eat it, bones and all. Give me the line."
"Here you are. I will get away, now, for awhile, so that my luck won'tspoil yours; for many and many a time I've noticed that if----there, pullin, pull in, man, you've got a bite! I knew how it would be. Why, Iknew you for a born son of luck the minute I saw you. All right--he'slanded."
It was an unusually large shark--"a full nineteen-footer," the fishermansaid, as he laid the creature open with his knife.
"Now you rob him, young man, while I step to my hamper for a fresh bait.There's generally something in them worth going for. You've changed myluck, you see. But my goodness, I hope you haven't changed your own."
"Oh, it wouldn't matter; don't worry about that. Get your bait. I'llrob him."
When the fisherman got back the young man had just finished washing hishands in the bay, and was starting away.
"What, you are not going?"
"Yes. Good-bye."
"But what about your shark?"
"The shark? Why, what use is he to me?"
"What use is he? I like that. Don't you know that we can go and reporthim to Government, and you'll get a clean solid eighty shillings bounty?Hard cash, you know. What do you think about it now?"
"Oh, well, you can collect it."
"And keep it? Is that what you mean?"
"Yes."
"Well, this is odd. You're one of those sort they call eccentrics, Ijudge. The saying is, you mustn't judge a man by his clothes, and I'mbelieving it now. Why yours are looking just ratty, don't you know; andyet you must be rich."
"I am."
The young man walked slowly back to the town, deeply musing as he went.He halted a moment in front of the best restaurant, then glanced at hisclothes and passed on, and got his breakfast at a "stand-up." There wasa good deal of it, and it cost five shillings. He tendered a sovereign,got his change, glanced at his silver, muttered to himself, "There isn'tenough to buy clothes with," and went his way.
At half-past nine the richest wool-broker in Sydney was sitting in hismorning-room at home, settling his breakfast with the morning paper. Aservant put his head in and said:
"There's a sundowner at the door wants to see you, sir."
"What do you bring that kind of a message here for? Send him about hisbusiness."
"He won't go, sir. I've tried."
"He won't go? That's--why, that's unusual. He's one of two things,then: he's a remarkable person, or he's crazy. Is he crazy?"
"No, sir. He don't look it."
"Then he's remarkable. What does he say he wants?"
"He won't tell, sir; only says it's very important."
"And won't go. Does he say he won't go?"
"Says he'll stand there till he sees you, sir, if it's all day."
"And yet isn't crazy. Show him up."
The sundowner was shown in. The broker said to himself, "No, he's notcrazy; that is easy to see; so he must be the other thing."
Then aloud, "Well, my good fellow, be quick about it; don't waste anywords; what is it you want?"
"I want to borrow a hundred thousand pounds."
"Scott! (It's a mistake; he is crazy . . . . No--he can't be--notwith that eye.) Why, you take my breath away. Come, who are you?"
"Nobody that you know."
"What is your name?"
"Cecil Rhodes."
"No, I don't remember hearing the name before. Now then--just forcuriosity's sake--what has sent you to me on this extraordinary errand?"
"The intention to make a hundred thousand pounds for you and as much formyself within the next sixty days."
"Well, well, well. It is the most extraordinary idea that--sit down--youinterest me. And somehow you--well, you fascinate me; I think that thatis about the word. And it isn't your proposition--no, that doesn'tfascinate me; it's something else, I don't quite know what; somethingthat's born in you and oozes out of you, I suppose. Now then just forcuriosity's sake again, nothing more: as I understand it, it is yourdesire to bor----"
"I said intention."
"Pardon, so you did. I thought it was an unheedful use of the word--anunheedful valuing of its strength, you know."
"I knew its strength."
"Well, I must say--but look here, let me walk the floor a little, my mindis getting into a sort of whirl, though you don't seem disturbed any.(Plainly this young fellow isn't crazy; but as to his being remarkable--well, really he amounts to that, and something over.) Now then, Ibelieve I am beyond the reach of further astonishment. Strike, and sparenot. What is your scheme?"
"To buy the wool crop--deliverable in sixty days."
"What, the whole of it?"
"The whole of it."
"No, I was not quite out of the reach of surprises, after all. Why, howyou talk! Do you know what our crop is going to foot up?"
"Two and a half million sterling--maybe a little more."
"Well, you've got your statistics right, any way. Now, then, do you knowwhat the margins would foot up, to buy it at sixty days?"
"The hundred thousand pounds I came here to get."
"Right, once more. Well, dear me, just to see what would happen, I wishyou had the money. And if you had it, what would you do with it?"
"I shall make two hundred thousand pounds out of it in sixty days."
"You mean, of course, that you might make it if----"
"I said 'shall'."
"Yes, by George, you did say 'shall'! You are the most definite devil Iever saw, in the matter of language. Dear, dear, dear, look here!Definite speech means clarity of mind. Upon my word I believe you've gotwhat you believe to be a rational reason, for venturing into this house,an entire stranger, on this wild scheme of buying the wool crop of anentire colony on speculation. Bring it out--I am prepared--acclimatized,if I may use the word. Why would you buy the crop, and why would youmake that sum out of it? That is to say, what makes you think you----"
"I don't think--I know."
"Definite again. How do you know?"
"Because France has declared war against Germany, and wool has gone upfourteen per cent. in London and is still rising."
"Oh, in-deed? Now then, I've got you! Such a thunderbolt as you havejust let fly ought to have made me jump out of my chair, but it didn'tstir me the least little bit, you see. And for a very simple reason: Ihave read the morning paper. You can look at it if you want to. Thefastest ship in the service arrived at eleven o'clock last night, fiftydays out from London. All her news is printed here. There are nowar-clouds anywhere; and as for wool, why, it is the low-spiritedestcommodity in the English market. It is your turn to jump, now . . . .Well, why, don't you jump? Why do you sit there in that placid fashion,when----"
"Because I have later news."
"Later news? Oh, come--later news than fifty days, brought steaming hotfrom London by the----"
"My news is only ten days old."
"Oh, Mun-chausen, hear the maniac talk! Where did you get it?"
"Got it out of a shark."
"Oh, oh, oh, this is too much! Front! call the police bring the gun--raise the town! All the asylums in Christendom have broken loose in thesingle person of----"
"Sit down! And collect yourself. Where is the use in getting excited?Am I excited? There is nothing to get excited about. When I make astatement which I cannot prove, it will be time enough for you to beginto offer hospitality to damaging fancies about me and my sanity."
"Oh, a thousand, thousand pardons! I ought to be ashamed of myself, andI am ashamed of myself for thinking that a little bit of a circumstancelike sending a shark to England to fetch back a market report----"
"What does your middle initial stand for, sir?"
"Andrew. What are you writing?"
"Wait a moment. Proof about the shark--and another matter. Only tenlines. There--now it is done. Sign it."
"Many thanks--many. Let me see; it says--it says oh, come, this isinteresting! Why--why--look here! prove what you say here, and I'll putup the money, and double as much, if necessary, and divide the winningswith you, half and half. There, now--I've signed; make your promise goodif you can. Show me a copy of the London Times only ten days old."
"Here it is--and with it these buttons and a memorandum book thatbelonged to the man the shark swallowed. Swallowed him in the Thames,without a doubt; for you will notice that the last entry in the book isdated 'London,' and is of the same date as the Times, and says, 'Berconfequentz der Kreigeseflarun, reife ich heute nach Deutchland ab, aurbak ich mein leben auf dem Ultar meines Landes legen mag'----, as cleannative German as anybody can put upon paper, and means that inconsequence of the declaration of war, this loyal soul is leaving forhome to-day, to fight. And he did leave, too, but the shark had himbefore the day was done, poor fellow."
"And a pity, too. But there are times for mourning, and we will attendto this case further on; other matters are pressing, now. I will go downand set the machinery in motion in a quiet way and buy the crop. It willcheer the drooping spirits of the boys, in a transitory way. Everythingis transitory in this world. Sixty days hence, when they are called todeliver the goods, they will think they've been struck by lightning. Butthere is a time for mourning, and we will attend to that case along withthe other one. Come along, I'll take you to my tailor. What did you sayyour name is?"
"Cecil Rhodes."
"It is hard to remember. However, I think you will make it easier by andby, if you live. There are three kinds of people--Commonplace Men,Remarkable Men, and Lunatics. I'll classify you with the Remarkables,and take the chances."
The deal went through, and secured to the young stranger the firstfortune he ever pocketed.
The people of Sydney ought to be afraid of the sharks, but for somereason they do not seem to be. On Saturdays the young men go out intheir boats, and sometimes the water is fairly covered with the littlesails. A boat upsets now and then, by accident, a result of tumultuousskylarking; sometimes the boys upset their boat for fun--such as it iswith sharks visibly waiting around for just such an occurrence. Theyoung fellows scramble aboard whole--sometimes--not always. Tragedieshave happened more than once. While I was in Sydney it was reported thata boy fell out of a boat in the mouth of the Paramatta river and screamedfor help and a boy jumped overboard from another boat to save him fromthe assembling sharks; but the sharks made swift work with the lives ofboth.
The government pays a bounty for the shark; to get the bounty thefishermen bait the hook or the seine with agreeable mutton; the newsspreads and the sharks come from all over the Pacific Ocean to get thefree board. In time the shark culture will be one of the most successfulthings in the colony.
