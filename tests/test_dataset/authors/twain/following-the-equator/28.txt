Let us be thankful for the fools. But for them the rest of us could notsucceed. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The aphorism does really seem true: "Given the Circumstances, the Manwill appear." But the man musn't appear ahead of time, or it will spoileverything. In Robinson's case the Moment had been approaching for aquarter of a century--and meantime the future Conciliator was tranquillylaying bricks in Hobart. When all other means had failed, the Moment hadarrived, and the Bricklayer put down his trowel and came forward.Earlier he would have been jeered back to his trowel again. It remindsme of a tale that was told me by a Kentuckian on the train when we werecrossing Montana. He said the tale was current in Louisville years ago.He thought it had been in print, but could not remember. At any rate, insubstance it was this, as nearly as I can call it back to mind.
A few years before the outbreak of the Civil War it began to appear thatMemphis, Tennessee, was going to be a great tobacco entrepot--the wisecould see the signs of it. At that time Memphis had a wharf boat, ofcourse. There was a paved sloping wharf, for the accommodation offreight, but the steamers landed on the outside of the wharfboat, and allloading and unloading was done across it, between steamer and shore. Anumber of wharfboat clerks were needed, and part of the time, every day,they were very busy, and part of the time tediously idle. They wereboiling over with youth and spirits, and they had to make the intervalsof idleness endurable in some way; and as a rule, they did it bycontriving practical jokes and playing them upon each other.
The favorite butt for the jokes was Ed Jackson, because he played nonehimself, and was easy game for other people's--for he always believedwhatever was told him.
One day he told the others his scheme for his holiday. He was not goingfishing or hunting this time--no, he had thought out a better plan. Outof his $40 a month he had saved enough for his purpose, in an economicalway, and he was going to have a look at New York.
It was a great and surprising idea. It meant travel immense travel--inthose days it meant seeing the world; it was the equivalent of a voyagearound it in ours. At first the other youths thought his mind wasaffected, but when they found that he was in earnest, the next thing tobe thought of was, what sort of opportunity this venture might afford fora practical joke.
The young men studied over the matter, then held a secret consultationand made a plan. The idea was, that one of the conspirators should offerEd a letter of introduction to Commodore Vanderbilt, and trick him intodelivering it. It would be easy to do this. But what would Ed do whenhe got back to Memphis? That was a serious matter. He was good-hearted,and had always taken the jokes patiently; but they had been jokes whichdid not humiliate him, did not bring him to shame; whereas, this would bea cruel one in that way, and to play it was to meddle with fire; for withall his good nature, Ed was a Southerner--and the English of that was,that when he came back he would kill as many of the conspirators as hecould before falling himself. However, the chances must be taken--itwouldn't do to waste such a joke as that.
So the letter was prepared with great care and elaboration. It wassigned Alfred Fairchild, and was written in an easy and friendly spirit.It stated that the bearer was the bosom friend of the writer's son, andwas of good parts and sterling character, and it begged the Commodore tobe kind to the young stranger for the writer's sake. It went on to say,"You may have forgotten me, in this long stretch of time, but you willeasily call me back out of your boyhood memories when I remind you of howwe robbed old Stevenson's orchard that night; and how, while he waschasing down the road after us, we cut across the field and doubled backand sold his own apples to his own cook for a hat-full of doughnuts; andthe time that we----" and so forth and so on, bringing in names ofimaginary comrades, and detailing all sorts of wild and absurd and, ofcourse, wholly imaginary schoolboy pranks and adventures, but puttingthem into lively and telling shape.
With all gravity Ed was asked if he would like to have a letter toCommodore Vanderbilt, the great millionaire. It was expected that thequestion would astonish Ed, and it did.
"What? Do you know that extraordinary man?"
"No; but my father does. They were schoolboys together. And if youlike, I'll write and ask father. I know he'll be glad to give it to youfor my sake."
Ed could not find words capable of expressing his gratitude and delight.The three days passed, and the letter was put into his bands. He startedon his trip, still pouring out his thanks while he shook good-bye allaround. And when he was out of sight his comrades let fly their laughterin a storm of happy satisfaction--and then quieted down, and were lesshappy, less satisfied. For the old doubts as to the wisdom of thisdeception began to intrude again.
Arrived in New York, Ed found his way to Commodore Vanderbilt's businessquarters, and was ushered into a large anteroom, where a score of peoplewere patiently awaiting their turn for a two-minute interview with themillionaire in his private office. A servant asked for Ed's card, andgot the letter instead. Ed was sent for a moment later, and found Mr.Vanderbilt alone, with the letter--open--in his hand.
"Pray sit down, Mr. --er--"
"Jackson."
"Ah--sit down, Mr. Jackson. By the opening sentences it seems to be aletter from an old friend. Allow me--I will run my eye through it. Hesays he says--why, who is it?" He turned the sheet and found thesignature. "Alfred Fairchild--hm--Fairchild--I don't recall the name.But that is nothing--a thousand names have gone from me. He says--hesays-hm-hmoh, dear, but it's good! Oh, it's rare! I don't quiteremember it, but I seem to it'll all come back to me presently. He says--he says--hm--hm-oh, but that was a game! Oh, spl-endid! How itcarries me back! It's all dim, of course it's a long time ago--and thenames--some of the names are wavery and indistinct--but sho', I know ithappened--I can feel it! and lord, how it warms my heart, and bringsback my lost youth! Well, well, well, I've got to come back into thiswork-a-day world now--business presses and people are waiting--I'll keepthe rest for bed to-night, and live my youth over again. And you'llthank Fairchild for me when you see him--I used to call him Alf, I think--and you'll give him my gratitude for--what this letter has done for thetired spirit of a hard-worked man; and tell him there isn't anything thatI can do for him or any friend of his that I won't do. And as for you,my lad, you are my guest; you can't stop at any hotel in New York. Sit.where you are a little while, till I get through with these people, thenwe'll go home. I'll take care of you, my boy--make yourself easy as tothat."
Ed stayed a week, and had an immense time--and never suspected that theCommodore's shrewd eye was on him, and that he was daily being weighedand measured and analyzed and tried and tested.
Yes, he had an immense time; and never wrote home, but saved it all up totell when he should get back. Twice, with proper modesty and decency, heproposed to end his visit, but the Commodore said, "No--wait; leave it tome; I'll tell you when to go."
In those days the Commodore was making some of those vast combinations ofhis--consolidations of warring odds and ends of railroads into harmonioussystems, and concentrations of floating and rudderless commerce ineffective centers--and among other things his farseeing eye had detectedthe convergence of that huge tobacco-commerce, already spoken of, towardMemphis, and he had resolved to set his grasp upon it and make it hisown.
The week came to an end. Then the Commodore said:
"Now you can start home. But first we will have some more talk aboutthat tobacco matter. I know you now. I know your abilities as well asyou know them yourself--perhaps better. You understand that tobaccomatter; you understand that I am going to take possession of it, and youalso understand the plans which I have matured for doing it. What I wantis a man who knows my mind, and is qualified to represent me in Memphis,and be in supreme command of that important business--and I appoint you."
"Me!"
"Yes. Your salary will be high--of course-for you are representing me.Later you will earn increases of it, and will get them. You will need asmall army of assistants; choose them yourself--and carefully. Take noman for friendship's sake; but, all things being equal, take the man youknow, take your friend, in preference to the stranger." After somefurther talk under this head, the Commodore said:
"Good-bye, my boy, and thank Alf for me, for sending you to me."
When Ed reached Memphis he rushed down to the wharf in a fever to tellhis great news and thank the boys over and over again for thinking togive him the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt. It happened to be one of thoseidle times. Blazing hot noonday, and no sign of life on the wharf. Butas Ed threaded his way among the freight piles, he saw a white linenfigure stretched in slumber upon a pile of grain-sacks under an awning,and said to himself, "That's one of them," and hastened his step; next,he said, "It's Charley--it's Fairchild good"; and the next moment laid anaffectionate hand on the sleeper's shoulder. The eyes opened lazily,took one glance, the face blanched, the form whirled itself from thesack-pile, and in an instant Ed was alone and Fairchild was flying forthe wharf-boat like the wind!
Ed was dazed, stupefied. Was Fairchild crazy? What could be the meaningof this? He started slow and dreamily down toward the wharf-boat; turnedthe corner of a freight-pile and came suddenly upon two of the boys.They were lightly laughing over some pleasant matter; they heard hisstep, and glanced up just as he discovered them; the laugh died abruptly;and before Ed could speak they were off, and sailing over barrels andbales like hunted deer. Again Ed was paralyzed. Had the boys all gonemad? What could be the explanation of this extraordinary conduct? Andso, dreaming along, he reached the wharf-boat, and stepped aboard nothingbut silence there, and vacancy. He crossed the deck, turned the cornerto go down the outer guard, heard a fervent--
"O lord!" and saw a white linen form plunge overboard.
The youth came up coughing and strangling, and cried out--
"Go 'way from here! You let me alone. I didn't do it, I swear Ididn't!"
"Didn't do what?"
"Give you the----"
"Never mind what you didn't do--come out of that! What makes you all actso? What have I done?"
"You? Why you haven't done anything. But----"
"Well, then, what have you got against me? What do you all treat me sofor?"
"I--er--but haven't you got anything against us?"
"Of course not. What put such a thing into your head?"
"Honor bright--you haven't?
"Honor bright."
"Swear it!"
"I don't know what in the world you mean, but I swear it, anyway."
"And you'll shake hands with me?"
"Goodness knows I'll be glad to! Why, I'm just starving to shake handswith somebody!"
The swimmer muttered, "Hang him, he smelt a rat and never delivered theletter!--but it's all right, I'm not going to fetch up the subject." Andhe crawled out and came dripping and draining to shake hands. First oneand then another of the conspirators showed up cautiously--armed to theteeth--took in the amicable situation, then ventured warily forward andjoined the love-feast.
And to Ed's eager inquiry as to what made them act as they had beenacting, they answered evasively, and pretended that they had put it up asa joke, to see what he would do. It was the best explanation they couldinvent at such short notice. And each said to himself, "He neverdelivered that letter, and the joke is on us, if he only knew it or wewere dull enough to come out and tell."
Then, of course, they wanted to know all about the trip; and he said--
"Come right up on the boiler deck and order the drinks it's my treat.I'm going to tell you all about it. And to-night it's my treat again--and we'll have oysters and a time!"
When the drinks were brought and cigars lighted, Ed said:
"Well, when, I delivered the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt----"
"Great Scott!"
"Gracious, how you scared me. What's the matter?"
"Oh--er--nothing. Nothing--it was a tack in the chair-seat," said one.
"But you all said it. However, no matter. When I delivered theletter----"
"Did you deliver it?" And they looked at each other as people might whothought that maybe they were dreaming.
Then they settled to listening; and as the story deepened and its marvelsgrew, the amazement of it made them dumb, and the interest of it tooktheir breath. They hardly uttered a whisper during two hours, but satlike petrifactions and drank in the immortal romance. At last the talewas ended, and Ed said--
"And it's all owing to you, boys, and you'll never find me ungrateful--bless your hearts, the best friends a fellow ever had! You'll all haveplaces; I want every one of you. I know you--I know you 'by the back,'as the gamblers say. You're jokers, and all that, but you're sterling,with the hallmark on. And Charley Fairchild, you shall be my firstassistant and right hand, because of your first-class ability, andbecause you got me the letter, and for your father's sake who wrote itfor me, and to please Mr. Vanderbilt, who said it would! And here's tothat great man--drink hearty!"
Yes, when the Moment comes, the Man appears--even if he is a thousandmiles away, and has to be discovered by a practical joke.
