SCENE
Lawn in front of the terrace at Hunstanton.
[SIR JOHN and LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, on chairsunder large yew tree.]
LADY CAROLINE. I believe this is the first English country houseyou have stayed at, Miss Worsley?
HESTER. Yes, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. You have no country houses, I am told, in America?
HESTER. We have not many.
LADY CAROLINE. Have you any country? What we should call country?
HESTER. [Smiling.] We have the largest country in the world, LadyCaroline. They used to tell us at school that some of our statesare as big as France and England put together.
LADY CAROLINE. Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.[To SIR JOHN.] John, you should have your muffler. What is theuse of my always knitting mufflers for you if you won't wear them?
SIR JOHN. I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.
LADY CAROLINE. I think not, John. Well, you couldn't come to amore charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house isexcessively damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstantonis sometimes a little lax about the people she asks down here. [ToSIR JOHN.] Jane mixes too much. Lord Illingworth, of course, is aman of high distinction. It is a privilege to meet him. And thatmember of Parliament, Mr. Kettle -
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
LADY CAROLINE. He must be quite respectable. One has never heardhis name before in the whole course of one's life, which speaksvolumes for a man, nowadays. But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a verysuitable person.
HESTER. I dislike Mrs. Allonby. I dislike her more than I cansay.
LADY CAROLINE. I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners likeyourself should cultivate likes or dislikes about the people theyare invited to meet. Mrs. Allonby is very well born. She is aniece of Lord Brancaster's. It is said, of course, that she ranaway twice before she was married. But you know how unfair peopleoften are. I myself don't believe she ran away more than once.
HESTER. Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming.
LADY CAROLINE. Ah, yes! the young man who has a post in a bank.Lady Hunstanton is most kind in asking him here, and LordIllingworth seems to have taken quite a fancy to him. I am notsure, however, that Jane is right in taking him out of hisposition. In my young days, Miss Worsley, one never met any one insociety who worked for their living. It was not considered thething.
HESTER. In America those are the people we respect most.
LADY CAROLINE. I have no doubt of it.
HESTER. Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature! He is so simple, sosincere. He has one of the most beautiful natures I have ever comeacross. It is a privilege to meet HIM.
LADY CAROLINE. It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for ayoung lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of theopposite sex. English women conceal their feelings till after theyare married. They show them then.
HESTER. Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between ayoung man and a young girl?
[Enter LADY HUNSTANTON, followed by Footman with shawls and acushion.]
LADY CAROLINE. We think it very inadvisable. Jane, I was justsaying what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet. You have awonderful power of selection. It is quite a gift.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Dear Caroline, how kind of you! I think we alldo fit in very nicely together. And I hope our charming Americanvisitor will carry back pleasant recollections of our Englishcountry life. [To Footman.] The cushion, there, Francis. And myshawl. The Shetland. Get the Shetland. [Exit Footman for shawl.]
[Enter GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]
GERALD. Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you. LordIllingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.
LADY HUNSTANTON. His secretary? That is good news indeed, Gerald.It means a very brilliant future in store for you. Your dearmother will be delighted. I really must try and induce her to comeup here to-night. Do you think she would, Gerald? I know howdifficult it is to get her to go anywhere.
GERALD. Oh! I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knewLord Illingworth had made me such an offer.
[Enter Footman with shawl.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. I will write and tell her about it, and ask herto come up and meet him. [To Footman.] Just wait, Francis.[Writes letter.]
LADY CAROLINE. That is a very wonderful opening for so young a manas you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.
GERALD. It is indeed, Lady Caroline. I trust I shall be able toshow myself worthy of it.
LADY CAROLINE. I trust so.
GERALD. [To HESTER.] YOU have not congratulated me yet, MissWorsley.
HESTER. Are you very pleased about it?
GERALD. Of course I am. It means everything to me - things thatwere out of the reach of hope before may be within hope's reachnow.
HESTER. Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. Life is ahope.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what LordIllingworth is aiming at. I heard that he was offered Vienna. Butthat may not be true.
LADY CAROLINE. I don't think that England should be representedabroad by an unmarried man, Jane. It might lead to complications.
LADY HUNSTANTON. You are too nervous, Caroline. Believe me, youare too nervous. Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day. Iwas in hopes he would have married lady Kelso. But I believe hesaid her family was too large. Or was it her feet? I forgetwhich. I regret it very much. She was made to be an ambassador'swife.
LADY CAROLINE. She certainly has a wonderful faculty ofremembering people's names, and forgetting their faces.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?[To Footman.] Tell Henry to wait for an answer. I have written aline to your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, andto say she really must come to dinner.
[Exit Footman.]
GERALD. That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton. [ToHESTER.] Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?
HESTER. With pleasure [Exit with GERALD.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot'sgood fortune. He is quite a PROTEGE of mine. And I amparticularly pleased that Lord Illingworth should have made theoffer of his own accord without my suggesting anything. Nobodylikes to be asked favours. I remember poor Charlotte Pagden makingherself quite unpopular one season, because she had a Frenchgoverness she wanted to recommend to every one.
LADY CAROLINE. I saw the governess, Jane. Lady Pagden sent her tome. It was before Eleanor came out. She was far too good-lookingto be in any respectable household. I don't wonder Lady Pagden wasso anxious to get rid of her.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, that explains it.
LADY CAROLINE. John, the grass is too damp for you. You hadbetter go and put on your overshoes at once.
SIR JOHN. I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.
LADY CAROLINE. You must allow me to be the best judge of that,John. Pray do as I tell you.
[SIR JOHN gets up and goes off.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!
[Enter MRS. ALLONBY and LADY STUTFIELD.]
 [To MRS. ALLONBY.] Well, dear, I hope you like the park. It issaid to be well timbered.
MRS. ALLONBY. The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.
LADY STUTFIELD. Quite, quite wonderful.
MRS. ALLONBY. But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in thecountry for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that noone would take the slightest notice of me.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I assure you, dear, that the country has not thateffect at all. Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two milesfrom here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale. Iremember the occurrence perfectly. Poor Lord Belton died threedays afterwards of joy, or gout. I forget which. We had a largeparty staying here at the time, so we were all very much interestedin the whole affair.
MRS. ALLONBY. I think to elope is cowardly. It's running awayfrom danger. And danger has become so rare in modern life.
LADY CAROLINE. As far as I can make out, the young women of thepresent day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to bealways playing with fire.
MRS. ALLONBY. The one advantage of playing with fire, LadyCaroline, is that one never gets even singed. It is the people whodon't know how to play with it who get burned up.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; I see that. It is very, very helpful.
LADY HUNSTANTON. I don't know how the world would get on with sucha theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.
LADY STUTFIELD. Ah! The world was made for men and not for women.
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, don't say that, Lady Stutfield. We have a muchbetter time than they have. There are far more things forbidden tous than are forbidden to them.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; that is quite, quite true. I had not thoughtof that.
[Enter SIR JOHN and MR. KELVIL.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?
KELVIL. I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton.It has been an arduous task. The demands on the time of a publicman are very heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed. And I don't thinkthey meet with adequate recognition.
LADY CAROLINE. John, have you got your overshoes on?
SIR JOHN. Yes, my love.
LADY CAROLINE. I think you had better come over here, John. It ismore sheltered.
SIR JOHN. I am quite comfortable, Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. I think not, John. You had better sit beside me.[SIR JOHN rises and goes across.]
LADY STUTFIELD. And what have you been writing about this morning,Mr. Kelvil?
KELVIL. On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield. On Purity.
LADY STUTFIELD. That must be such a very, very interesting thingto write about.
KELVIL. It is the one subject of really national importance,nowadays, Lady Stutfield. I purpose addressing my constituents onthe question before Parliament meets. I find that the poorerclasses of this country display a marked desire for a higherethical standard.
LADY STUTFIELD. How quite, quite nice of them.
LADY CAROLINE. Are you in favour of women taking part in politics,Mr. Kettle?
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
KELVIL. The growing influence of women is the one reassuring thingin our political life, Lady Caroline. Women are always on the sideof morality, public and private.
LADY STUTFIELD. It is so very, very gratifying to hear you saythat.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, yes! - the moral qualities in women - that isthe important thing. I am afraid, Caroline, that dear LordIllingworth doesn't value the moral qualities in women as much ashe should.
[Enter LORD ILLINGWORTH.]
LADY STUTFIELD. The world says that Lord Illingworth is very, verywicked.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. But what world says that, Lady Stutfield? Itmust be the next world. This world and I are on excellent terms.[Sits down beside MRS. ALLONBY.]
LADY STUTFIELD. Every one I know says you are very, very wicked.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is perfectly monstrous the way people goabout, nowadays, saying things against one behind one's back thatare absolutely and entirely true.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Dear Lord Illingworth is quite hopeless, LadyStutfield. I have given up trying to reform him. It would take aPublic Company with a Board of Directors and a paid Secretary to dothat. But you have the secretary already, Lord Illingworth,haven't you? Gerald Arbuthnot has told us of his good fortune; itis really most kind of you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, don't say that, Lady Hunstanton. Kind is adreadful word. I took a great fancy to young Arbuthnot the momentI met him, and he'll be of considerable use to me in something I amfoolish enough to think of doing.
LADY HUNSTANTON. He is an admirable young man. And his mother isone of my dearest friends. He has just gone for a walk with ourpretty American. She is very pretty, is she not?
LADY CAROLINE. Far too pretty. These American girls carry off allthe good matches. Why can't they stay in their own country? Theyare always telling us it is the Paradise of women.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is, Lady Caroline. That is why, like Eve,they are so extremely anxious to get out of it.
LADY CAROLINE. Who are Miss Worsley's parents?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. American women are wonderfully clever inconcealing their parents.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean? MissWorsley, Caroline, is an orphan. Her father was a very wealthymillionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertainedmy son quite hospitably, when he visited Boston. I don't know howhe made his money, originally.
KELVIL. I fancy in American dry goods.
LADY HUNSTANTON. What are American dry goods?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. American novels.
LADY HUNSTANTON. How very singular! . . . Well, from whateversource her large fortune came, I have a great esteem for MissWorsley. She dresses exceedingly well. All Americans do dresswell. They get their clothes in Paris.
MRS. ALLONBY. They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americansdie they go to Paris.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Indeed? And when bad Americans die, where dothey go to?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, they go to America.
KELVIL. I am afraid you don't appreciate America, LordIllingworth. It is a very remarkable country, especiallyconsidering its youth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. The youth of America is their oldest tradition.It has been going on now for three hundred years. To hear themtalk one would imagine they were in their first childhood. As faras civilisation goes they are in their second.
KELVIL. There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption inAmerican politics. I suppose you allude to that?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I wonder.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.They certainly are in England. Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining thecountry. I wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him. I am sure, LordIllingworth, you don't think that uneducated people should beallowed to have votes?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I think they are the only people who should.
KELVIL. Do you take no side then in modern politics, LordIllingworth?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should never take sides in anything, Mr.Kelvil. Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, andearnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomesa bore. However, the House of Commons really does very littleharm. You can't make people good by Act of Parliament, - that issomething.
KELVIL. You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always showngreat sympathy with the sufferings of the poor.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. That is its special vice. That is the specialvice of the age. One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty,the colour of life. The less said about life's sores the better,Mr. Kelvil.
KELVIL. Still our East End is a very important problem.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Quite so. It is the problem of slavery. And weare trying to solve it by amusing the slaves.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Certainly, a great deal may be done by means ofcheap entertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth. Dear Dr.Daubeny, our rector here, provides, with the assistance of hiscurates, really admirable recreations for the poor during thewinter. And much good may be done by means of a magic lantern, ora missionary, or some popular amusement of that kind.
LADY CAROLINE. I am not at all in favour of amusements for thepoor, Jane. Blankets and coals are sufficient. There is too muchlove of pleasure amongst the upper classes as it is. Health iswhat we want in modern life. The tone is not healthy, not healthyat all.
KELVIL. You are quite right, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. I believe I am usually right.
MRS. ALLONBY. Horrid word 'health.'
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Silliest word in our language, and one knows sowell the popular idea of health. The English country gentlemangalloping after a fox - the unspeakable in full pursuit of theuneatable.
KELVIL. May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House ofLords as a better institution than the House of Commons?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. A much better institution, of course. We in theHouse of Lords are never in touch with public opinion. That makesus a civilised body.
KELVIL. Are you serious in putting forward such a view?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil. [To MRS. ALLONBY.]Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after onehas given them an idea, whether one is serious or not. Nothing isserious except passion. The intellect is not a serious thing, andnever has been. It is an instrument on which one plays, that isall. The only serious form of intellect I know is the Britishintellect. And on the British intellect the illiterates play thedrum.
LADY HUNSTANTON. What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about thedrum?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about theleading articles in the London newspapers.
LADY HUNSTANTON. But do you believe all that is written in thenewspapers?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I do. Nowadays it is only the unreadable thatoccurs. [Rises with MRS. ALLONBY.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?
MRS. ALLONBY. Just as far as the conservatory. Lord Illingworthtold me this morning that there was an orchid there m beautiful asthe seven deadly sins.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind. Iwill certainly speak to the gardener.
[Exit MRS. ALLONBY and LORD ILLINGWORTH.]
LADY CAROLINE. Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.
LADY HUNSTANTON. She lets her clever tongue run away with hersometimes.
LADY CAROLINE. Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allowsto run away with her?
LADY HUNSTANTON. I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.
[Enter LORD ALFRED.]
Dear Lord Alfred, do join us. [LORD ALFRED sits down beside LADYSTUTFIELD.]
LADY CAROLINE. You believe good of every one, Jane. It is a greatfault.
LADY STUTFIELD. Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, thatone should believe evil of every one?
LADY CAROLINE. I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.Until, of course, people are found out to be good. But thatrequires a great deal of investigation nowadays.
LADY STUTFIELD. But there is so much unkind scandal in modernlife.
LADY CAROLINE. Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night atdinner that the basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoralcertainty.
KELVIL. Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, buthe seems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility andpurity of life which is so important in this century.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?
KELVIL. He gives me the impression of a man who does notappreciate the beauty of our English home-life. I would say thathe was tainted with foreign ideas on the subject.
LADY STUTFIELD. There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-life, is there?
KELVIL. It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, LadyStutfield. Without it we would become like our neighbours.
LADY STUTFIELD. That would be so, so sad, would it not?
KELVIL. I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards womansimply as a toy. Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy. Womanis the intellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.Without her we should forget the true ideals. [Sits down besideLADY STUTFIELD.]
LADY STUTFIELD. I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.
LADY CAROLINE. You a married man, Mr. Kettle?
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.
KELVIL. I am married, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE. Family?
KELVIL. Yes.
LADY CAROLINE. How many?
KELVIL. Eight.
[LADY STUTFIELD turns her attention to LORD ALFRED.]
LADY CAROLINE. Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at theseaside? [SIR JOHN shrugs his shoulders.]
KELVIL. My wife is at the seaside with the children, LadyCaroline.
LADY CAROLINE. You will join them later on, no doubt?
KELVIL. If my public engagements permit me.
LADY CAROLINE. Your public life must be a great source ofgratification to Mrs. Kettle.
SIR JOHN. Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
LADY STUTFIELD. [To LORD ALFRED.] How very, very charming thosegold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.
LORD ALFRED. They are awfully expensive. I can only afford themwhen I'm in debt.
LADY STUTFIELD. It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be indebt.
LORD ALFRED. One must have some occupation nowadays. If I hadn'tmy debts I shouldn't have anything to think about. All the chaps Iknow are in debt.
LADY STUTFIELD. But don't the people to whom you owe the moneygive you a great, great deal of annoyance?
[Enter Footman.]
LORD ALFRED. Oh, no, they write; I don't.
LADY STUTFIELD. How very, very strange.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.Arbuthnot. She won't dine. I am so sorry. But she will come inthe evening. I am very pleased indeed. She is one of the sweetestof women. Writes a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm. [Handsletter to LADY CAROLINE.]
LADY CAROLINE. [Looking at it.] A little lacking in femininity,Jane. Femininity is the quality I admire most in women.
LADY HUNSTANTON. [Taking back letter and leaving it on table.]Oh! she is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too. You shouldhear what the Archdeacon says of her. He regards her as his righthand in the parish. [Footman speaks to her.] In the YellowDrawing-room. Shall we all go in? Lady Stutfield, shall we go into tea?
LADY STUTFIELD. With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton. [They rise andproceed to go off. SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD'Scloak.]
LADY CAROLINE. John! If you would allow your nephew to look afterLady Stutfield's cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.
[Enter LORD ILLINGWORTH and MRS. ALLONBY.]
SIR JOHN. Certainly, my love. [Exeunt.]
MRS. ALLONBY. Curious thing, plain women are always jealous oftheir husbands, beautiful women never are!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Beautiful women never have time. They arealways so occupied in being jealous of other people's husbands.
MRS. ALLONBY. I should have thought Lady Caroline would have growntired of conjugal anxiety by this time! Sir John is her fourth!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. So much marriage is certainly not becoming.Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twentyyears of marriage make her something like a public building.
MRS. ALLONBY. Twenty years of romance! Is there such a thing?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Not in our day. Women have become toobrilliant. Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humourin the woman.
MRS. ALLONBY. Or the want of it in the man.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You are quite right. In a Temple every oneshould be serious, except the thing that is worshipped.
MRS. ALLONBY. And that should be man?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Women kneel so gracefully; men don't.
MRS. ALLONBY. You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I assure you I have not thought of LadyStutfield for the last quarter of an hour.
MRS. ALLONBY. Is she such a mystery?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. She is more than a mystery - she is a mood.
MRS. ALLONBY. Moods don't last.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is their chief charm.
[Enter HESTER and GERALD.]
GERALD. Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me,Lady Hunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one. I hope Ishall make a good secretary.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.[Talks to him.]
MRS. ALLONBY. You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?
HESTER. Very much indeed.
MRS. ALLONBY. Don't find yourself longing for a London dinner-party?
HESTER. I dislike London dinner-parties.
MRS. ALLONBY. I adore them. The clever people never listen, andthe stupid people never talk.
HESTER. I think the stupid people talk a great deal.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, I never listen!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear boy, if I didn't like you I wouldn'thave made you the offer. It is because I like you so much that Iwant to have you with me.
[Exit HESTER with GERALD.]
Charming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!
MRS. ALLONBY. He is very nice; very nice indeed. But I can'tstand the American young lady.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Why?
MRS. ALLONBY. She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voicetoo, that she was only eighteen. It was most annoying.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One should never trust a woman who tells one herreal age. A woman who would tell one that, would tell oneanything.
MRS. ALLONBY. She is a Puritan besides -
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Ah, that is inexcusable. I don't mind plainwomen being Puritans. It is the only excuse they have for beingplain. But she is decidedly pretty. I admire her immensely.[Looks steadfastly at MRS. ALLONBY.]
MRS. ALLONBY. What a thoroughly bad man you must be!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What do you call a bad man?
MRS. ALLONBY. The sort of man who admires innocence.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. And a bad woman?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You are severe - on yourself.
MRS. ALLONBY. Define us as a sex.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Sphinxes without secrets.
MRS. ALLONBY. Does that include the Puritan women?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Do you know, I don't believe in the existence ofPuritan women? I don't think there is a woman in the world whowould not be a little flattered if one made love to her. It isthat which makes women so irresistibly adorable.
MRS. ALLONBY. You think there is no woman in the world who wouldobject to being kissed?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Very few.
MRS. ALLONBY. Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Are you sure?
MRS. ALLONBY. Quite.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What do you think she'd do if I kissed her?
MRS. ALLONBY. Either marry you, or strike you across the face withher glove. What would you do if she struck you across the facewith her glove?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Fall in love with her, probably.
MRS. ALLONBY. Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Is that a challenge?
MRS. ALLONBY. It is an arrow shot into the air.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Don't you know that I always succeed in whateverI try?
MRS. ALLONBY. I am sorry to hear it. We women adore failures.They lean on us.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You worship successes. You cling to them.
MRS. ALLONBY. We are the laurels to hide their baldness.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. And they need you always, except at the momentof triumph.
MRS. ALLONBY. They are uninteresting then.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. How tantalising you are! [A pause.]
MRS. ALLONBY. Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall alwayslike you for.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Only one thing? And I have so many badqualities.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, don't be too conceited about them. You may losethem as you grow old.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I never intend to grow old. The soul is bornold but grows young. That is the comedy of life.
MRS. ALLONBY. And the body is born young and grows old. That islife's tragedy.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Its comedy also, sometimes. But what is themysterious reason why you will always like me?
MRS. ALLONBY. It is that you have never made love to me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I have never done anything else.
MRS. ALLONBY. Really? I have not noticed it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. How fortunate! It might have been a tragedy forboth of us.
MRS. ALLONBY. We should each have survived.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. One can survive everything nowadays, exceptdeath, and live down anything except a good reputation.
MRS. ALLONBY. Have you tried a good reputation?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It is one of the many annoyances to which I havenever been subjected.
MRS. ALLONBY. It may come.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Why do you threaten me?
MRS. ALLONBY. I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.
[Enter Footman.]
FRANCIS. Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Tell her ladyship we are coming in.
FRANCIS. Yes, my lord.
[Exit.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Shall we go in to tea?
MRS. ALLONBY. Do you like such simple pleasures?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I adore simple pleasures. They are the lastrefuge of the complex. But, if you wish, let us stay here. Yes,let us stay here. The Book of Life begins with a man and a womanin a garden.
MRS. ALLONBY. It ends with Revelations.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You fence divinely. But the button has come ofyour foil.
MRS. ALLONBY. I have still the mask.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. It makes your eyes lovelier.
MRS. ALLONBY. Thank you. Come.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Sees MRS. ARBUTHNOT'S letter on table, andtakes it up and looks at envelope.] What a curious handwriting!It reminds me of the handwriting of a woman I used to know yearsago.
MRS. ALLONBY. Who?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh! no one. No one in particular. A woman ofno importance. [Throws letter down, and passes up the steps of theterrace with MRS. ALLONBY. They smile at each other.]
ACT DROP.
