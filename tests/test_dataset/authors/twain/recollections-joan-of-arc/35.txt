How Joan Took Jargeau
WE MADE a gallant show next day when we filed out through the frowninggates of Orleans, with banners flying and Joan and the Grand Staff in thevan of the long column. Those two young De Lavals were come now, and werejoined to the Grand Staff. Which was well; war being their proper trade,for they were grandsons of that illustrious fighter Bertrand du Guesclin,Constable of France in earlier days. Louis de Bourbon, the Marshal deRais, and the Vidame de Chartres were added also. We had a right to feela little uneasy, for we knew that a force of five thousand men was on itsway under Sir John Fastolfe to reinforce Jargeau, but I think we were notuneasy, nevertheless. In truth, that force was not yet in ourneighborhood. Sir John was loitering; for some reason or other he was nothurrying. He was losing precious time--four days at Etampes, and fourmore at Janville.
We reached Jargeau and began business at once. Joan sent forward a heavyforce which hurled itself against the outworks in handsome style, andgained a footing and fought hard to keep it; but it presently began tofall back before a sortie from the city. Seeing this, Joan raised herbattle-cry and led a new assault herself under a furious artillery fire.The Paladin was struck down at her side wounded, but she snatched herstandard from his failing hand and plunged on through the ruck of flyingmissiles, cheering her men with encouraging cries; and then for a goodtime one had turmoil, and clash of steel, and collision and confusion ofstruggling multitudes, and the hoarse bellowing of the guns; and then thehiding of it all under a rolling firmament of smoke--a firmament throughwhich veiled vacancies appeared for a moment now and then, giving fitfuldim glimpses of the wild tragedy enacting beyond; and always at thesetimes one caught sight of that slight figure in white mail which was thecenter and soul of our hope and trust, and whenever we saw that, with itsback to us and its face to the fight, we knew that all was well. At lasta great shout went up--a joyous roar of shoutings, in fact--and that wassign sufficient that the faubourgs were ours.
Yes, they were ours; the enemy had been driven back within the walls. Onthe ground which Joan had won we camped; for night was coming on.
Joan sent a summons to the English, promising that if they surrenderedshe would allow them to go in peace and take their horses with them.Nobody knew that she could take that strong place, but she knew it --knewit well; yet she offered that grace--offered it in a time when such athing was unknown in war; in a time when it was custom and usage tomassacre the garrison and the inhabitants of captured cities without pityor compunction--yes, even to the harmless women and children sometimes.There are neighbors all about you who well remember the unspeakableatrocities which Charles the Bold inflicted upon the men and women andchildren of Dinant when he took that place some years ago. It was aunique and kindly grace which Joan offered that garrison; but that washer way, that was her loving and merciful nature--she always did her bestto save her enemy's life and his soldierly pride when she had the masteryof him.
The English asked fifteen days' armistice to consider the proposal in.And Fastolfe coming with five thousand men! Joan said no. But she offeredanother grace: they might take both their horses and their side-arms--butthey must go within the hour.
Well, those bronzed English veterans were pretty hard-headed folk. Theydeclined again. Then Joan gave command that her army be made ready tomove to the assault at nine in the morning. Considering the deal ofmarching and fighting which the men had done that day, D'Alencon thoughtthe hour rather early; but Joan said it was best so, and so must beobeyed. Then she burst out with one of those enthusiasms which werealways burning in her when battle was imminent, and said:
"Work! work! and God will work with us!"
Yes, one might say that her motto was "Work! stick to it; keep onworking!" for in war she never knew what indolence was. And whoever willtake that motto and live by it will likely to succeed. There's many a wayto win in this world, but none of them is worth much without good hardwork back out of it.
I think we should have lost our big Standard-Bearer that day, if ourbigger Dwarf had not been at hand to bring him out of the melee when hewas wounded. He was unconscious, and would have been trampled to death byour own horse, if the Dwarf had not promptly rescued him and haled him tothe rear and safety. He recovered, and was himself again after two orthree hours; and then he was happy and proud, and made the most of hiswound, and went swaggering around in his bandages showing off like aninnocent big-child--which was just what he was. He was prouder of beingwounded than a really modest person would be of being killed. But therewas no harm in his vanity, and nobody minded it. He said he was hit by astone from a catapult--a stone the size of a man's head. But the stonegrew, of course. Before he got through with it he was claiming that theenemy had flung a building at him.
"Let him alone," said Noel Rainguesson. "Don't interrupt his processes.To-morrow it will be a cathedral."
He said that privately. And, sure enough, to-morrow it was a cathedral. Inever saw anybody with such an abandoned imagination.
Joan was abroad at the crack of dawn, galloping here and there andyonder, examining the situation minutely, and choosing what sheconsidered the most effective positions for her artillery; and with suchaccurate judgment did she place her guns that her Lieutenant-General'sadmiration of it still survived in his memory when his testimony wastaken at the Rehabilitation, a quarter of a century later.
In this testimony the Duke d'Alencon said that at Jargeau that morning ofthe 12th of June she made her dispositions not like a novice, but "withthe sure and clear judgment of a trained general of twenty or thirtyyears' experience."
The veteran captains of the armies of France said she was great in war inall ways, but greatest of all in her genius for posting and handlingartillery.
Who taught the shepherd-girl to do these marvels--she who could not read,and had had no opportunity to study the complex arts of war? I do notknow any way to solve such a baffling riddle as that, there being noprecedent for it, nothing in history to compare it with and examine itby. For in history there is no great general, however gifted, who arrivedat success otherwise than through able teaching and hard study and someexperience. It is a riddle which will never be guessed. I think thesevast powers and capacities were born in her, and that she applied them byan intuition which could not err.
At eight o'clock all movement ceased, and with it all sounds, all noise.A mute expectancy reigned. The stillness was something awful --because itmeant so much. There was no air stirring. The flags on the towers andramparts hung straight down like tassels. Wherever one saw a person, thatperson had stopped what he was doing, and was in a waiting attitude, alistening attitude. We were on a commanding spot, clustered around Joan.Not far from us, on every hand, were the lanes and humble dwellings ofthese outlying suburbs. Many people were visible--all were listening, notone was moving. A man had placed a nail; he was about to fasten somethingwith it to the door-post of his shop--but he had stopped. There was hishand reaching up holding the nail; and there was his other hand n the actof striking with the hammer; but he had forgotten everything--his headwas turned aside listening. Even children unconsciously stopped in theirplay; I saw a little boy with his hoop-stick pointed slanting toward theground in the act of steering the hoop around the corner; and so he hadstopped and was listening--the hoop was rolling away, doing its ownsteering. I saw a young girl prettily framed in an open window, awatering-pot in her hand and window-boxes of red flowers under itsspout--but the water had ceased to flow; the girl was listening.Everywhere were these impressive petrified forms; and everywhere wassuspended movement and that awful stillness.
Joan of Arc raised her sword in the air. At the signal, the silence wastorn to rags; cannon after cannon vomited flames and smoke and deliveredits quaking thunders; and we saw answering tongues of fire dart from thetowers and walls of the city, accompanied by answering deep thunders, andin a minute the walls and the towers disappeared, and in their placestood vast banks and pyramids of snowy smoke, motionless in the dead air.The startled girl dropped her watering-pot and clasped her handstogether, and at that moment a stone cannon-ball crashed through her fairbody.
The great artillery duel went on, each side hammering away with all itsmight; and it was splendid for smoke and noise, and most exalting toone's spirits. The poor little town around about us suffered cruelly. Thecannon-balls tore through its slight buildings, wrecking them as if theyhad been built of cards; and every moment or two one would see a hugerock come curving through the upper air above the smoke-clouds and goplunging down through the roofs. Fire broke out, and columns of flame andsmoke rose toward the sky.
Presently the artillery concussions changed the weather. The sky becameovercast, and a strong wind rose and blew away the smoke that hid theEnglish fortresses.
Then the spectacle was fine; turreted gray walls and towers, andstreaming bright flags, and jets of red fire and gushes of white smoke inlong rows, all standing out with sharp vividness against the deep leadenbackground of the sky; and then the whizzing missiles began to knock upthe dirt all around us, and I felt no more interest in the scenery. Therewas one English gun that was getting our position down finer and finerall the time. Presently Joan pointed to it and said:
"Fair duke, step out of your tracks, or that machine will kill you."
The Duke d'Alencon did as he was bid; but Monsieur du Lude rashly tookhis place, and that cannon tore his head off in a moment.
Joan was watching all along for the right time to order the assault. Atlast, about nine o'clock, she cried out:
"Now--to the assault!" and the buglers blew the charge.
Instantly we saw the body of men that had been appointed to this servicemove forward toward a point where the concentrated fire of our guns hadcrumbled the upper half of a broad stretch of wall to ruins; we saw thisforce descend into the ditch and begin to plant the scaling-ladders. Wewere soon with them. The Lieutenant-General thought the assaultpremature. But Joan said:
"Ah, gentle duke, are you afraid? Do you not know that I have promised tosend you home safe?"
It was warm work in the ditches. The walls were crowded with men, andthey poured avalanches of stones down upon us. There was one giganticEnglishman who did us more hurt than any dozen of his brethren. He alwaysdominated the places easiest of assault, and flung down exceedinglytroublesome big stones which smashed men and ladders both --then he wouldnear burst himself with laughing over what he had done. But the dukesettled accounts with him. He went and found the famous cannoneer, Jeanle Lorrain, and said:
"Train your gun--kill me this demon."
He did it with the first shot. He hit the Englishman fair in the breastand knocked him backward into the city.
The enemy's resistance was so effective and so stubborn that our peoplebegan to show signs of doubt and dismay. Seeing this, Joan raised herinspiring battle-cry and descended into the fosse herself, the Dwarfhelping her and the Paladin sticking bravely at her side with thestandard. She started up a scaling-ladder, but a great stone flung fromabove came crashing down upon her helmet and stretched her, wounded andstunned, upon the ground. But only for a moment. The Dwarf stood her uponher feet, and straightway she started up the ladder again, crying:
"To the assault, friends, to the assault--the English are ours! It is theappointed hour!"
There was a grand rush, and a fierce roar of war-cries, and we swarmedover the ramparts like ants. The garrison fled, we pursued; Jargeau wasours!
The Earl of Suffolk was hemmed in and surrounded, and the Duke d'Alenconand the Bastard of Orleans demanded that he surrender himself. But he wasa proud nobleman and came of a proud race. He refused to yield his swordto subordinates, saying:
"I will die rather. I will surrender to the Maid of Orleans alone, and tono other."
And so he did; and was courteously and honorably used by her.
His two brothers retreated, fighting step by step, toward the bridge, wepressing their despairing forces and cutting them down by scores. Arrivedon the bridge, the slaughter still continued. Alexander de la Pole waspushed overboard or fell over, and was drowned. Eleven hundred men hadfallen; John de la Pole decided to give up the struggle. But he wasnearly as proud and particular as his brother of Suffolk as to whom hewould surrender to. The French officer nearest at hand was GuillaumeRenault, who was pressing him closely. Sir John said to him:
"Are you a gentleman?"
"Yes."
"And a knight?"
"No."
Then Sir John knighted him himself there on the bridge, giving him theaccolade with English coolness and tranquillity in the midst of thatstorm of slaughter and mutilation; and then bowing with high courtesytook the sword by the blade and laid the hilt of it in the man's hand intoken of surrender. Ah, yes, a proud tribe, those De la Poles.
It was a grand day, a memorable day, a most splendid victory. We had acrowd of prisoners, but Joan would not allow them to be hurt. We tookthem with us and marched into Orleans next day through the usual tempestof welcome and joy.
And this time there was a new tribute to our leader. From everywhere inthe packed streets the new recruits squeezed their way to her side totouch the sword of Joan of Arc and draw from it somewhat of that
