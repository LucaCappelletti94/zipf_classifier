What the English Answered
SHE WAS ready, but must sit down and wait until there was an army to workwith.
Next morning, Saturday, April 30, 1429, she set about inquiring after themessenger who carried her proclamation to the English from Blois--the onewhich she had dictated at Poitiers. Here is a copy of it. It is aremarkable document, for several reasons: for its matter-of-factdirectness, for its high spirit and forcible diction, and for its naiveconfidence in her ability to achieve the prodigious task which she hadlaid upon herself, or which had been laid upon her--which you please. Allthrough it you seem to see the pomps of war and hear the rumbling of thedrums. In it Joan's warrior soul is revealed, and for the moment the softlittle shepherdess has disappeared from your view. This untaughtcountry-damsel, unused to dictating anything at all to anybody, much lessdocuments of state to kings and generals, poured out this procession ofvigorous sentences as fluently as if this sort of work had been her tradefrom childhood:
JESUS MARIA King of England and you Duke of Bedford who call yourselfRegent of France; William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk; and you ThomasLord Scales, who style yourselves lieutenants of the said Bedford--doright to the King of Heaven. Render to the Maid who is sent by God thekeys of all the good towns you have taken and violated in France. She issent hither by God, to restore the blood royal. She is very ready to makepeace if you will do her right by giving up France and paying for whatyou have held. And you archers, companions of war, noble and otherwise,who are before the good city of Orleans, begone into your own land inGod's name, or expect news from the Maid who will shortly go to see youto your very great hurt. King of England, if you do not so, I am chief ofwar, and whenever I shall find your people in France, I will drive themout, willing or not willing; and if they do not obey I will slay themall, but if they obey, I will have them to mercy. I am come hither byGod, the King of Heaven, body for body, to put you our of France, inspite of those who would work treason and mischief against the kingdom.Think not you shall ever hold the kingdom from the King of Heaven, theSon of the Blessed Mary; King Charles shall hold it, for God wills it so,and has revealed it to him by the Maid. If you believe not the news sentby God through the Maid, wherever we shall met you we will strike boldlyand make such a noise as has not been in France these thousand years. Besure that God can send more strength to the Maid than you can bring toany assault against her and her good men-at-arms; and then we shall seewho has the better right, the King of Heaven, or you. Duke of Bedford,the Maid prays you not to bring about your own destruction. If you do herright, you may yet go in her company where the French shall do the finestdeed that has been done in Christendom, and if you do not, you shall bereminded shortly of your great wrongs.
In that closing sentence she invites them to go on crusade with her torescue the Holy Sepulcher. No answer had been returned to thisproclamation, and the messenger himself had not come back.
So now she sent her two heralds with a new letter warning the English toraise the siege and requiring them to restore that missing messenger. Theheralds came back without him. All they brought was notice from theEnglish to Joan that they would presently catch her and burn her if shedid not clear out now while she had a chance, and "go back to her propertrade of minding cows."
She held her peace, only saying it was a pity that the English wouldpersist in inviting present disaster and eventual destruction when shewas "doing all she could to get them out of the country with their livesstill in their bodies."
Presently she thought of an arrangement that might be acceptable, andsaid to the heralds, "Go back and say to Lord Talbot this, from me: 'Comeout of your bastilles with your host, and I will come with mine; if Ibeat you, go in peace out of France; if you beat me, burn me, accordingto your desire.'"
I did not hear this, but Dunois did, and spoke of it. The challenge wasrefused.
Sunday morning her Voices or some instinct gave her a warning, and shesent Dunois to Blois to take command of the army and hurry it to Orleans.It was a wise move, for he found Regnault de Chartres and some more ofthe King's pet rascals there trying their best to disperse the army, andcrippling all the efforts of Joan's generals to head it for Orleans. Theywere a fine lot, those miscreants. They turned their attention to Dunoisnow, but he had balked Joan once, with unpleasant results to himself, andwas not minded to meddle in that way again. He soon had the army moving.
