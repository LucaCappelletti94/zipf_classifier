A dozen direct censures are easier to bear than one morganaticcompliment. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

Sailed from Honolulu.--From diary:
Sept. 2.  Flocks of flying fish-slim, shapely, graceful, and intenselywhite.  With the sun on them they look like a flight of silverfruit-knives.  They are able to fly a hundred yards.
Sept. 3.  In 9 deg. 50' north latitude, at breakfast.  Approaching theequator on a long slant.  Those of us who have never seen the equator area good deal excited.  I think I would rather see it than any other thingin the world.  We entered the "doldrums" last night--variable winds,bursts of rain, intervals of calm, with chopping seas and a wobbly anddrunken motion to the ship--a condition of things findable inother regions sometimes, but present in the doldrums always.  Theglobe-girdling belt called the doldrums is 20 degrees wide, and thethread called the equator lies along the middle of it.
Sept. 4.  Total eclipse of the moon last night.  At 1.30 it began to gooff.  At total--or about that--it was like a rich rosy cloud with atumbled surface framed in the circle and projecting from it--a bulge ofstrawberry-ice, so to speak.  At half-eclipse the moon was like a gildedacorn in its cup.
Sept. 5.  Closing in on the equator this noon.  A sailor explained to ayoung girl that the ship's speed is poor because we are climbing up thebulge toward the center of the globe; but that when we should once getover, at the equator, and start down-hill, we should fly.  When she askedhim the other day what the fore-yard was, he said it was the front yard,the open area in the front end of the ship.  That man has a good deal oflearning stored up, and the girl is likely to get it all.
Afternoon.  Crossed the equator.  In the distance it looked like a blueribbon stretched across the ocean.  Several passengers kodak'd it.  Wehad no fool ceremonies, no fantastics, no horse play.  All that sort ofthing has gone out.  In old times a sailor, dressed as Neptune, used tocome in over the bows, with his suite, and lather up and shave everybodywho was crossing the equator for the first time, and then cleanse theseunfortunates by swinging them from the yard-arm and ducking them threetimes in the sea. This was considered funny.  Nobody knows why.  No, thatis not true.  We do know why.  Such a thing could never be funny on land;no part of the old-time grotesque performances gotten up on shipboard tocelebrate the passage of the line would ever be funny on shore--theywould seem dreary and less to shore people.  But the shore people wouldchange their minds about it at sea, on a long voyage.  On such a voyage,with its eternal monotonies, people's intellects deteriorate; the ownersof the intellects soon reach a point where they almost seem to preferchildish things to things of a maturer degree.  One is often surprised atthe juvenilities which grown people indulge in at sea, and the interestthey take in them, and the consuming enjoyment they get out of them.This is on long voyages only.  The mind gradually becomes inert, dull,blunted; it loses its accustomed interest in intellectual things; nothingbut horse-play can rouse it, nothing but wild and foolish grotesqueriescan entertain it.  On short voyages it makes no such exposure of itself;it hasn't time to slump down to this sorrowful level.
The short-voyage passenger gets his chief physical exercise out of"horse-billiards"--shovel-board.  It is a good game.  We play it in thisship.  A quartermaster chalks off a diagram like this-on the deck.
The player uses a cue that is like a broom-handle with a quarter-moon ofwood fastened to the end of it.  With this he shoves wooden disks thesize of a saucer--he gives the disk a vigorous shove and sends it fifteenor twenty feet along the deck and lands it in one of the squares if hecan.  If it stays there till the inning is played out, it will count asmany points in the game as the figure in the square it has stopped inrepresents.  The adversary plays to knock that disk out and leave his ownin its place--particularly if it rests upon the 9 or 10 or some other ofthe high numbers; but if it rests in the "10off" he backs it up--landshis disk behind it a foot or two, to make it difficult for its owner toknock it out of that damaging place and improve his record.  When theinning is played out it may be found that each adversary has placed hisfour disks where they count; it may be found that some of them aretouching chalk lines and not counting; and very often it will be foundthat there has been a general wreckage, and that not a disk has been leftwithin the diagram.  Anyway, the result is recorded, whatever it is, andthe game goes on.  The game is 100 points, and it takes from twentyminutes to forty to play it, according to luck and the condition of thesea.  It is an exciting game, and the crowd of spectators furnishabundance of applause for fortunate shots and plenty of laughter for theother kind.  It is a game of skill, but at the same time the uneasymotion of the ship is constantly interfering with skill; this makes it achancy game, and the element of luck comes largely in.
We had a couple of grand tournaments, to determine who should be"Champion of the Pacific"; they included among the participants nearlyall the passengers, of both sexes, and the officers of the ship, and theyafforded many days of stupendous interest and excitement, and murderousexercise--for horse-billiards is a physically violent game.
The figures in the following record of some of the closing games in thefirst tournament will show, better than any description, how very chancythe game is.  The losers here represented had all been winners in theprevious games of the series, some of them by fine majorities:
Chase,102      Mrs.  D.,57    Mortimer, 105  The Surgeon, 92Miss C.,105    Mrs.  T.,9     Clemens, 101   Taylor,92Taylor,109     Davies,95      Miss C., 108   Mortimer,55Thomas,102     Roper,76       Clemens, 111   Miss C.,89Coomber, 106   Chase,98
And so on; until but three couples of winners were left.  Then I beat myman, young Smith beat his man, and Thomas beat his.  This reduced thecombatants to three.  Smith and I took the deck, and I led off.  At theclose of the first inning I was 10 worse than nothing and Smith hadscored 7.  The luck continued against me.  When I was 57, Smith was 97--within 3 of out.  The luck changed then.  He picked up a 10-off or so,and couldn't recover.  I beat him.
The next game would end tournament No. 1.
Mr. Thomas and I were the contestants.  He won the lead and went to thebat--so to speak.  And there he stood, with the crotch of his cue restingagainst his disk while the ship rose slowly up, sank slowly down, roseagain, sank again.  She never seemed to rise to suit him exactly.  Shestarted up once more; and when she was nearly ready for the turn, he letdrive and landed his disk just within the left-hand end of the 10.(Applause).  The umpire proclaimed "a good 10," and the game-keeper setit down.  I played: my disk grazed the edge of Mr. Thomas's disk, andwent out of the diagram.  (No applause.)
Mr. Thomas played again--and landed his second disk alongside of thefirst, and almost touching its right-hand side.  "Good 10." (Greatapplause.)
I played, and missed both of them.  (No applause.)
Mr. Thomas delivered his third shot and landed his disk just at the rightof the other two.  "Good 10." (Immense applause.)
There they lay, side by side, the three in a row.  It did not seempossible that anybody could miss them.  Still I did it.  (Immensesilence.)
Mr. Thomas played his last disk.  It seems incredible, but he actuallylanded that disk alongside of the others, and just to the right of them-astraight solid row of 4 disks.  (Tumultuous and long-continued applause.)
Then I played my last disk.  Again it did not seem possible that anybodycould miss that row--a row which would have been 14 inches long if thedisks had been clamped together; whereas, with the spaces separating themthey made a longer row than that.  But I did it.  It may be that I wasgetting nervous.
I think it unlikely that that innings has ever had its parallel in thehistory of horse-billiards.  To place the four disks side by side in the10 was an extraordinary feat; indeed, it was a kind of miracle.  To missthem was another miracle.  It will take a century to produce another manwho can place the four disks in the 10; and longer than that to find aman who can't knock them out.  I was ashamed of my performance at thetime, but now that I reflect upon it I see that it was rather fine anddifficult.
Mr. Thomas kept his luck, and won the game, and later the championship.
In a minor tournament I won the prize, which was a Waterbury watch.  Iput it in my trunk.  In Pretoria, South Africa, nine months afterward, myproper watch broke down and I took the Waterbury out, wound it, set it bythe great clock on the Parliament House (8.05), then went back to my roomand went to bed, tired from a long railway journey.  The parliamentaryclock had a peculiarity which I was not aware of at the time--a peculiarity which exists in no other clock, and would not exist in thatone if it had been made by a sane person; on the half-hour it strikes thesucceeding hour, then strikes the hour again, at the proper time.  I layreading and smoking awhile; then, when I could hold my eyes open nolonger and was about to put out the light, the great clock began to boom,and I counted ten.  I reached for the Waterbury to see how it was gettingalong.  It was marking 9.30.  It seemed rather poor speed for athree-dollar watch, but I supposed that the climate was affecting it.  Ishoved it half an hour ahead; and took to my book and waited to see whatwould happen.  At 10 the great clock struck ten again.  I looked--theWaterbury was marking half-past 10.  This was too much speed for themoney, and it troubled me.  I pushed the hands back a half hour, andwaited once more; I had to, for I was vexed and restless now, and mysleepiness was gone. By and by the great clock struck 11.  The Waterburywas marking 10.30.  I pushed it ahead half an hour, with some show oftemper.  By and by the great clock struck 11 again.  The Waterbury showedup 11.30, now, and I beat her brains out against the bedstead.  I wassorry next day, when I found out.
To return to the ship.
The average human being is a perverse creature; and when he isn't that,he is a practical joker.  The result to the other person concerned isabout the same: that is, he is made to suffer.  The washing down of thedecks begins at a very early hour in all ships; in but few ships are anymeasures taken to protect the passengers, either by waking or warningthem, or by sending a steward to close their ports.  And so thedeckwashers have their opportunity, and they use it.  They send a bucketof water slashing along the side of the ship and into the ports,drenching the passenger's clothes, and often the passenger himself.  Thisgood old custom prevailed in this ship, and under unusually favorablecircumstances, for in the blazing tropical regions a removable zinc thinglike a sugarshovel projects from the port to catch the wind and bring itin; this thing catches the wash-water and brings it in, too--and inflooding abundance.  Mrs. L, an invalid, had to sleep on the locker--sofaunder her port, and every time she over-slept and thus failed to takecare of herself, the deck-washers drowned her out.
And the painters, what a good time they had!  This ship would be goinginto dock for a month in Sydney for repairs; but no matter, painting wasgoing on all the time somewhere or other.  The ladies' dresses wereconstantly getting ruined, nevertheless protests and supplications wentfor nothing.  Sometimes a lady, taking an afternoon nap on deck near aventilator or some other thing that didn't need painting, would wake upby and by and find that the humorous painter had been noiselessly daubingthat thing and had splattered her white gown all over with little greasyyellow spots.
The blame for this untimely painting did not lie with the ship'sofficers, but with custom.  As far back as Noah's time it became law thatships must be constantly painted and fussed at when at sea; custom grewout of the law, and at sea custom knows no death; this custom willcontinue until the sea goes dry.
Sept. 8.--Sunday.  We are moving so nearly south that we cross only abouttwo meridians of longitude a day.  This morning we were in longitude 178west from Greenwich, and 57 degrees west from San Francisco.  To-morrowwe shall be close to the center of the globe--the 180th degree of westlongitude and 180th degree of east longitude.
And then we must drop out a day-lose a day out of our lives, a day neverto be found again.  We shall all die one day earlier than from thebeginning of time we were foreordained to die.  We shall be a daybehindhand all through eternity.  We shall always be saying to the otherangels, "Fine day today," and they will be always retorting, "But itisn't to-day, it's tomorrow." We shall be in a state of confusion all thetime and shall never know what true happiness is.
Next Day.  Sure enough, it has happened.  Yesterday it was September 8,Sunday; to-day, per the bulletin-board at the head of the companionway,it is September 10, Tuesday.  There is something uncanny about it.  Anduncomfortable.  In fact, nearly unthinkable, and wholly unrealizable,when one comes to consider it.  While we were crossing the 180th meridianit was Sunday in the stern of the ship where my family were, and Tuesdayin the bow where I was.  They were there eating the half of a fresh appleon the 8th, and I was at the same time eating the other half of it on the10th--and I could notice how stale it was, already.  The family were thesame age that they were when I had left them five minutes before, but Iwas a day older now than I was then.  The day they were living instretched behind them half way round the globe, across the Pacific Oceanand America and Europe; the day I was living in stretched in front of mearound the other half to meet it.  They were stupendous days for bulk andstretch; apparently much larger days than we had ever been in before.All previous days had been but shrunk-up little things by comparison.The difference in temperature between the two days was very marked, theirday being hotter than mine because it was closer to the equator.
Along about the moment that we were crossing the Great Meridian a childwas born in the steerage, and now there is no way to tell which day itwas born on.  The nurse thinks it was Sunday, the surgeon thinks it wasTuesday.  The child will never know its own birthday.  It will always bechoosing first one and then the other, and will never be able to make upits mind permanently.  This will breed vacillation and uncertainty in itsopinions about religion, and politics, and business, and sweethearts, andeverything, and will undermine its principles, and rot them away, andmake the poor thing characterless, and its success in life impossible.Every one in the ship says so.  And this is not all--in fact, not theworst.  For there is an enormously rich brewer in the ship who said asmuch as ten days ago, that if the child was born on his birthday he wouldgive it ten thousand dollars to start its little life with.  His birthdaywas Monday, the 9th of September.
If the ships all moved in the one direction--westward, I mean--the worldwould suffer a prodigious loss--in the matter of valuable time, throughthe dumping overboard on the Great Meridian of such multitudes of days byships crews and passengers.  But fortunately the ships do not all sailwest, half of them sail east.  So there is no real loss.  These latterpick up all the discarded days and add them to the world's stock again;and about as good as new, too; for of course the salt water preservesthem.
