"Too much company for her, Marse Tom.  Betwixt you, and Shekels,the Colonel's wife, and the Cid - "
"The Cid?  Oh, I remember - the raven."
 " - and Mrs. Captain Marsh and Famine and Pestilence the babyCOYOTES, and Sour-Mash and her pups, and Sardanapalus and herkittens - hang these names she gives the creatures, they warp myjaw - and Potter:   you - all sitting around in the house, andSoldier Boy at the window the entire time, it's a wonder to me shecomes along as well as she does.  She - "
"You want her all to yourself, you stingy old thing!"
"Marse Tom, you know better.  It's too much company.  And then theidea of her receiving reports all the time from her officers, andacting upon them, and giving orders, the same as if she was well!It ain't good for her, and the surgeon don't like it, and tried topersuade her not to and couldn't; and when he ORDERED her, she wasthat outraged and indignant, and was very severe on him, andaccused him of insubordination, and said it didn't become him togive orders to an officer of her rank.  Well, he saw he had excitedher more and done more harm than all the rest put together, so hewas vexed at himself and wished he had kept still.  Doctors DON'Tknow much, and that's a fact.  She's too much interested in things- she ought to rest more.  She's all the time sending messages toBB, and to soldiers and Injuns and whatnot, and to the animals."
"To the animals?"
"Yes, sir."
"Who carries them?"
"Sometimes Potter, but mostly it's Shekels."
"Now come! who can find fault with such pretty make-believe asthat?"
"But it ain't make-believe, Marse Tom.  She does send them."
"Yes, I don't doubt that part of it."
"Do you doubt they get them, sir?"
"Certainly.  Don't you?"
"No, sir.  Animals talk to one another.  I know it perfectly well,Marse Tom, and I ain't saying it by guess."
"What a curious superstition!"
"It ain't a superstition, Marse Tom.  Look at that Shekels - lookat him, NOW.  Is he listening, or ain't he?  NOW you see! he'sturned his head away.  It's because he was caught - caught in theact.  I'll ask you - could a Christian look any more ashamed thanwhat he looks now? - LAY DOWN!  You see? he was going to sneak out.Don't tell ME, Marse Tom!  If animals don't talk, I miss MY guess.And Shekels is the worst.  He goes and tells the animals everythingthat happens in the officers' quarters; and if he's short of facts,he invents them.  He hasn't any more principle than a blue jay; andas for morals, he's empty.  Look at him now; look at him grovel.He knows what I am saying, and he knows it's the truth.  You see,yourself, that he can feel shame; it's the only virtue he's got.It's wonderful how they find out everything that's going on - theanimals.  They - "
"Do you really believe they do, Dorcas?"
"I don't only just believe it, Marse Tom, I know it.  Day beforeyesterday they knew something was going to happen.  They were thatexcited, and whispering around together; why, anybody could seethat they -  But my! I must get back to her, and I haven't got tomy errand yet."
"What is it, Dorcas?"
"Well, it's two or three things.  One is, the doctor don't salutewhen he comes . . . Now, Marse Tom, it ain't anything to laugh at,and so - "
"Well, then, forgive me; I didn't mean to laugh - I got caughtunprepared."
"You see, she don't want to hurt the doctor's feelings, so shedon't say anything to him about it; but she is always polite,herself, and it hurts that kind for people to be rude to them."
"I'll have that doctor hanged."
"Marse Tom, she don't WANT him hanged.  She - "
"Well, then, I'll have him boiled in oil."
"But she don't WANT him boiled.  I - "
"Oh, very well, very well, I only want to please her; I'll have himskinned."
"Why, SHE don't want him skinned; it would break her heart.  Now -"
"Woman, this is perfectly unreasonable.  What in the nation DOESshe want?"
"Marse Tom, if you would only be a little patient, and not fly offthe handle at the least little thing.  Why, she only wants you tospeak to him."
"Speak to him!  Well, upon my word!  All this unseemly rage and rowabout such a - a -  Dorcas, I never saw you carry on like thisbefore.  You have alarmed the sentry; he thinks I am beingassassinated; he thinks there's a mutiny, a revolt, aninsurrection; he - "
"Marse Tom, you are just putting on; you know it perfectly well; Idon't know what makes you act like that - but you always did, evenwhen you was little, and you can't get over it, I reckon.  Are youover it now, Marse Tom?"
"Oh, well, yes; but it would try anybody to be doing the best hecould, offering every kindness he could think of, only to have itrejected with contumely and . . . Oh, well, let it go; it's nomatter - I'll talk to the doctor.  Is that satisfactory, or are yougoing to break out again?"
"Yes, sir, it is; and it's only right to talk to him, too, becauseit's just as she says; she's trying to keep up discipline in theRangers, and this insubordination of his is a bad example for them- now ain't it so, Marse Tom?"
"Well, there IS reason in it, I can't deny it; so I will speak tohim, though at bottom I think hanging would be more lasting.  Whatis the rest of your errand, Dorcas?"
"Of course her room is Ranger headquarters now, Marse Tom, whileshe's sick.  Well, soldiers of the cavalry and the dragoons thatare off duty come and get her sentries to let them relieve them andserve in their place.  It's only out of affection, sir, and becausethey know military honors please her, and please the children too,for her sake; and they don't bring their muskets; and so - "
"I've noticed them there, but didn't twig the idea.  They arestanding guard, are they?"
"Yes, sir, and she is afraid you will reprove them and hurt theirfeelings, if you see them there; so she begs, if - if you don'tmind coming in the back way - "
"Bear me up, Dorcas; don't let me faint."
"There - sit up and behave, Marse Tom.  You are not going to faint;you are only pretending - you used to act just so when you waslittle; it does seem a long time for you to get grown up."
"Dorcas, the way the child is progressing, I shall be out of my jobbefore long - she'll have the whole post in her hands.  I must makea stand, I must not go down without a struggle.  Theseencroachments. . . . Dorcas, what do you think she will think ofnext?"
"Marse Tom, she don't mean any harm."
"Are you sure of it?"
"Yes, Marse Tom."
"You feel sure she has no ulterior designs?"
"I don't know what that is, Marse Tom, but I know she hasn't."
"Very well, then, for the present I am satisfied.  What else haveyou come about?"
"I reckon I better tell you the whole thing first, Marse Tom, thentell you what she wants.  There's been an emeute, as she calls it.It was before she got back with BB.  The officer of the dayreported it to her this morning.  It happened at her fort.  Therewas a fuss betwixt Major-General Tommy Drake and Lieutenant-ColonelAgnes Frisbie, and he snatched her doll away, which is made ofwhite kid stuffed with sawdust, and tore every rag of its clothesoff, right before them all, and is under arrest, and the charge isconduct un - "
"Yes, I know - conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman - aplain case, too, it seems to me.  This is a serious matter.  Well,what is her pleasure?"
"Well, Marse Tom, she has summoned a court-martial, but the doctordon't think she is well enough to preside over it, and she saysthere ain't anybody competent but her, because there's a major-general concerned; and so she - she - well, she says, would youpreside over it for her? . . . Marse Tom, SIT up!  You ain't anymore going to faint than Shekels is."
"Look here, Dorcas, go along back, and be tactful.  Be persuasive;don't fret her; tell her it's all right, the matter is in my hands,but it isn't good form to hurry so grave a matter as this.  Explainto her that we have to go by precedents, and that I believe thisone to be new.  In fact, you can say I know that nothing just likeit has happened in our army, therefore I must be guided by Europeanprecedents, and must go cautiously and examine them carefully.Tell her not to be impatient, it will take me several days, but itwill all come out right, and I will come over and report progressas I go along.  Do you get the idea, Dorcas?"
"I don't know as I do, sir."
"Well, it's this.  You see, it won't ever do for me, a brigadier inthe regular army, to preside over that infant court-martial - thereisn't any precedent for it, don't you see.  Very well.  I will goon examining authorities and reporting progress until she is wellenough to get me out of this scrape by presiding herself.  Do youget it now?"
"Oh, yes, sir, I get it, and it's good, I'll go and fix it withher.  LAY DOWN! and stay where you are."
"Why, what harm is he doing?"
"Oh, it ain't any harm, but it just vexes me to see him act so."
"What was he doing?"
"Can't you see, and him in such a sweat?  He was starting out tospread it all over the post.  NOW I reckon you won't deny, anymore, that they go and tell everything they hear, now that you'veseen it with yo' own eyes."
"Well, I don't like to acknowledge it, Dorcas, but I don't see howI can consistently stick to my doubts in the face of suchoverwhelming proof as this dog is furnishing."
"There, now, you've got in yo' right mind at last!  I wonder youcan be so stubborn, Marse Tom.  But you always was, even when youwas little.  I'm going now."
"Look here; tell her that in view of the delay, it is my judgmentthat she ought to enlarge the accused on his parole."
"Yes, sir, I'll tell her.  Marse Tom?"
"Well?"
"She can't get to Soldier Boy, and he stands there all the time,down in the mouth and lonesome; and she says will you shake handswith him and comfort him?  Everybody does."
"It's a curious kind of lonesomeness; but, all right, I will."
