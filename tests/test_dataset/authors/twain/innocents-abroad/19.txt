"Do you wis zo haut can be?"
That was what the guide asked when we were looking up at the bronzehorses on the Arch of Peace. It meant, do you wish to go up there?I give it as a specimen of guide-English. These are the people that makelife a burthen to the tourist. Their tongues are never still. They talkforever and forever, and that is the kind of billingsgate they use.Inspiration itself could hardly comprehend them. If they would only showyou a masterpiece of art, or a venerable tomb, or a prison-house, or abattle-field, hallowed by touching memories or historical reminiscences,or grand traditions, and then step aside and hold still for ten minutesand let you think, it would not be so bad. But they interrupt everydream, every pleasant train of thought, with their tiresome cackling.Sometimes when I have been standing before some cherished old idol ofmine that I remembered years and years ago in pictures in the geographyat school, I have thought I would give a whole world if the human parrotat my side would suddenly perish where he stood and leave me to gaze, andponder, and worship.
No, we did not "wis zo haut can be." We wished to go to La Scala, thelargest theater in the world, I think they call it. We did so. It was alarge place. Seven separate and distinct masses of humanity--six greatcircles and a monster parquette.
We wished to go to the Ambrosian Library, and we did that also. We saw amanuscript of Virgil, with annotations in the handwriting of Petrarch,the gentleman who loved another man's Laura, and lavished upon her allthrough life a love which was a clear waste of the raw material. It wassound sentiment, but bad judgment. It brought both parties fame, andcreated a fountain of commiseration for them in sentimental breasts thatis running yet. But who says a word in behalf of poor Mr. Laura? (I donot know his other name.) Who glorifies him? Who bedews him with tears?Who writes poetry about him? Nobody. How do you suppose he liked thestate of things that has given the world so much pleasure? How did heenjoy having another man following his wife every where and making hername a familiar word in every garlic-exterminating mouth in Italy withhis sonnets to her pre-empted eyebrows? They got fame and sympathy--hegot neither. This is a peculiarly felicitous instance of what is calledpoetical justice. It is all very fine; but it does not chime with mynotions of right. It is too one-sided--too ungenerous.
Let the world go on fretting about Laura and Petrarch if it will; but asfor me, my tears and my lamentations shall be lavished upon the unsungdefendant.
We saw also an autograph letter of Lucrezia Borgia, a lady for whom Ihave always entertained the highest respect, on account of her rarehistrionic capabilities, her opulence in solid gold goblets made ofgilded wood, her high distinction as an operatic screamer, and thefacility with which she could order a sextuple funeral and get thecorpses ready for it. We saw one single coarse yellow hair fromLucrezia's head, likewise. It awoke emotions, but we still live. Inthis same library we saw some drawings by Michael Angelo (these Italianscall him Mickel Angelo,) and Leonardo da Vinci. (They spell it Vinci andpronounce it Vinchy; foreigners always spell better than they pronounce.)We reserve our opinion of these sketches.
In another building they showed us a fresco representing some lions andother beasts drawing chariots; and they seemed to project so far from thewall that we took them to be sculptures. The artist had shrewdlyheightened the delusion by painting dust on the creatures' backs, as ifit had fallen there naturally and properly. Smart fellow--if it be smartto deceive strangers.
Elsewhere we saw a huge Roman amphitheatre, with its stone seats still ingood preservation. Modernized, it is now the scene of more peacefulrecreations than the exhibition of a party of wild beasts with Christiansfor dinner. Part of the time, the Milanese use it for a race track, andat other seasons they flood it with water and have spirited yachtingregattas there. The guide told us these things, and he would hardly tryso hazardous an experiment as the telling of a falsehood, when it is allhe can do to speak the truth in English without getting the lock-jaw.
In another place we were shown a sort of summer arbor, with a fencebefore it. We said that was nothing. We looked again, and saw, throughthe arbor, an endless stretch of garden, and shrubbery, and grassy lawn.We were perfectly willing to go in there and rest, but it could not bedone. It was only another delusion--a painting by some ingenious artistwith little charity in his heart for tired folk. The deception wasperfect. No one could have imagined the park was not real. We eventhought we smelled the flowers at first.
We got a carriage at twilight and drove in the shaded avenues with theother nobility, and after dinner we took wine and ices in a fine gardenwith the great public. The music was excellent, the flowers andshrubbery were pleasant to the eye, the scene was vivacious, everybodywas genteel and well-behaved, and the ladies were slightly moustached,and handsomely dressed, but very homely.
We adjourned to a cafe and played billiards an hour, and I made six orseven points by the doctor pocketing his ball, and he made as many by mypocketing my ball. We came near making a carom sometimes, but not theone we were trying to make. The table was of the usual European style--cushions dead and twice as high as the balls; the cues in bad repair.The natives play only a sort of pool on them. We have never seen anybody playing the French three-ball game yet, and I doubt if there is anysuch game known in France, or that there lives any man mad enough to tryto play it on one of these European tables. We had to stop playingfinally because Dan got to sleeping fifteen minutes between the countsand paying no attention to his marking.
Afterward we walked up and down one of the most popular streets for sometime, enjoying other people's comfort and wishing we could export some ofit to our restless, driving, vitality-consuming marts at home. Just inthis one matter lies the main charm of life in Europe--comfort. InAmerica, we hurry--which is well; but when the day's work is done, we goon thinking of losses and gains, we plan for the morrow, we even carryour business cares to bed with us, and toss and worry over them when weought to be restoring our racked bodies and brains with sleep. We burnup our energies with these excitements, and either die early or drop intoa lean and mean old age at a time of life which they call a man's primein Europe. When an acre of ground has produced long and well, we let itlie fallow and rest for a season; we take no man clear across thecontinent in the same coach he started in--the coach is stabled somewhereon the plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool for a few days;when a razor has seen long service and refuses to hold an edge, thebarber lays it away for a few weeks, and the edge comes back of its ownaccord. We bestow thoughtful care upon inanimate objects, but none uponourselves. What a robust people, what a nation of thinkers we might be,if we would only lay ourselves on the shelf occasionally and renew ouredges!
I do envy these Europeans the comfort they take. When the work of theday is done, they forget it. Some of them go, with wife and children, toa beer hall and sit quietly and genteelly drinking a mug or two of aleand listening to music; others walk the streets, others drive in theavenues; others assemble in the great ornamental squares in the earlyevening to enjoy the sight and the fragrance of flowers and to hear themilitary bands play--no European city being without its fine militarymusic at eventide; and yet others of the populace sit in the open air infront of the refreshment houses and eat ices and drink mild beveragesthat could not harm a child. They go to bed moderately early, and sleepwell. They are always quiet, always orderly, always cheerful,comfortable, and appreciative of life and its manifold blessings. Onenever sees a drunken man among them. The change that has come over ourlittle party is surprising. Day by day we lose some of our restlessnessand absorb some of the spirit of quietude and ease that is in thetranquil atmosphere about us and in the demeanor of the people. We growwise apace. We begin to comprehend what life is for.
We have had a bath in Milan, in a public bath-house. They were going toput all three of us in one bath-tub, but we objected. Each of us had anItalian farm on his back. We could have felt affluent if we had beenofficially surveyed and fenced in. We chose to have three bathtubs, andlarge ones--tubs suited to the dignity of aristocrats who had realestate, and brought it with them. After we were stripped and had takenthe first chilly dash, we discovered that haunting atrocity that hasembittered our lives in so many cities and villages of Italy and France--there was no soap. I called. A woman answered, and I barely had time tothrow myself against the door--she would have been in, in another second.I said:
"Beware, woman! Go away from here--go away, now, or it will be the worsefor you. I am an unprotected male, but I will preserve my honor at theperil of my life!"
These words must have frightened her, for she skurried away very fast.
Dan's voice rose on the air:
"Oh, bring some soap, why don't you!"
The reply was Italian. Dan resumed:
"Soap, you know--soap. That is what I want--soap. S-o-a-p, soap;s-o-p-e, soap; s-o-u-p, soap. Hurry up! I don't know how you Irishspell it, but I want it. Spell it to suit yourself, but fetch it.I'm freezing."
I heard the doctor say impressively:
"Dan, how often have we told you that these foreigners cannot understandEnglish? Why will you not depend upon us? Why will you not tell us whatyou want, and let us ask for it in the language of the country? It wouldsave us a great deal of the humiliation your reprehensible ignorancecauses us. I will address this person in his mother tongue: 'Here,cospetto! corpo di Bacco! Sacramento! Solferino!--Soap, you son of agun!' Dan, if you would let us talk for you, you would never expose yourignorant vulgarity."
Even this fluent discharge of Italian did not bring the soap at once, butthere was a good reason for it. There was not such an article about theestablishment. It is my belief that there never had been. They had tosend far up town, and to several different places before they finally gotit, so they said. We had to wait twenty or thirty minutes. The samething had occurred the evening before, at the hotel. I think I havedivined the reason for this state of things at last. The English knowhow to travel comfortably, and they carry soap with them; otherforeigners do not use the article.
At every hotel we stop at we always have to send out for soap, at thelast moment, when we are grooming ourselves for dinner, and they put itin the bill along with the candles and other nonsense. In Marseillesthey make half the fancy toilet soap we consume in America, but theMarseillaise only have a vague theoretical idea of its use, which theyhave obtained from books of travel, just as they have acquired anuncertain notion of clean shirts, and the peculiarities of the gorilla,and other curious matters. This reminds me of poor Blucher's note to thelandlord in Paris:
 PARIS, le 7 Juillet. Monsieur le Landlord--Sir: Pourquoi don't you mettez some savon in your bed-chambers? Est-ce que vous pensez I will steal it? La nuit passee you charged me pour deux chandelles when I only had one; hier vous avez charged me avec glace when I had none at all; tout les jours you are coming some fresh game or other on me, mais vous ne pouvez pas play this savon dodge on me twice. Savon is a necessary de la vie to any body but a Frenchman, et je l'aurai hors de cet hotel or make trouble. You hear me. Allons. BLUCHER.
I remonstrated against the sending of this note, because it was so mixedup that the landlord would never be able to make head or tail of it; butBlucher said he guessed the old man could read the French of it andaverage the rest.
Blucher's French is bad enough, but it is not much worse than the Englishone finds in advertisements all over Italy every day. For instance,observe the printed card of the hotel we shall probably stop at on theshores of Lake Como:
 "NOTISH."
 "This hotel which the best it is in Italy and most superb, is handsome locate on the best situation of the lake, with the most splendid view near the Villas Melzy, to the King of Belgian, and Serbelloni. This hotel have recently enlarge, do offer all commodities on moderate price, at the strangers gentlemen who whish spend the seasons on the Lake Come."
How is that, for a specimen? In the hotel is a handsome little chapelwhere an English clergyman is employed to preach to such of the guests ofthe house as hail from England and America, and this fact is also setforth in barbarous English in the same advertisement. Wouldn't you havesupposed that the adventurous linguist who framed the card would haveknown enough to submit it to that clergyman before he sent it to theprinter?
Here in Milan, in an ancient tumble-down ruin of a church, is themournful wreck of the most celebrated painting in the world--"The LastSupper," by Leonardo da Vinci. We are not infallible judges of pictures,but of course we went there to see this wonderful painting, once sobeautiful, always so worshipped by masters in art, and forever to befamous in song and story. And the first thing that occurred was theinfliction on us of a placard fairly reeking with wretched English. Takea morsel of it: "Bartholomew (that is the first figure on the left handside at the spectator,) uncertain and doubtful about what he thinks tohave heard, and upon which he wants to be assured by himself at Christand by no others."
Good, isn't it? And then Peter is described as "argumenting in athreatening and angrily condition at Judas Iscariot."
This paragraph recalls the picture. "The Last Supper" is painted on thedilapidated wall of what was a little chapel attached to the main churchin ancient times, I suppose. It is battered and scarred in everydirection, and stained and discolored by time, and Napoleon's horseskicked the legs off most the disciples when they (the horses, not thedisciples,) were stabled there more than half a century ago.
I recognized the old picture in a moment--the Saviour with bowed headseated at the centre of a long, rough table with scattering fruits anddishes upon it, and six disciples on either side in their long robes,talking to each other--the picture from which all engravings and allcopies have been made for three centuries. Perhaps no living man hasever known an attempt to paint the Lord's Supper differently. The worldseems to have become settled in the belief, long ago, that it is notpossible for human genius to outdo this creation of da Vinci's. Isuppose painters will go on copying it as long as any of the original isleft visible to the eye. There were a dozen easels in the room, and asmany artists transferring the great picture to their canvases. Fiftyproofs of steel engravings and lithographs were scattered around, too.And as usual, I could not help noticing how superior the copies were tothe original, that is, to my inexperienced eye. Wherever you find aRaphael, a Rubens, a Michelangelo, a Carracci, or a da Vinci (and we seethem every day,) you find artists copying them, and the copies are alwaysthe handsomest. Maybe the originals were handsome when they were new,but they are not now.
This picture is about thirty feet long, and ten or twelve high, I shouldthink, and the figures are at least life size. It is one of the largestpaintings in Europe.
The colors are dimmed with age; the countenances are scaled and marred,and nearly all expression is gone from them; the hair is a dead blur uponthe wall, and there is no life in the eyes. Only the attitudes arecertain.
People come here from all parts of the world, and glorify thismasterpiece. They stand entranced before it with bated breath and partedlips, and when they speak, it is only in the catchy ejaculations ofrapture:
"Oh, wonderful!"
"Such expression!"
"Such grace of attitude!"
"Such dignity!"
"Such faultless drawing!"
"Such matchless coloring!"
"Such feeling!"
"What delicacy of touch!"
"What sublimity of conception!"
"A vision! A vision!"
I only envy these people; I envy them their honest admiration, if it behonest--their delight, if they feel delight. I harbor no animositytoward any of them. But at the same time the thought will intrude itselfupon me, How can they see what is not visible? What would you think of aman who looked at some decayed, blind, toothless, pock-marked Cleopatra,and said: "What matchless beauty! What soul! What expression!" Whatwould you think of a man who gazed upon a dingy, foggy sunset, and said:"What sublimity! What feeling! What richness of coloring!" What wouldyou think of a man who stared in ecstasy upon a desert of stumps andsaid: "Oh, my soul, my beating heart, what a noble forest is here!"
You would think that those men had an astonishing talent for seeingthings that had already passed away. It was what I thought when I stoodbefore "The Last Supper" and heard men apostrophizing wonders, andbeauties and perfections which had faded out of the picture and gone, ahundred years before they were born. We can imagine the beauty that wasonce in an aged face; we can imagine the forest if we see the stumps; butwe can not absolutely see these things when they are not there. I amwilling to believe that the eye of the practiced artist can rest upon theLast Supper and renew a lustre where only a hint of it is left, supply atint that has faded away, restore an expression that is gone; patch, andcolor, and add, to the dull canvas until at last its figures shall standbefore him aglow with the life, the feeling, the freshness, yea, with allthe noble beauty that was theirs when first they came from the hand ofthe master. But I can not work this miracle. Can those other uninspiredvisitors do it, or do they only happily imagine they do?
After reading so much about it, I am satisfied that the Last Supper was avery miracle of art once. But it was three hundred years ago.
It vexes me to hear people talk so glibly of "feeling," "expression,""tone," and those other easily acquired and inexpensive technicalities ofart that make such a fine show in conversations concerning pictures.There is not one man in seventy-five hundred that can tell what apictured face is intended to express. There is not one man in fivehundred that can go into a court-room and be sure that he will notmistake some harmless innocent of a juryman for the black-heartedassassin on trial. Yet such people talk of "character" and presume tointerpret "expression" in pictures. There is an old story that Matthews,the actor, was once lauding the ability of the human face to express thepassions and emotions hidden in the breast. He said the countenancecould disclose what was passing in the heart plainer than the tonguecould.
"Now," he said, "observe my face--what does it express?"
"Despair!"
"Bah, it expresses peaceful resignation! What does this express?"
"Rage!"
"Stuff! It means terror! This!"
"Imbecility!"
"Fool! It is smothered ferocity! Now this!"
"Joy!"
"Oh, perdition! Any ass can see it means insanity!"
Expression! People coolly pretend to read it who would think themselvespresumptuous if they pretended to interpret the hieroglyphics on theobelisks of Luxor--yet they are fully as competent to do the one thing asthe other. I have heard two very intelligent critics speak of Murillo'sImmaculate Conception (now in the museum at Seville,) within the past fewdays. One said:
"Oh, the Virgin's face is full of the ecstasy of a joy that is complete--that leaves nothing more to be desired on earth!"
The other said:
"Ah, that wonderful face is so humble, so pleading--it says as plainly aswords could say it: 'I fear; I tremble; I am unworthy. But Thy will bedone; sustain Thou Thy servant!'"
The reader can see the picture in any drawing-room; it can be easilyrecognized: the Virgin (the only young and really beautiful Virgin thatwas ever painted by one of the old masters, some of us think,) stands inthe crescent of the new moon, with a multitude of cherubs hovering abouther, and more coming; her hands are crossed upon her breast, and upon heruplifted countenance falls a glory out of the heavens. The reader mayamuse himself, if he chooses, in trying to determine which of thesegentlemen read the Virgin's "expression" aright, or if either of them didit.
Any one who is acquainted with the old masters will comprehend how much"The Last Supper" is damaged when I say that the spectator can not reallytell, now, whether the disciples are Hebrews or Italians. These ancientpainters never succeeded in denationalizing themselves. The Italianartists painted Italian Virgins, the Dutch painted Dutch Virgins, theVirgins of the French painters were Frenchwomen--none of them ever putinto the face of the Madonna that indescribable something which proclaimsthe Jewess, whether you find her in New York, in Constantinople, inParis, Jerusalem, or in the empire of Morocco. I saw in the SandwichIslands, once, a picture copied by a talented German artist from anengraving in one of the American illustrated papers. It was an allegory,representing Mr. Davis in the act of signing a secession act or some suchdocument. Over him hovered the ghost of Washington in warning attitude,and in the background a troop of shadowy soldiers in Continental uniformwere limping with shoeless, bandaged feet through a driving snow-storm.Valley Forge was suggested, of course. The copy seemed accurate, and yetthere was a discrepancy somewhere. After a long examination I discoveredwhat it was--the shadowy soldiers were all Germans! Jeff Davis was aGerman! even the hovering ghost was a German ghost! The artist hadunconsciously worked his nationality into the picture. To tell thetruth, I am getting a little perplexed about John the Baptist and hisportraits. In France I finally grew reconciled to him as a Frenchman;here he is unquestionably an Italian. What next? Can it be possiblethat the painters make John the Baptist a Spaniard in Madrid and anIrishman in Dublin?
We took an open barouche and drove two miles out of Milan to "see zeecho," as the guide expressed it. The road was smooth, it was borderedby trees, fields, and grassy meadows, and the soft air was filled withthe odor of flowers. Troops of picturesque peasant girls, coming fromwork, hooted at us, shouted at us, made all manner of game of us, andentirely delighted me. My long-cherished judgment was confirmed. Ialways did think those frowsy, romantic, unwashed peasant girls I hadread so much about in poetry were a glaring fraud.
We enjoyed our jaunt. It was an exhilarating relief from tiresomesight-seeing.
We distressed ourselves very little about the astonishing echo the guidetalked so much about. We were growing accustomed to encomiums on wondersthat too often proved no wonders at all. And so we were most happilydisappointed to find in the sequel that the guide had even failed to riseto the magnitude of his subject.
We arrived at a tumble-down old rookery called the Palazzo Simonetti--amassive hewn-stone affair occupied by a family of ragged Italians.A good-looking young girl conducted us to a window on the second floorwhich looked out on a court walled on three sides by tall buildings. Sheput her head out at the window and shouted. The echo answered more timesthan we could count. She took a speaking trumpet and through it sheshouted, sharp and quick, a single "Ha!" The echo answered:
"Ha!--ha!----ha!--ha!--ha!-ha! ha! h-a-a-a-a-a!" and finally went offinto a rollicking convulsion of the jolliest laughter that could beimagined. It was so joyful--so long continued--so perfectly cordial andhearty, that every body was forced to join in. There was no resistingit.
Then the girl took a gun and fired it. We stood ready to count theastonishing clatter of reverberations. We could not say one, two, three,fast enough, but we could dot our notebooks with our pencil points almostrapidly enough to take down a sort of short-hand report of the result.My page revealed the following account. I could not keep up, but I didas well as I could.
I set down fifty-two distinct repetitions, and then the echo got theadvantage of me. The doctor set down sixty-four, and thenceforth theecho moved too fast for him, also. After the separate concussions couldno longer be noted, the reverberations dwindled to a wild, long-sustainedclatter of sounds such as a watchman's rattle produces. It is likelythat this is the most remarkable echo in the world.
The doctor, in jest, offered to kiss the young girl, and was taken alittle aback when she said he might for a franc! The commonest gallantrycompelled him to stand by his offer, and so he paid the franc and tookthe kiss. She was a philosopher. She said a franc was a good thing tohave, and she did not care any thing for one paltry kiss, because she hada million left. Then our comrade, always a shrewd businessman, offeredto take the whole cargo at thirty days, but that little financial schemewas a failure.
