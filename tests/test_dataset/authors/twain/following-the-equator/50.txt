The man who is ostentatious of his modesty is twin to the statue thatwears a fig-leaf. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
The journey to Benares was all in daylight, and occupied but a few hours.It was admirably dusty. The dust settled upon you in a thick ashy layerand turned you into a fakeer, with nothing lacking to the role but thecow manure and the sense of holiness. There was a change of cars aboutmid-afternoon at Moghul-serai--if that was the name--and a wait of twohours there for the Benares train. We could have found a carriage anddriven to the sacred city, but we should have lost the wait. In othercountries a long wait at a station is a dull thing and tedious, but onehas no right to have that feeling in India. You have the monster crowdof bejeweled natives, the stir, the bustle, the confusion, the shiftingsplendors of the costumes--dear me, the delight of it, the charm of itare beyond speech. The two-hour wait was over too soon. Among othersatisfying things to look at was a minor native prince from the backwoodssomewhere, with his guard of honor, a ragged but wonderfully gaudy gangof fifty dark barbarians armed with rusty flint-lock muskets. Thegeneral show came so near to exhausting variety that one would have saidthat no addition to it could be conspicuous, but when this Falstaff andhis motleys marched through it one saw that that seeming impossibilityhad happened.
We got away by and by, and soon reached the outer edge of Benares; thenthere was another wait; but, as usual, with something to look at. Thiswas a cluster of little canvas-boxes--palanquins. A canvas-box is not muchof a sight--when empty; but when there is a lady in it, it is an objectof interest. These boxes were grouped apart, in the full blaze of theterrible sun during the three-quarters of an hour that we tarried there.They contained zenana ladies. They had to sit up; there was not roomenough to stretch out. They probably did not mind it. They are used tothe close captivity of the dwellings all their lives; when they go ajourney they are carried to the train in these boxes; in the train theyhave to be secluded from inspection. Many people pity them, and I alwaysdid it myself and never charged anything; but it is doubtful if thiscompassion is valued. While we were in India some good-hearted Europeansin one of the cities proposed to restrict a large park to the use ofzenana ladies, so that they could go there and in assured privacy goabout unveiled and enjoy the sunshine and air as they had never enjoyedthem before. The good intentions back of the proposition wererecognized, and sincere thanks returned for it, but the propositionitself met with a prompt declination at the hands of those who wereauthorized to speak for the zenana ladies. Apparently, the idea wasshocking to the ladies--indeed, it was quite manifestly shocking. Wasthat proposition the equivalent of inviting European ladies to assemblescantily and scandalously clothed in the seclusion of a private park? Itseemed to be about that.
Without doubt modesty is nothing less than a holy feeling; and withoutdoubt the person whose rule of modesty has been transgressed feels thesame sort of wound that he would feel if something made holy to him byhis religion had suffered a desecration. I say "rule of modesty" becausethere are about a million rules in the world, and this makes a millionstandards to be looked out for. Major Sleeman mentions the case of somehigh-caste veiled ladies who were profoundly scandalized when someEnglish young ladies passed by with faces bare to the world; soscandalized that they spoke out with strong indignation and wondered thatpeople could be so shameless as to expose their persons like that. Andyet "the legs of the objectors were naked to mid-thigh." Both partieswere clean-minded and irreproachably modest, while abiding by theirseparate rules, but they couldn't have traded rules for a change withoutsuffering considerable discomfort. All human rules are more or lessidiotic, I suppose. It is best so, no doubt. The way it is now, theasylums can hold the sane people, but if we tried to shut up the insanewe should run out of building materials.
You have a long drive through the outskirts of Benares before you get tothe hotel. And all the aspects are melancholy. It is a vision of dustysterility, decaying temples, crumbling tombs, broken mud walls, shabbyhuts. The whole region seems to ache with age and penury. It must taketen thousand years of want to produce such an aspect. We were stilloutside of the great native city when we reached the hotel. It was aquiet and homelike house, inviting, and manifestly comfortable. But weliked its annex better, and went thither. It was a mile away, perhaps,and stood in the midst of a large compound, and was built bungalowfashion, everything on the ground floor, and a veranda all around. Theyhave doors in India, but I don't know why. They don't fasten, and theystand open, as a rule, with a curtain hanging in the doorspace to keepout the glare of the sun. Still, there is plenty of privacy, for nowhite person will come in without notice, of course. The native menservants will, but they don't seem to count. They glide in, barefoot andnoiseless, and are in the midst before one knows it. At first this is ashock, and sometimes it is an embarrassment; but one has to get used toit, and does.
There was one tree in the compound, and a monkey lived in it. At first Iwas strongly interested in the tree, for I was told that it was therenowned peepul--the tree in whose shadow you cannot tell a lie. Thisone failed to stand the test, and I went away from it disappointed.There was a softly creaking well close by, and a couple of oxen drewwater from it by the hour, superintended by two natives dressed in theusual "turban and pocket-handkerchief." The tree and the well were theonly scenery, and so the compound was a soothing and lonesome andsatisfying place; and very restful after so many activities. There wasnobody in our bungalow but ourselves; the other guests were in the nextone, where the table d'hote was furnished. A body could not be morepleasantly situated. Each room had the customary bath attached--a roomten or twelve feet square, with a roomy stone-paved pit in it andabundance of water. One could not easily improve upon this arrangement,except by furnishing it with cold water and excluding the hot, indeference to the fervency of the climate; but that is forbidden. Itwould damage the bather's health. The stranger is warned against takingcold baths in India, but even the most intelligent strangers are fools,and they do not obey, and so they presently get laid up. I was the mostintelligent fool that passed through, that year. But I am still moreintelligent now. Now that it is too late.
I wonder if the 'dorian', if that is the name of it, is anothersuperstition, like the peepul tree. There was a great abundance andvariety of tropical fruits, but the dorian was never in evidence. It wasnever the season for the dorian. It was always going to arrive fromBurma sometime or other, but it never did. By all accounts it was a moststrange fruit, and incomparably delicious to the taste, but not to thesmell. Its rind was said to exude a stench of so atrocious a nature thatwhen a dorian was in the room even the presence of a polecat was arefreshment. We found many who had eaten the dorian, and they all spokeof it with a sort of rapture. They said that if you could hold your noseuntil the fruit was in your mouth a sacred joy would suffuse you fromhead to foot that would make you oblivious to the smell of the rind, butthat if your grip slipped and you caught the smell of the rind before thefruit was in your mouth, you would faint. There is a fortune in thatrind. Some day somebody will import it into Europe and sell it forcheese.
Benares was not a disappointment. It justified its reputation as acuriosity. It is on high ground, and overhangs a grand curve of theGanges. It is a vast mass of building, compactly crusting a hill, and iscloven in all directions by an intricate confusion of cracks which standfor streets. Tall, slim minarets and beflagged temple-spires rise out ofit and give it picturesqueness, viewed from the river. The city is asbusy as an ant-hill, and the hurly-burly of human life swarming along theweb of narrow streets reminds one of the ants. The sacred cow swarmsalong, too, and goes whither she pleases, and takes toll of thegrain-shops, and is very much in the way, and is a good deal of anuisance, since she must not be molested.
Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even thanlegend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together. From aHindoo statement quoted in Rev. Mr. Parker's compact and lucid Guide toBenares, I find that the site of the town was the beginning-place of theCreation. It was merely an upright "lingam," at first, no larger than astove-pipe, and stood in the midst of a shoreless ocean. This was thework of the God Vishnu. Later he spread the lingam out till its surfacewas ten miles across. Still it was not large enough for the business;therefore he presently built the globe around it. Benares is thus thecenter of the earth. This is considered an advantage.
It has had a tumultuous history, both materially and spiritually. Itstarted Brahminically, many ages ago; then by and by Buddha came inrecent times 2,500 years ago, and after that it was Buddhist during manycenturies--twelve, perhaps--but the Brahmins got the upper hand again,then, and have held it ever since. It is unspeakably sacred in Hindooeyes, and is as unsanitary as it is sacred, and smells like the rind ofthe dorian. It is the headquarters of the Brahmin faith, and one-eighthof the population are priests of that church. But it is not anoverstock, for they have all India as a prey. All India flocks thitheron pilgrimage, and pours its savings into the pockets of the priests in agenerous stream, which never fails. A priest with a good stand on theshore of the Ganges is much better off than the sweeper of the bestcrossing in London. A good stand is worth a world of money. The holyproprietor of it sits under his grand spectacular umbrella and blessespeople all his life, and collects his commission, and grows fat and rich;and the stand passes from father to son, down and down and down throughthe ages, and remains a permanent and lucrative estate in the family. AsMr. Parker suggests, it can become a subject of dispute, at one time oranother, and then the matter will be settled, not by prayer and fastingand consultations with Vishnu, but by the intervention of a much morepuissant power--an English court. In Bombay I was told by an Americanmissionary that in India there are 640 Protestant missionaries at work.At first it seemed an immense force, but of course that was a thoughtlessidea. One missionary to 500,000 natives--no, that is not a force; it isthe reverse of it; 640 marching against an intrenched camp of300,000,000--the odds are too great. A force of 640 in Benares alonewould have its hands over-full with 8,000 Brahmin priests for adversary.Missionaries need to be well equipped with hope and confidence, and thisequipment they seem to have always had in all parts of the world. Mr.Parker has it. It enables him to get a favorable outlook out ofstatistics which might add up differently with other mathematicians. Forinstance:
"During the past few years competent observers declare that the number ofpilgrims to Benares has increased."
And then he adds up this fact and gets this conclusion:
"But the revival, if so it may be called, has in it the marks of death.It is a spasmodic struggle before dissolution."
In this world we have seen the Roman Catholic power dying, upon thesesame terms, for many centuries. Many a time we have gotten all ready forthe funeral and found it postponed again, on account of the weather orsomething. Taught by experience, we ought not to put on our things forthis Brahminical one till we see the procession move. Apparently one ofthe most uncertain things in the world is the funeral of a religion.
I should have been glad to acquire some sort of idea of Hindoo theology,but the difficulties were too great, the matter was too intricate. Eventhe mere A, B, C of it is baffling.
There is a trinity--Brahma, Shiva, and Vishnu--independent powers,apparently, though one cannot feel quite sure of that, because in one ofthe temples there is an image where an attempt has been made toconcentrate the three in one person. The three have other names andplenty of them, and this makes confusion in one's mind. The three havewives and the wives have several names, and this increases the confusion.There are children, the children have many names, and thus the confusiongoes on and on. It is not worth while to try to get any grip upon thecloud of minor gods, there are too many of them.
It is even a justifiable economy to leave Brahma, the chiefest god ofall, out of your studies, for he seems to cut no great figure in India.The vast bulk of the national worship is lavished upon Shiva and Vishnuand their families. Shiva's symbol--the "lingam" with which Vishnu beganthe Creation--is worshiped by everybody, apparently. It is the commonestobject in Benares. It is on view everywhere, it is garlanded withflowers, offerings are made to it, it suffers no neglect. Commonly it isan upright stone, shaped like a thimble-sometimes like an elongatedthimble. This priapus-worship, then, is older than history. Mr. Parkersays that the lingams in Benares "outnumber the inhabitants."
In Benares there are many Mohammedan mosques. There are Hindoo templeswithout number--these quaintly shaped and elaborately sculptured littlestone jugs crowd all the lanes. The Ganges itself and every individualdrop of water in it are temples. Religion, then, is the business ofBenares, just as gold-production is the business of Johannesburg. Otherindustries count for nothing as compared with the vast and all-absorbingrush and drive and boom of the town's specialty. Benares is thesacredest of sacred cities. The moment you step across thesharply-defined line which separates it from the rest of the globe, youstand upon ineffably and unspeakably holy ground. Mr. Parker says: "Itis impossible to convey any adequate idea of the intense feelings ofveneration and affection with which the pious Hindoo regards 'Holy Kashi'(Benares)." And then he gives you this vivid and moving picture:
 "Let a Hindoo regiment be marched through the district, and as soon as they cross the line and enter the limits of the holy place they rend the air with cries of 'Kashi ji ki jai--jai--jai! (Holy Kashi! Hail to thee! Hail! Hail! Hail)'. The weary pilgrim scarcely able to stand, with age and weakness, blinded by the dust and heat, and almost dead with fatigue, crawls out of the oven-like railway carriage and as soon as his feet touch the ground he lifts up his withered hands and utters the same pious exclamation. Let a European in some distant city in casual talk in the bazar mention the fact that he has lived at Benares, and at once voices will be raised to call down blessings on his head, for a dweller in Benares is of all men most blessed."
It makes our own religious enthusiasm seem pale and cold. Inasmuch asthe life of religion is in the heart, not the head, Mr. Parker's touchingpicture seems to promise a sort of indefinite postponement of thatfuneral.
