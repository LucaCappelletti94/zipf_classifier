He was as shy as a newspaper is when referring to its own merits. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

Captain Wawn is crystal-clear on one point: He does not approve ofmissionaries.  They obstruct his business.  They make "Recruiting," as hecalls it ("Slave-Catching," as they call it in their frank way) a troublewhen it ought to be just a picnic and a pleasure excursion.  Themissionaries have their opinion about the manner in which the LaborTraffic is conducted, and about the recruiter's evasions of the law ofthe Traffic, and about the traffic itself--and it is distinctlyuncomplimentary to the Traffic and to everything connected with it,including the law for its regulation.  Captain Wawn's book is of veryrecent date; I have by me a pamphlet of still later date--hot from thepress, in fact--by Rev. Wm. Gray, a missionary; and the book and thepamphlet taken together make exceedingly interesting reading, to my mind.
Interesting, and easy to understand--except in one detail, which I willmention presently.  It is easy to understand why the Queensland sugarplanter should want the Kanaka recruit: he is cheap.  Very cheap, infact.  These are the figures paid by the planter: L20 to the recruiterfor getting the Kanaka or "catching" him, as the missionary phrase goes;L3 to the Queensland government for "superintending" the importation; L5deposited with the Government for the Kanaka's passage home when histhree years are up, in case he shall live that long; about L25 to theKanaka himself for three years' wages and clothing; total payment for theuse of a man three years, L53; or, including diet, L60.  Altogether, ahundred dollars a year.  One can understand why the recruiter is fond ofthe business; the recruit costs him a few cheap presents (given to therecruit's relatives, not himself), and the recruit is worth L20 to therecruiter when delivered in Queensland.  All this is clear enough; butthe thing that is not clear is, what there is about it all to persuadethe recruit.  He is young and brisk; life at home in his beautiful islandis one lazy, long holiday to him; or if he wants to work he can turn outa couple of bags of copra per week and sell it for four or five shillingsa bag.  In Queensland he must get up at dawn and work from eight totwelve hours a day in the canefields--in a much hotter climate than he isused to--and get less than four shillings a week for it.
I cannot understand his willingness to go to Queensland.  It is a deeppuzzle to me.  Here is the explanation, from the planter's point of view;at least I gather from the missionary's pamphlet that it is theplanter's:
     "When he comes from his home he is a savage, pure and simple.  He     feels no shame at his nakedness and want of adornment.  When he     returns home he does so well dressed, sporting a Waterbury watch,     collars, cuffs, boots, and jewelry.  He takes with him one or more     boxes--["Box" is English for trunk.]--well filled with clothing, a     musical instrument or two, and perfumery and other articles of     luxury he has learned to appreciate."
For just one moment we have a seeming flash of comprehension of, theKanaka's reason for exiling himself: he goes away to acquirecivilization.  Yes, he was naked and not ashamed, now he is clothed andknows how to be ashamed; he was unenlightened; now he has a Waterburywatch; he was unrefined, now he has jewelry, and something to make himsmell good; he was a nobody, a provincial, now he has been to farcountries and can show off.
It all looks plausible--for a moment.  Then the missionary takes hold ofthis explanation and pulls it to pieces, and dances on it, and damages itbeyond recognition.
     "Admitting that the foregoing description is the average one, the     average sequel is this: The cuffs and collars, if used at all, are     carried off by youngsters, who fasten them round the leg, just below     the knee, as ornaments.  The Waterbury, broken and dirty, finds its     way to the trader, who gives a trifle for it; or the inside is taken     out, the wheels strung on a thread and hung round the neck.  Knives,     axes, calico, and handkerchiefs are divided among friends, and there     is hardly one of these apiece.  The boxes, the keys often lost on     the road home, can be bought for 2s. 6d.  They are to be seen     rotting outside in almost any shore village on Tanna.  (I speak of     what I have seen.) A returned Kanaka has been furiously angry with     me because I would not buy his trousers, which he declared were just     my fit.  He sold them afterwards to one of my Aniwan teachers for     9d. worth of tobacco--a pair of trousers that probably cost him 8s.     or 10s. in Queensland.  A coat or shirt is handy for cold weather.     The white handkerchiefs, the 'senet' (perfumery), the umbrella, and     perhaps the hat, are kept.  The boots have to take their chance, if     they do not happen to fit the copra trader.  'Senet' on the hair,     streaks of paint on the face, a dirty white handkerchief round the     neck, strips of turtle shell in the ears, a belt, a sheath and     knife, and an umbrella constitute the rig of returned Kanaka at home     the day after landing."
A hat, an umbrella, a belt, a neckerchief.  Otherwise stark naked.  Allin a day the hard-earned "civilization" has melted away to this.  Andeven these perishable things must presently go.  Indeed, there is but asingle detail of his civilization that can be depended on to stay by him:according to the missionary, he has learned to swear.  This is art, andart is long, as the poet says.
In all countries the laws throw light upon the past.  The Queensland lawfor the regulation of the Labor Traffic is a confession.  It is aconfession that the evils charged by the missionaries upon the traffichad existed in the past, and that they still existed when the law wasmade.  The missionaries make a further charge: that the law is evaded bythe recruiters, and that the Government Agent sometimes helps them to doit.  Regulation 31 reveals two things: that sometimes a young fool of arecruit gets his senses back, after being persuaded to sign away hisliberty for three years, and dearly wants to get out of the engagementand stay at home with his own people; and that threats, intimidation, andforce are used to keep him on board the recruiting-ship, and to hold himto his contract.  Regulation 31 forbids these coercions.  The lawrequires that he shall be allowed to go free; and another clause of itrequires the recruiter to set him ashore--per boat, because of theprevalence of sharks.  Testimony from Rev. Mr. Gray:
     "There are 'wrinkles' for taking the penitent Kanaka.  My first     experience of the Traffic was a case of this kind in 1884.  A vessel     anchored just out of sight of our station, word was brought to me     that some boys were stolen, and the relatives wished me to go and     get them back.  The facts were, as I found, that six boys had     recruited, had rushed into the boat, the Government Agent informed     me.  They had all 'signed'; and, said the Government Agent, 'on     board they shall remain.'  I was assured that the six boys were of     age and willing to go.  Yet on getting ready to leave the ship I     found four of the lads ready to come ashore in the boat!  This I     forbade.  One of them jumped into the water and persisted in coming     ashore in my boat.  When appealed to, the Government Agent suggested     that we go and leave him to be picked up by the ship's boat, a     quarter mile distant at the time!"
The law and the missionaries feel for the repentant recruit--andproperly, one may be permitted to think, for he is only a youth andignorant and persuadable to his hurt--but sympathy for him is not kept instock by the recruiter.  Rev. Mr. Gray says:
     "A captain many years in the traffic explained to me how a penitent     could betaken.  'When a boy jumps overboard we just take a boat and     pull ahead of him, then lie between him and the shore.  If he has     not tired himself swimming, and passes the boat, keep on heading him     in this way.  The dodge rarely fails.  The boy generally tires of     swimming, gets into the boat of his own accord, and goes quietly on     board."
Yes, exhaustion is likely to make a boy quiet.  If the distressed boy hadbeen the speaker's son, and the captors savages, the speaker would havebeen surprised to see how differently the thing looked from the new pointof view; however, it is not our custom to put ourselves in the otherperson's place.  Somehow there is something pathetic about thatdisappointed young savage's resignation.  I must explain, here, that inthe traffic dialect, "boy" does not always mean boy; it means a youthabove sixteen years of age.  That is by Queensland law the age ofconsent, though it is held that recruiters allow themselves some latitudein guessing at ages.
Captain Wawn of the free spirit chafes under the annoyance of "cast-ironregulations."  They and the missionaries have poisoned his life.  Hegrieves for the good old days, vanished to come no more.  See him weep;hear him cuss between the lines!
     "For a long time we were allowed to apprehend and detain all     deserters who had signed the agreement on board ship, but the     'cast-iron' regulations of the Act of 1884 put a stop to that,     allowing the Kanaka to sign the agreement for three years' service,     travel about in the ship in receipt of the regular rations, cadge     all he could, and leave when he thought fit, so long as he did not     extend his pleasure trip to Queensland."
Rev. Mr. Gray calls this same restrictive cast-iron law a "farce." "Thereis as much cruelty and injustice done to natives by acts that are legalas by deeds unlawful.  The regulations that exist are unjust andinadequate--unjust and inadequate they must ever be."  He furnishes hisreasons for his position, but they are too long for reproduction here.
However, if the most a Kanaka advantages himself by a three-years coursein civilization in Queensland, is a necklace and an umbrella and a showyimperfection in the art of swearing, it must be that all the profit ofthe traffic goes to the white man.  This could be twisted into aplausible argument that the traffic ought to be squarely abolished.
However, there is reason for hope that that can be left alone to achieveitself.  It is claimed that the traffic will depopulate its sources ofsupply within the next twenty or thirty years.  Queensland is a veryhealthy place for white people--death-rate 12 in 1,000 of the population--but the Kanaka death-rate is away above that.  The vital statistics for1893 place it at 52; for 1894 (Mackay district), 68.  The first sixmonths of the Kanaka's exile are peculiarly perilous for him because ofthe rigors of the new climate.  The death-rate among the new men hasreached as high as 180 in the 1,000.  In the Kanaka's native home hisdeath-rate is 12 in time of peace, and 15 in time of war.  Thus exile toQueensland--with the opportunity to acquire civilization, an umbrella,and a pretty poor quality of profanity--is twelve times as deadly for himas war.  Common Christian charity, common humanity, does seem to require,not only that these people be returned to their homes, but that war,pestilence, and famine be introduced among them for their preservation.
Concerning these Pacific isles and their peoples an eloquent prophetspoke long years ago--five and fifty years ago.  In fact, he spoke alittle too early.  Prophecy is a good line of business, but it is full ofrisks.  This prophet was the Right Rev. M. Russell, LL.D., D.C.L., ofEdinburgh:
     "Is the tide of civilization to roll only to the foot of the Rocky     Mountains, and is the sun of knowledge to set at last in the waves     of the Pacific?  No; the mighty day of four thousand years is     drawing to its close; the sun of humanity has performed its destined     course; but long ere its setting rays are extinguished in the west,     its ascending beams have glittered on the isles of the eastern seas     .  .  .  .  And now we see the race of Japhet setting forth to     people the isles, and the seeds of another Europe and a second     England sown in the regions of the sun.  But mark the words of the     prophecy: 'He shall dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be     his servant.'  It is not said Canaan shall be his slave.  To the     Anglo-Saxon race is given the scepter of the globe, but there is not     given either the lash of the slave-driver or the rack of the     executioner.  The East will not be stained with the same atrocities     as the West; the frightful gangrene of an enthralled race is not to     mar the destinies of the family of Japhet in the Oriental world;     humanizing, not destroying, as they advance; uniting with, not     enslaving, the inhabitants with whom they dwell, the British race     may,"  etc., etc.
And he closes his vision with an invocation from Thomson:
          "Come, bright Improvement! on the car of Time,          And rule the spacious world from clime to clime."
Very well, Bright Improvement has arrived, you see, with hercivilization, and her Waterbury, and her umbrella, and her third-qualityprofanity, and her humanizing-not-destroying machinery, and herhundred-and-eighty death-rate, and everything is going along just ashandsome!
But the prophet that speaks last has an advantage over the pioneer in thebusiness.  Rev. Mr. Gray says:
     "What I am concerned about is that we as a Christian nation should     wipe out these races to enrich ourselves."
And he closes his pamphlet with a grim Indictment which is as eloquent inits flowerless straightforward English as is the hand-painted rhapsody ofthe early prophet:
     "My indictment of the Queensland-Kanaka Labor Traffic is this
     "1. It generally demoralizes and always impoverishes the Kanaka,     deprives him of his citizenship, and depopulates the islands fitted     to his home.
     "2. It is felt to lower the dignity of the white agricultural     laborer in Queensland, and beyond a doubt it lowers his wages there.
     "3. The whole system is fraught with danger to Australia and the     islands on the score of health.
     "4. On social and political grounds the continuance of the     Queensland Kanaka Labor Traffic must be a barrier to the true     federation of the Australian colonies.
     "5. The Regulations under which the Traffic exists in Queensland are     inadequate to prevent abuses, and in the nature of things they must     remain so.
     "6. The whole system is contrary to the spirit and doctrine of the     Gospel of Jesus Christ.  The Gospel requires us to help the weak,     but the Kanaka is fleeced and trodden down.
     "7. The bed-rock of this Traffic is that the life and liberty of a     black man are of less value than those of a white man.  And a     Traffic that has grown out of 'slave-hunting' will certainly remain     to the end not unlike its origin."
