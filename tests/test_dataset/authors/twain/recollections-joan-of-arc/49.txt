The Maid Will March No More
YES, IT was as I have said: Joan had Paris and France in her grip, andthe Hundred Years' War under her heel, and the King made her open herfist and take away her foot.
Now followed about eight months of drifting about with the King and hiscouncil, and his gay and showy and dancing and flirting and hawking andfrolicking and serenading and dissipating court--drifting from town totown and from castle to castle--a life which was pleasant to us of thepersonal staff, but not to Joan. However, she only saw it, she didn'tlive it. The King did his sincerest best to make her happy, and showed amost kind and constant anxiety in this matter.
All others had to go loaded with the chains of an exacting courtetiquette, but she was free, she was privileged. So that she paid herduty to the King once a day and passed the pleasant word, nothing furtherwas required of her. Naturally, then, she made herself a hermit, andgrieved the weary days through in her own apartments, with her thoughtsand devotions for company, and the planning of now forever unrealizablemilitary combinations for entertainment. In fancy she moved bodies of menfrom this and that and the other point, so calculating the distances tobe covered, the time required for each body, and the nature of thecountry to be traversed, as to have them appear in sight of each other ona given day or at a given hour and concentrate for battle. It was heronly game, her only relief from her burden of sorrow and inaction. Sheplayed it hour after hour, as others play chess; and lost herself in it,and so got repose for her mind and healing for her heart.
She never complained, of course. It was not her way. She was the sortthat endure in silence.
But--she was a caged eagle just the same, and pined for the free air andthe alpine heights and the fierce joys of the storm.
France was full of rovers--disbanded soldiers ready for anything thatmight turn up. Several times, at intervals, when Joan's dull captivitygrew too heavy to bear, she was allowed to gather a troop of cavalry andmake a health-restoring dash against the enemy. These things were a bathto her spirits.
It was like old times, there at Saint-Pierre-le-Moutier, to see her leadassault after assault, be driven back again and again, but always rallyand charge anew, all in a blaze of eagerness and delight; till at lastthe tempest of missiles rained so intolerably thick that old D'Aulon, whowas wounded, sounded the retreat (for the King had charged him on hishead to let no harm come to Joan); and away everybody rushed afterhim--as he supposed; but when he turned and looked, there were we of thestaff still hammering away; wherefore he rode back and urged her to come,saying she was mad to stay there with only a dozen men. Her eye dancedmerrily, and she turned upon him crying out:
"A dozen men! name of God, I have fifty-thousand, and will never budgetill this place is taken!
"Sound the charge!"
Which he did, and over the walls we went, and the fortress was ours. OldD'Aulon thought her mind was wandering; but all she meant was, that shefelt the might of fifty thousand men surging in her heart. It was afanciful expression; but, to my thinking, truer word was never said.
Then there was the affair near Lagny, where we charged the intrenchedBurgundians through the open field four times, the last timevictoriously; the best prize of it Franquet d'Arras, the free-booter andpitiless scourge of the region roundabout.
Now and then other such affairs; and at last, away toward the end of May,1430, we were in the neighborhood of Compiegne, and Joan resolved to goto the help of that place, which was being besieged by the Duke ofBurgundy.
I had been wounded lately, and was not able to ride without help; but thegood Dwarf took me on behind him, and I held on to him and was safeenough. We started at midnight, in a sullen downpour of warm rain, andwent slowly and softly and in dead silence, for we had to slip throughthe enemy's lines. We were challenged only once; we made no answer, butheld our breath and crept steadily and stealthily along, and got throughwithout any accident. About three or half past we reached Compiegne, justas the gray dawn was breaking in the east.
Joan set to work at once, and concerted a plan with Guillaume de Flavy,captain of the city--a plan for a sortie toward evening against theenemy, who was posted in three bodies on the other side of the Oise, inthe level plain. From our side one of the city gates communicated with abridge. The end of this bridge was defended on the other side of theriver by one of those fortresses called a boulevard; and this boulevardalso commanded a raised road, which stretched from its front across theplain to the village of Marguy. A force of Burgundians occupied Marguy;another was camped at Clairoix, a couple of miles above the raised road;and a body of English was holding Venette, a mile and a half below it. Akind of bow-and-arrow arrangement, you see; the causeway the arrow, theboulevard at the feather-end of it, Marguy at the barb, Venette at oneend of the bow, Clairoix at the other.
Joan's plan was to go straight per causeway against Marguy, carry it byassault, then turn swiftly upon Clairoix, up to the right, and capturethat camp in the same way, then face to the rear and be ready for heavywork, for the Duke of Burgundy lay behind Clairoix with a reserve.Flavy's lieutenant, with archers and the artillery of the boulevard, wasto keep the English troops from coming up from below and seizing thecauseway and cutting off Joan's retreat in case she should have to makeone. Also, a fleet of covered boats was to be stationed near theboulevard as an additional help in case a retreat should becomenecessary.
It was the 24th of May. At four in the afternoon Joan moved out at thehead of six hundred cavalry--on her last march in this life!
It breaks my heart. I had got myself helped up onto the walls, and fromthere I saw much that happened, the rest was told me long afterward byour two knights and other eye-witnesses. Joan crossed the bridge, andsoon left the boulevard behind her and went skimming away over the raisedroad with her horsemen clattering at her heels. She had on a brilliantsilver-gilt cape over her armor, and I could see it flap and flare andrise and fall like a little patch of white flame.
It was a bright day, and one could see far and wide over that plain. Soonwe saw the English force advancing, swiftly and in handsome order, thesunlight flashing from its arms.
Joan crashed into the Burgundians at Marguy and was repulsed. Then shesaw the other Burgundians moving down from Clairoix. Joan rallied her menand charged again, and was again rolled back. Two assaults occupy a gooddeal of time--and time was precious here. The English were approachingthe road now from Venette, but the boulevard opened fire on them and theywere checked. Joan heartened her men with inspiring words and led them tothe charge again in great style. This time she carried Marguy with ahurrah. Then she turned at once to the right and plunged into the planand struck the Clairoix force, which was just arriving; then there washeavy work, and plenty of it, the two armies hurling each other backwardturn about and about, and victory inclining first to the one, then to theother. Now all of a sudden thee was a panic on our side. Some say onething caused it, some another. Some say the cannonade made our frontranks think retreat was being cut off by the English, some say the rearranks got the idea that Joan was killed. Anyway our men broke, and wentflying in a wild rout for the causeway. Joan tried to rally them and facethem around, crying to them that victory was sure, but it did no good,they divided and swept by her like a wave. Old D'Aulon begged her toretreat while there was yet a chance for safety, but she refused; so heseized her horse's bridle and bore her along with the wreck and ruin inspite of herself. And so along the causeway they came swarming, that wildconfusion of frenzied men and horses--and the artillery had to stopfiring, of course; consequently the English and Burgundians closed in insafety, the former in front, the latter behind their prey. Clear to theboulevard the French were washed in this enveloping inundation; andthere, cornered in an angle formed by the flank of the boulevard and theslope of the causeway, they bravely fought a hopeless fight, and sankdown one by one.
Flavy, watching from the city wall, ordered the gate to be closed and thedrawbridge raised. This shut Joan out.
The little personal guard around her thinned swiftly. Both of our goodknights went down disabled; Joan's two brothers fell wounded; then NoelRainguesson--all wounded while loyally sheltering Joan from blows aimedat her. When only the Dwarf and the Paladin were left, they would notgive up, but stood their ground stoutly, a pair of steel towers streakedand splashed with blood; and where the ax of one fell, and the sword ofthe other, an enemy gasped and died.
And so fighting, and loyal to their duty to the last, good simple souls,they came to their honorable end. Peace to their memories! they were verydear to me.
Then there was a cheer and a rush, and Joan, still defiant, still layingabout her with her sword, was seized by her cape and dragged from herhorse. She was borne away a prisoner to the Duke of Burgundy's camp, andafter her followed the victorious army roaring its joy.
The awful news started instantly on its round; from lip to lip it flew;and wherever it came it struck the people as with a sort of paralysis;and they murmured over and over again, as if they were talking tothemselves, or in their sleep, "The Maid of Orleans taken! . . . Joan ofArc a prisoner! . . . the savior of France lost to us!"--and would keepsaying that over, as if they couldn't understand how it could be, or howGod could permit it, poor creatures!
You know what a city is like when it is hung from eaves to pavement withrustling black? Then you know what Rouse was like, and some other cities.But can any man tell you what the mourning in the hearts of the peasantryof France was like? No, nobody can tell you that, and, poor dumb things,they could not have told you themselves, but it was there--indeed, yes.Why, it was the spirit of a whole nation hung with crape!
The 24th of May. We will draw down the curtain now upon the most strange,and pathetic, and wonderful military drama that has been played upon thestage of the world. Joan of Arc will march no more.
