Fifty Experts Against a Novice
I GIVE you my honor now that I am not going to distort or discolor thefacts of this miserable trial. No, I will give them to you honestly,detail by detail, just as Manchon and I set them down daily in theofficial record of the court, and just as one may read them in theprinted histories.
There will be only this difference: that in talking familiarly with youshall use my right to comment upon the proceedings and explain them as Igo along, so that you can understand them better; also, I shall throw intrifles which came under our eyes and have a certain interest for you andme, but were not important enough to go into the official record. [1] Totake up my story now where I left off. We heard the clanking of Joan'schains down the corridors; she was approaching.
Presently she appeared; a thrill swept the house, and one heard deepbreaths drawn. Two guardsmen followed her at a short distance to therear. Her head was bowed a little, and she moved slowly, she being weakand her irons heavy. She had on men's attire--all black; a soft woolenstuff, intensely black, funereally black, not a speck of relieving colorin it from her throat to the floor. A wide collar of this same blackstuff lay in radiating folds upon her shoulders and breast; the sleevesof her doublet were full, down to the elbows, and tight thence to hermanacled wrists; below the doublet, tight black hose down to the chainson her ankles.
Half-way to her bench she stopped, just where a wide shaft of light fellslanting from a window, and slowly lifted her face. Another thrill!--itwas totally colorless, white as snow; a face of gleaming snow set invivid contrast upon that slender statue of somber unmitigated black. Itwas smooth and pure and girlish, beautiful beyond belief, infinitely sadand sweet. But, dear, dear! when the challenge of those untamed eyes fellupon that judge, and the droop vanished from her form and it straightenedup soldierly and noble, my heart leaped for joy; and I said, all is well,all is well--they have not broken her, they have not conquered her, sheis Joan of Arc still! Yes, it was plain to me now that there was onespirit there which this dreaded judge could not quell nor make afraid.
She moved to her place and mounted the dais and seated herself upon herbench, gathering her chains into her lap and nestling her little whitehands there. Then she waited in tranquil dignity, the only person therewho seemed unmoved and unexcited. A bronzed and brawny English soldier,standing at martial ease in the front rank of the citizen spectators, didnow most gallantly and respectfully put up his great hand and give herthe military salute; and she, smiling friendly, put up hers and returnedit; whereat there was a sympathetic little break of applause, which thejudge sternly silence.
Now the memorable inquisition called in history the Great Trial began.Fifty experts against a novice, and no one to help the novice!
The judge summarized the circumstances of the case and the public reportsand suspicions upon which it was based; then he required Joan to kneeland make oath that she would answer with exact truthfulness to allquestions asked her.
Joan's mind was not asleep. It suspected that dangerous possibilitiesmight lie hidden under this apparently fair and reasonable demand. Sheanswered with the simplicity which so often spoiled the enemy's best-laidplans in the trial at Poitiers, and said:
"No; for I do not know what you are going to ask me; you might ask of methings which I would not tell you."
This incensed the Court, and brought out a brisk flurry of angryexclamations. Joan was not disturbed. Cauchon raised his voice and beganto speak in the midst of this noise, but he was so angry that he couldhardly get his words out. He said:
"With the divine assistance of our Lord we require you to expedite theseproceedings for the welfare of your conscience. Swear, with your handsupon the Gospels, that you will answer true to the questions which shallbe asked you!" and he brought down his fat hand with a crash upon hisofficial table.
Joan said, with composure:
"As concerning my father and mother, and the faith, and what things Ihave done since my coming into France, I will gladly answer; but asregards the revelations which I have received from God, my Voices haveforbidden me to confide them to any save my King--"
Here there was another angry outburst of threats and expletives, and muchmovement and confusion; so she had to stop, and wait for the noise tosubside; then her waxen face flushed a little and she straightened up andfixed her eye on the judge, and finished her sentence in a voice that hadthe old ring to it:
--"and I will never reveal these things though you cut my head off!"
Well, maybe you know what a deliberative body of Frenchmen is like. Thejudge and half the court were on their feet in a moment, and all shakingtheir fists at the prisoner, and all storming and vituperating at once,so that you could hardly hear yourself think. They kept this up severalminutes; and because Joan sat untroubled and indifferent they grew madderand noisier all the time. Once she said, with a fleeting trace of theold-time mischief in her eye and manner:
"Prithee, speak one at a time, fair lords, then I will answer all ofyou."
At the end of three whole hours of furious debating over the oath, thesituation had not changed a jot. The Bishop was still requiring anunmodified oath, Joan was refusing for the twentieth time to take anyexcept the one which she had herself proposed. There was a physicalchange apparent, but it was confined to the court and judge; they werehoarse, droopy, exhausted by their long frenzy, and had a sort of haggardlook in their faces, poor men, whereas Joan was still placid andreposeful and did not seem noticeably tired.
The noise quieted down; there was a waiting pause of some moments'duration. Then the judge surrendered to the prisoner, and with bitternessin his voice told her to take the oath after her own fashion. Joan sunkat once to her knees; and as she laid her hands upon the Gospels, thatbig English soldier set free his mind:
"By God, if she were but English, she were not in this place another halfa second!"
It was the soldier in him responding to the soldier in her. But what astinging rebuke it was, what an arraignment of French character andFrench royalty! Would that he could have uttered just that one phrase inthe hearing of Orleans! I know that that grateful city, that adoringcity, would have risen to the last man and the last woman, and marchedupon Rouen. Some speeches--speeches that shame a man and humble him--burnthemselves into the memory and remain there. That one is burned intomine.
After Joan had made oath, Cauchon asked her her name, and where she wasborn, and some questions about her family; also what her age was. Sheanswered these. Then he asked her how much education she had.
"I have learned from my mother the Pater Noster, the Ave Maria, and theBelief. All that I know was taught me by my mother."
Questions of this unessential sort dribbled on for a considerable time.Everybody was tired out by now, except Joan. The tribunal prepared torise. At this point Cauchon forbade Joan to try to escape from prison,upon pain of being held guilty of the crime of heresy--singular logic!She answered simply:
"I am not bound by this proposition. If I could escape I would notreproach myself, for I have given no promise, and I shall not."
Then she complained of the burden of her chains, and asked that theymight be removed, for she was strongly guarded in that dungeon and therewas no need of them. But the Bishop refused, and reminded her that shehad broken out of prison twice before. Joan of Arc was too proud toinsist. She only said, as she rose to go with the guard:
"It is true, I have wanted to escape, and I do want to escape." Then sheadded, in a way that would touch the pity of anybody, I think, "It is theright of every prisoner."
And so she went from the place in the midst of an impressive stillness,which made the sharper and more distressful to me the clank of thosepathetic chains.
What presence of mind she had! One could never surprise her out of it.She saw Noel and me there when she first took her seat on the bench, andwe flushed to the forehead with excitement and emotion, but her faceshowed nothing, betrayed nothing. Her eyes sought us fifty times thatday, but they passed on and there was never any ray of recognition inthem. Another would have started upon seeing us, and then--why, thenthere could have been trouble for us, of course.
We walked slowly home together, each busy with his own grief and sayingnot a word.
