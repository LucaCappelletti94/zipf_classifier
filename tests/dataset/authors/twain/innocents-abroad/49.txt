We took another swim in the Sea of Galilee at twilight yesterday, andanother at sunrise this morning. We have not sailed, but three swims areequal to a sail, are they not? There were plenty of fish visible in thewater, but we have no outside aids in this pilgrimage but "Tent Life inthe Holy Land," "The Land and the Book," and other literature of likedescription--no fishing-tackle. There were no fish to be had in thevillage of Tiberias. True, we saw two or three vagabonds mending theirnets, but never trying to catch any thing with them.
We did not go to the ancient warm baths two miles below Tiberias. I hadno desire in the world to go there. This seemed a little strange, andprompted me to try to discover what the cause of this unreasonableindifference was. It turned out to be simply because Pliny mentionsthem. I have conceived a sort of unwarrantable unfriendliness towardPliny and St. Paul, because it seems as if I can never ferret out a placethat I can have to myself. It always and eternally transpires that St.Paul has been to that place, and Pliny has "mentioned" it.
In the early morning we mounted and started. And then a weird apparitionmarched forth at the head of the procession--a pirate, I thought, if evera pirate dwelt upon land. It was a tall Arab, as swarthy as an Indian;young-say thirty years of age. On his head he had closely bound agorgeous yellow and red striped silk scarf, whose ends, lavishly fringedwith tassels, hung down between his shoulders and dallied with the wind.From his neck to his knees, in ample folds, a robe swept down that was avery star-spangled banner of curved and sinuous bars of black and white.Out of his back, somewhere, apparently, the long stem of a chiboukprojected, and reached far above his right shoulder. Athwart his back,diagonally, and extending high above his left shoulder, was an Arab gumof Saladin's time, that was splendid with silver plating from stock clearup to the end of its measureless stretch of barrel. About his waist wasbound many and many a yard of elaborately figured but sadly tarnishedstuff that came from sumptuous Persia, and among the baggy folds in frontthe sunbeams glinted from a formidable battery of old brass-mountedhorse-pistols and the gilded hilts of blood-thirsty knives. There wereholsters for more pistols appended to the wonderful stack of long-hairedgoat-skins and Persian carpets, which the man had been taught to regardin the light of a saddle; and down among the pendulous rank of vasttassels that swung from that saddle, and clanging against the iron shovelof a stirrup that propped the warrior's knees up toward his chin, was acrooked, silver-clad scimitar of such awful dimensions and suchimplacable expression that no man might hope to look upon it and notshudder. The fringed and bedizened prince whose privilege it is to ridethe pony and lead the elephant into a country village is poor and nakedcompared to this chaos of paraphernalia, and the happy vanity of the oneis the very poverty of satisfaction compared to the majestic serenity,the overwhelming complacency of the other.
"Who is this? What is this?" That was the trembling inquiry all downthe line.
"Our guard! From Galilee to the birthplace of the Savior, the country isinfested with fierce Bedouins, whose sole happiness it is, in this life,to cut and stab and mangle and murder unoffending Christians. Allah bewith us!"
"Then hire a regiment! Would you send us out among these desperatehordes, with no salvation in our utmost need but this old turret?"
The dragoman laughed--not at the facetiousness of the simile, for verily,that guide or that courier or that dragoman never yet lived upon earthwho had in him the faintest appreciation of a joke, even though that jokewere so broad and so ponderous that if it fell on him it would flattenhim out like a postage stamp--the dragoman laughed, and then, emboldenedby some thought that was in his brain, no doubt, proceeded to extremitiesand winked.
In straits like these, when a man laughs, it is encouraging when hewinks, it is positively reassuring. He finally intimated that one guardwould be sufficient to protect us, but that that one was an absolutenecessity. It was because of the moral weight his awful panoply wouldhave with the Bedouins. Then I said we didn't want any guard at all.If one fantastic vagabond could protect eight armed Christians and a packof Arab servants from all harm, surely that detachment could protectthemselves. He shook his head doubtfully. Then I said, just think ofhow it looks--think of how it would read, to self-reliant Americans, thatwe went sneaking through this deserted wilderness under the protection ofthis masquerading Arab, who would break his neck getting out of thecountry if a man that was a man ever started after him. It was a mean,low, degrading position. Why were we ever told to bring navy revolverswith us if we had to be protected at last by this infamous star-spangledscum of the desert? These appeals were vain--the dragoman only smiledand shook his head.
I rode to the front and struck up an acquaintance with KingSolomon-in-all-his-glory, and got him to show me his lingering eternityof a gun. It had a rusty flint lock; it was ringed and barred and platedwith silver from end to end, but it was as desperately out of theperpendicular as are the billiard cues of '49 that one finds yet inservice in the ancient mining camps of California. The muzzle was eatenby the rust of centuries into a ragged filigree-work, like the end of aburnt-out stove-pipe. I shut one eye and peered within--it was flakedwith iron rust like an old steamboat boiler. I borrowed the ponderouspistols and snapped them. They were rusty inside, too--had not beenloaded for a generation. I went back, full of encouragement, andreported to the guide, and asked him to discharge this dismantledfortress. It came out, then. This fellow was a retainer of the Sheikof Tiberias. He was a source of Government revenue. He was to theEmpire of Tiberias what the customs are to America. The Sheik imposedguards upon travelers and charged them for it. It is a lucrative sourceof emolument, and sometimes brings into the national treasury as much asthirty-five or forty dollars a year.
I knew the warrior's secret now; I knew the hollow vanity of his rustytrumpery, and despised his asinine complacency. I told on him, and withreckless daring the cavalcade straight ahead into the perilous solitudesof the desert, and scorned his frantic warnings of the mutilation anddeath that hovered about them on every side.
Arrived at an elevation of twelve hundred feet above the lake, (I oughtto mention that the lake lies six hundred feet below the level of theMediterranean--no traveler ever neglects to flourish that fragment ofnews in his letters,) as bald and unthrilling a panorama as any land canafford, perhaps, was spread out before us. Yet it was so crowded withhistorical interest, that if all the pages that have been written aboutit were spread upon its surface, they would flag it from horizon tohorizon like a pavement. Among the localities comprised in this view,were Mount Hermon; the hills that border Cesarea Philippi, Dan, theSources of the Jordan and the Waters of Merom; Tiberias; the Sea ofGalilee; Joseph's Pit; Capernaum; Bethsaida; the supposed scenes of theSermon on the Mount, the feeding of the multitudes and the miraculousdraught of fishes; the declivity down which the swine ran to the sea; theentrance and the exit of the Jordan; Safed, "the city set upon a hill,"one of the four holy cities of the Jews, and the place where they believethe real Messiah will appear when he comes to redeem the world; part ofthe battle-field of Hattin, where the knightly Crusaders fought theirlast fight, and in a blaze of glory passed from the stage and ended theirsplendid career forever; Mount Tabor, the traditional scene of the Lord'sTransfiguration. And down toward the southeast lay a landscape thatsuggested to my mind a quotation (imperfectly remembered, no doubt:)
 "The Ephraimites, not being called upon to share in the rich spoils of the Ammonitish war, assembled a mighty host to fight against Jeptha, Judge of Israel; who, being apprised of their approach, gathered together the men of Israel and gave them battle and put them to flight. To make his victory the more secure, he stationed guards at the different fords and passages of the Jordan, with instructions to let none pass who could not say Shibboleth. The Ephraimites, being of a different tribe, could not frame to pronounce the word right, but called it Sibboleth, which proved them enemies and cost them their lives; wherefore, forty and two thousand fell at the different fords and passages of the Jordan that day."
We jogged along peacefully over the great caravan route from Damascus toJerusalem and Egypt, past Lubia and other Syrian hamlets, perched, in theunvarying style, upon the summit of steep mounds and hills, and fencedround about with giant cactuses, (the sign of worthless land,) withprickly pears upon them like hams, and came at last to the battle-fieldof Hattin.
It is a grand, irregular plateau, and looks as if it might have beencreated for a battle-field. Here the peerless Saladin met the Christianhost some seven hundred years ago, and broke their power in Palestine forall time to come. There had long been a truce between the opposingforces, but according to the Guide-Book, Raynauld of Chatillon, Lord ofKerak, broke it by plundering a Damascus caravan, and refusing to give upeither the merchants or their goods when Saladin demanded them. Thisconduct of an insolent petty chieftain stung the Sultan to the quick, andhe swore that he would slaughter Raynauld with his own hand, no matterhow, or when, or where he found him. Both armies prepared for war.Under the weak King of Jerusalem was the very flower of the Christianchivalry. He foolishly compelled them to undergo a long, exhaustingmarch, in the scorching sun, and then, without water or otherrefreshment, ordered them to encamp in this open plain. The splendidlymounted masses of Moslem soldiers swept round the north end ofGenessaret, burning and destroying as they came, and pitched their campin front of the opposing lines. At dawn the terrific fight began.Surrounded on all sides by the Sultan's swarming battalions, theChristian Knights fought on without a hope for their lives. They foughtwith desperate valor, but to no purpose; the odds of heat and numbers,and consuming thirst, were too great against them. Towards the middle ofthe day the bravest of their band cut their way through the Moslem ranksand gained the summit of a little hill, and there, hour after hour, theyclosed around the banner of the Cross, and beat back the chargingsquadrons of the enemy.
But the doom of the Christian power was sealed. Sunset found SaladinLord of Palestine, the Christian chivalry strewn in heaps upon the field,and the King of Jerusalem, the Grand Master of the Templars, and Raynauldof Chatillon, captives in the Sultan's tent. Saladin treated two of theprisoners with princely courtesy, and ordered refreshments to be setbefore them. When the King handed an iced Sherbet to Chatillon, theSultan said, "It is thou that givest it to him, not I." He rememberedhis oath, and slaughtered the hapless Knight of Chatillon with his ownhand.
It was hard to realize that this silent plain had once resounded withmartial music and trembled to the tramp of armed men. It was hard topeople this solitude with rushing columns of cavalry, and stir its torpidpulses with the shouts of victors, the shrieks of the wounded, and theflash of banner and steel above the surging billows of war. A desolationis here that not even imagination can grace with the pomp of life andaction.
We reached Tabor safely, and considerably in advance of that oldiron-clad swindle of a guard. We never saw a human being on the wholeroute, much less lawless hordes of Bedouins. Tabor stands solitary andalone, a giant sentinel above the Plain of Esdraelon. It rises somefourteen hundred feet above the surrounding level, a green, wooden cone,symmetrical and full of grace--a prominent landmark, and one that isexceedingly pleasant to eyes surfeited with the repulsive monotony ofdesert Syria. We climbed the steep path to its summit, through breezyglades of thorn and oak. The view presented from its highest peak wasalmost beautiful. Below, was the broad, level plain of Esdraelon,checkered with fields like a chess-board, and full as smooth and level,seemingly; dotted about its borders with white, compact villages, andfaintly penciled, far and near, with the curving lines of roads andtrails. When it is robed in the fresh verdure of spring, it must form acharming picture, even by itself. Skirting its southern border rises"Little Hermon," over whose summit a glimpse of Gilboa is caught. Nain,famous for the raising of the widow's son, and Endor, as famous for theperformances of her witch are in view. To the eastward lies the Valleyof the Jordan and beyond it the mountains of Gilead. Westward is MountCarmel. Hermon in the north--the table-lands of Bashan--Safed, the holycity, gleaming white upon a tall spur of the mountains of Lebanon--a steel-blue corner of the Sea of Galilee--saddle-peaked Hattin,traditional "Mount of Beatitudes" and mute witness brave fights of theCrusading host for Holy Cross--these fill up the picture.
To glance at the salient features of this landscape through thepicturesque framework of a ragged and ruined stone window--arch of thetime of Christ, thus hiding from sight all that is unattractive, is tosecure to yourself a pleasure worth climbing the mountain to enjoy. Onemust stand on his head to get the best effect in a fine sunset, and set alandscape in a bold, strong framework that is very close at hand, tobring out all its beauty. One learns this latter truth never more toforget it, in that mimic land of enchantment, the wonderful garden of mylord the Count Pallavicini, near Genoa. You go wandering for hours amonghills and wooded glens, artfully contrived to leave the impression thatNature shaped them and not man; following winding paths and comingsuddenly upon leaping cascades and rustic bridges; finding sylvan lakeswhere you expected them not; loitering through battered mediaeval castlesin miniature that seem hoary with age and yet were built a dozen yearsago; meditating over ancient crumbling tombs, whose marble columns weremarred and broken purposely by the modern artist that made them;stumbling unawares upon toy palaces, wrought of rare and costlymaterials, and again upon a peasant's hut, whose dilapidated furniturewould never suggest that it was made so to order; sweeping round andround in the midst of a forest on an enchanted wooden horse that is movedby some invisible agency; traversing Roman roads and passing undermajestic triumphal arches; resting in quaint bowers where unseen spiritsdischarge jets of water on you from every possible direction, and whereeven the flowers you touch assail you with a shower; boating on asubterranean lake among caverns and arches royally draped with clusteringstalactites, and passing out into open day upon another lake, which isbordered with sloping banks of grass and gay with patrician barges thatswim at anchor in the shadow of a miniature marble temple that rises outof the clear water and glasses its white statues, its rich capitals andfluted columns in the tranquil depths. So, from marvel to marvel youhave drifted on, thinking all the time that the one last seen must be thechiefest. And, verily, the chiefest wonder is reserved until the last,but you do not see it until you step ashore, and passing through awilderness of rare flowers, collected from every corner of the earth, youstand at the door of one more mimic temple. Right in this place theartist taxed his genius to the utmost, and fairly opened the gates offairy land. You look through an unpretending pane of glass, stainedyellow--the first thing you see is a mass of quivering foliage, ten shortsteps before you, in the midst of which is a ragged opening like agateway-a thing that is common enough in nature, and not apt to excitesuspicions of a deep human design--and above the bottom of the gateway,project, in the most careless way! a few broad tropic leaves andbrilliant flowers. All of a sudden, through this bright, bold gateway,you catch a glimpse of the faintest, softest, richest picture that evergraced the dream of a dying Saint, since John saw the New Jerusalemglimmering above the clouds of Heaven. A broad sweep of sea, fleckedwith careening sails; a sharp, jutting cape, and a lofty lighthouse onit; a sloping lawn behind it; beyond, a portion of the old "city ofpalaces," with its parks and hills and stately mansions; beyond these, aprodigious mountain, with its strong outlines sharply cut against oceanand sky; and over all, vagrant shreds and flakes of cloud, floating in asea of gold. The ocean is gold, the city is gold, the meadow, themountain, the sky--every thing is golden-rich, and mellow, and dreamy asa vision of Paradise. No artist could put upon canvas, its entrancingbeauty, and yet, without the yellow glass, and the carefully contrivedaccident of a framework that cast it into enchanted distance and shut outfrom it all unattractive features, it was not a picture to fall intoecstasies over. Such is life, and the trail of the serpent is over usall.
There is nothing for it now but to come back to old Tabor, though thesubject is tiresome enough, and I can not stick to it for wandering offto scenes that are pleasanter to remember. I think I will skip, any how.There is nothing about Tabor (except we concede that it was the scene ofthe Transfiguration,) but some gray old ruins, stacked up there in allages of the world from the days of stout Gideon and parties thatflourished thirty centuries ago to the fresh yesterday of Crusadingtimes. It has its Greek Convent, and the coffee there is good, but nevera splinter of the true cross or bone of a hallowed saint to arrest theidle thoughts of worldlings and turn them into graver channels.A Catholic church is nothing to me that has no relics.
The plain of Esdraelon--"the battle-field of the nations"--only sets oneto dreaming of Joshua, and Benhadad, and Saul, and Gideon; Tamerlane,Tancred, Coeur de Lion, and Saladin; the warrior Kings of Persia, Egypt'sheroes, and Napoleon--for they all fought here. If the magic of themoonlight could summon from the graves of forgotten centuries and manylands the countless myriads that have battled on this wide, far-reachingfloor, and array them in the thousand strange Costumes of their hundrednationalities, and send the vast host sweeping down the plain, splendidwith plumes and banners and glittering lances, I could stay here an ageto see the phantom pageant. But the magic of the moonlight is a vanityand a fraud; and whoso putteth his trust in it shall suffer sorrow anddisappointment.
Down at the foot of Tabor, and just at the edge of the storied Plain ofEsdraelon, is the insignificant village of Deburieh, where Deborah,prophetess of Israel, lived. It is just like Magdala.
