"Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!Tired of our company, hey?"
I says:
"No, your majesty, we warn't -- PLEASE don't, yourmajesty!"
"Quick, then, and tell us what WAS your idea, orI'll shake the insides out o' you!"
"Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it hap-pened, your majesty. The man that had a-holt of mewas very good to me, and kept saying he had a boyabout as big as me that died last year, and he wassorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and whenthey was all took by surprise by finding the gold, andmade a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and whis-pers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and Ilit out. It didn't seem no good for ME to stay -- Icouldn't do nothing, and I didn't want to be hung ifI could get away. So I never stopped running till Ifound the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim tohurry, or they'd catch me and hang me yet, and said Iwas afeard you and the duke wasn't alive now, andI was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful gladwhen we see you coming; you may ask Jim if Ididn't."
Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shutup, and said, "Oh, yes, it's MIGHTY likely!" andshook me up again, and said he reckoned he'd drowndme. But the duke says:
"Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would YOU a doneany different? Did you inquire around for HIM whenyou got loose? I don't remember it."
So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss thattown and everybody in it. But the duke says:
"You better a blame' sight give YOURSELF a goodcussing, for you're the one that's entitled to it most.You hain't done a thing from the start that had anysense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky withthat imaginary blue-arrow mark. That WAS bright --it was right down bully; and it was the thing thatsaved us. For if it hadn't been for that they'd a jailedus till them Englishmen's baggage come -- and then --the penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em tothe graveyard, and the gold done us a still biggerkindness; for if the excited fools hadn't let go allholts and made that rush to get a look we'd a slept inour cravats to-night -- cravats warranted to WEAR, too-- longer than WE'D need 'em."
They was still a minute -- thinking; then the kingsays, kind of absent-minded like:
"Mf! And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it!"
That made me squirm!
"Yes," says the duke, kinder slow and deliberateand sarcastic, "WE did."
After about a half a minute the king drawls out:
"Leastways, I did."
The duke says, the same way:
"On the contrary, I did."
The king kind of ruffles up, and says:
"Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?"
The duke says, pretty brisk:
"When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask,what was YOU referring to?"
"Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but Idon't know -- maybe you was asleep, and didn't knowwhat you was about."
The duke bristles up now, and says:
"Oh, let UP on this cussed nonsense; do you takeme for a blame' fool? Don't you reckon I know whohid that money in that coffin?"
"YES, sir! I know you DO know, because you doneit yourself!"
"It's a lie!" -- and the duke went for him. Theking sings out:
"Take y'r hands off! -- leggo my throat! -- I take itall back!"
The duke says:
"Well, you just own up, first, that you DID hidethat money there, intending to give me the slip one ofthese days, and come back and dig it up, and have itall to yourself."
"Wait jest a minute, duke -- answer me this onequestion, honest and fair; if you didn't put the moneythere, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and take back every-thing I said."
"You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know Ididn't. There, now!"
"Well, then, I b'lieve you. But answer me onlyjest this one more -- now DON'T git mad; didn't youhave it in your mind to hook the money and hide it?"
The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then hesays:
"Well, I don't care if I DID, I didn't DO it, anyway.But you not only had it in mind to do it, but youDONE it."
"I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that'shonest. I won't say I warn't goin' to do it, because IWAS; but you -- I mean somebody -- got in ahead o'me."
"It's a lie! You done it, and you got to SAY youdone it, or --"
The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
"'Nough! -- I OWN UP!"
I was very glad to hear him say that; it made mefeel much more easier than what I was feeling before.So the duke took his hands off and says:
"If you ever deny it again I'll drown you. It'sWELL for you to set there and blubber like a baby -- it'sfitten for you, after the way you've acted. I neversee such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble every-thing -- and I a-trusting you all the time, like you wasmy own father. You ought to been ashamed of your-self to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poorniggers, and you never say a word for 'em. It makesme feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVEthat rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now why you wasso anxious to make up the deffisit -- you wanted toget what money I'd got out of the Nonesuch and onething or another, and scoop it ALL!"
The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
"Why, duke, it was you that said make up thedeffisit; it warn't me."
"Dry up! I don't want to hear no more out ofyou!" says the duke. "And NOW you see what youGOT by it. They've got all their own money back, andall of OURN but a shekel or two BESIDES. G'long to bed,and don't you deffersit ME no more deffersits, long 'sYOU live!"
So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took tohis bottle for comfort, and before long the duke tackledHIS bottle; and so in about a half an hour they was asthick as thieves again, and the tighter they got thelovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in eachother's arms. They both got powerful mellow, but Inoticed the king didn't get mellow enough to forget toremember to not deny about hiding the money-bagagain. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Ofcourse when they got to snoring we had a long gabble,and I told Jim everything.
