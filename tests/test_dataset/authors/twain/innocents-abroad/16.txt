VERSAILLES! It is wonderfully beautiful! You gaze and stare and try tounderstand that it is real, that it is on the earth, that it is not theGarden of Eden--but your brain grows giddy, stupefied by the world ofbeauty around you, and you half believe you are the dupe of an exquisitedream. The scene thrills one like military music! A noble palace,stretching its ornamented front, block upon block away, till it seemedthat it would never end; a grand promenade before it, whereon the armiesof an empire might parade; all about it rainbows of flowers, and colossalstatues that were almost numberless and yet seemed only scattered overthe ample space; broad flights of stone steps leading down from thepromenade to lower grounds of the park--stairways that whole regimentsmight stand to arms upon and have room to spare; vast fountains whosegreat bronze effigies discharged rivers of sparkling water into the airand mingled a hundred curving jets together in forms of matchless beauty;wide grass-carpeted avenues that branched hither and thither in everydirection and wandered to seemingly interminable distances, walled allthe way on either side with compact ranks of leafy trees whose branchesmet above and formed arches as faultless and as symmetrical as ever werecarved in stone; and here and there were glimpses of sylvan lakes withminiature ships glassed in their surfaces. And every where--on thepalace steps, and the great promenade, around the fountains, among thetrees, and far under the arches of the endless avenues--hundreds andhundreds of people in gay costumes walked or ran or danced, and gave tothe fairy picture the life and animation which was all of perfection itcould have lacked.
It was worth a pilgrimage to see. Everything is on so gigantic a scale.Nothing is small--nothing is cheap. The statues are all large; thepalace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county; the avenues areinterminable. All the distances and all the dimensions about Versaillesare vast. I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances andthese dimensions beyond all reason, and that they made Versailles morebeautiful than it was possible for any place in the world to be. I knownow that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect, andthat no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as itis in reality. I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundredmillions of dollars in creating this marvelous park, when bread was soscarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now. He took atract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make thispark and build this palace and a road to it from Paris. He kept 36,000men employed daily on it, and the labor was so unhealthy that they usedto die and be hauled off by cartloads every night. The wife of anobleman of the time speaks of this as an "inconvenience," but naivelyremarks that "it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state oftranquillity we now enjoy."
I always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery intopyramids and squares and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes, andwhen I saw the same thing being practiced in this great park I began tofeel dissatisfied. But I soon saw the idea of the thing and the wisdomof it. They seek the general effect. We distort a dozen sickly treesinto unaccustomed shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining room,and then surely they look absurd enough. But here they take two hundredthousand tall forest trees and set them in a double row; allow no sign ofleaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet above theground; from that point the boughs begin to project, and very graduallythey extend outward further and further till they meet overhead, and afaultless tunnel of foliage is formed. The arch is mathematicallyprecise. The effect is then very fine. They make trees take fiftydifferent shapes, and so these quaint effects are infinitely varied andpicturesque. The trees in no two avenues are shaped alike, andconsequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the nature ofmonotonous uniformity. I will drop this subject now, leaving it toothers to determine how these people manage to make endless ranks oflofty forest trees grow to just a certain thickness of trunk (say a footand two-thirds); how they make them spring to precisely the same heightfor miles; how they make them grow so close together; how they compel onehuge limb to spring from the same identical spot on each tree and formthe main sweep of the arch; and how all these things are kept exactly inthe same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness and symmetrymonth after month and year after year--for I have tried to reason out theproblem and have failed.
We walked through the great hall of sculpture and the one hundred andfifty galleries of paintings in the palace of Versailles, and felt thatto be in such a place was useless unless one had a whole year at hisdisposal. These pictures are all battle scenes, and only one solitarylittle canvas among them all treats of anything but great Frenchvictories. We wandered, also, through the Grand Trianon and the PetitTrianon, those monuments of royal prodigality, and with histories somournful--filled, as it is, with souvenirs of Napoleon the First, andthree dead kings and as many queens. In one sumptuous bed they had allslept in succession, but no one occupies it now. In a large dining roomstood the table at which Louis XIV and his mistress Madame Maintenon, andafter them Louis XV, and Pompadour, had sat at their meals naked andunattended--for the table stood upon a trapdoor, which descended with itto regions below when it was necessary to replenish its dishes. In aroom of the Petit Trianon stood the furniture, just as poor MarieAntoinette left it when the mob came and dragged her and the King toParis, never to return. Near at hand, in the stables, were prodigiouscarriages that showed no color but gold--carriages used by former kingsof France on state occasions, and never used now save when a kingly headis to be crowned or an imperial infant christened. And with them weresome curious sleighs, whose bodies were shaped like lions, swans, tigers,etc.--vehicles that had once been handsome with pictured designs andfine workmanship, but were dusty and decaying now. They had theirhistory. When Louis XIV had finished the Grand Trianon, he toldMaintenon he had created a Paradise for her, and asked if she could thinkof anything now to wish for. He said he wished the Trianon to beperfection--nothing less. She said she could think of but one thing--itwas summer, and it was balmy France--yet she would like well to sleighride in the leafy avenues of Versailles! The next morning found milesand miles of grassy avenues spread thick with snowy salt and sugar, and aprocession of those quaint sleighs waiting to receive the chief concubineof the gaiest and most unprincipled court that France has ever seen!
From sumptuous Versailles, with its palaces, its statues, its gardens,and its fountains, we journeyed back to Paris and sought its antipodes--the Faubourg St. Antoine. Little, narrow streets; dirty childrenblockading them; greasy, slovenly women capturing and spanking them;filthy dens on first floors, with rag stores in them (the heaviestbusiness in the Faubourg is the chiffonier's); other filthy dens wherewhole suits of second and third-hand clothing are sold at prices thatwould ruin any proprietor who did not steal his stock; still other filthydens where they sold groceries--sold them by the half-pennyworth--fivedollars would buy the man out, goodwill and all. Up these little crookedstreets they will murder a man for seven dollars and dump the body in theSeine. And up some other of these streets--most of them, I should say--live lorettes.
All through this Faubourg St. Antoine, misery, poverty, vice, and crimego hand in hand, and the evidences of it stare one in the face from everyside. Here the people live who begin the revolutions. Whenever there isanything of that kind to be done, they are always ready. They take asmuch genuine pleasure in building a barricade as they do in cutting athroat or shoving a friend into the Seine. It is these savage-lookingruffians who storm the splendid halls of the Tuileries occasionally, andswarm into Versailles when a king is to be called to account.
But they will build no more barricades, they will break no more soldiers'heads with paving-stones. Louis Napoleon has taken care of all that. Heis annihilating the crooked streets and building in their stead nobleboulevards as straight as an arrow--avenues which a cannon ball couldtraverse from end to end without meeting an obstruction more irresistiblethan the flesh and bones of men--boulevards whose stately edifices willnever afford refuges and plotting places for starving, discontentedrevolution breeders. Five of these great thoroughfares radiate from oneample centre--a centre which is exceedingly well adapted to theaccommodation of heavy artillery. The mobs used to riot there, but theymust seek another rallying-place in future. And this ingenious Napoleonpaves the streets of his great cities with a smooth, compact compositionof asphaltum and sand. No more barricades of flagstones--no moreassaulting his Majesty's troops with cobbles. I cannot feel friendlytoward my quondam fellow-American, Napoleon III., especially at thistime,--[July, 1867.]--when in fancy I see his credulous victim,Maximilian, lying stark and stiff in Mexico, and his maniac widowwatching eagerly from her French asylum for the form that will nevercome--but I do admire his nerve, his calm self-reliance, his shrewd goodsense.
