See, I have climbed the mountain sideUp to this holy house of God,Where once that Angel-Painter trodWho saw the heavens opened wide,
And throned upon the crescent moonThe Virginal white Queen of Grace,--Mary! could I but see thy faceDeath could not come at all too soon.
O crowned by God with thorns and pain!Mother of Christ! O mystic wife!My heart is weary of this lifeAnd over-sad to sing again.
O crowned by God with love and flame!O crowned by Christ the Holy One!O listen ere the searching sunShow to the world my sin and shame.
