There are a good many things about this Italy which I do not understand--and more especially I can not understand how a bankrupt Government canhave such palatial railroad depots and such marvels of turnpikes. Why,these latter are as hard as adamant, as straight as a line, as smooth asa floor, and as white as snow. When it is too dark to see any otherobject, one can still see the white turnpikes of France and Italy; andthey are clean enough to eat from, without a table-cloth. And yet notolls are charged.
As for the railways--we have none like them. The cars slide as smoothlyalong as if they were on runners. The depots are vast palaces of cutmarble, with stately colonnades of the same royal stone traversing themfrom end to end, and with ample walls and ceilings richly decorated withfrescoes. The lofty gateways are graced with statues, and the broadfloors are all laid in polished flags of marble.
These things win me more than Italy's hundred galleries of priceless arttreasures, because I can understand the one and am not competent toappreciate the other. In the turnpikes, the railways, the depots, andthe new boulevards of uniform houses in Florence and other cities here, Isee the genius of Louis Napoleon, or rather, I see the works of thatstatesman imitated. But Louis has taken care that in France there shallbe a foundation for these improvements--money. He has always thewherewithal to back up his projects; they strengthen France and neverweaken her. Her material prosperity is genuine. But here the case isdifferent. This country is bankrupt. There is no real foundation forthese great works. The prosperity they would seem to indicate is apretence. There is no money in the treasury, and so they enfeeble herinstead of strengthening. Italy has achieved the dearest wish of herheart and become an independent State--and in so doing she has drawn anelephant in the political lottery. She has nothing to feed it on.Inexperienced in government, she plunged into all manner of uselessexpenditure, and swamped her treasury almost in a day. She squanderedmillions of francs on a navy which she did not need, and the first timeshe took her new toy into action she got it knocked higher thanGilderoy's kite--to use the language of the Pilgrims.
But it is an ill-wind that blows nobody good. A year ago, when Italy sawutter ruin staring her in the face and her greenbacks hardly worth thepaper they were printed on, her Parliament ventured upon a 'coup de main'that would have appalled the stoutest of her statesmen under lessdesperate circumstances. They, in a manner, confiscated the domains ofthe Church! This in priest-ridden Italy! This in a land which hasgroped in the midnight of priestly superstition for sixteen hundredyears! It was a rare good fortune for Italy, the stress of weather thatdrove her to break from this prison-house.
They do not call it confiscating the church property. That would soundtoo harshly yet. But it amounts to that. There are thousands ofchurches in Italy, each with untold millions of treasures stored away inits closets, and each with its battalion of priests to be supported.And then there are the estates of the Church--league on league of therichest lands and the noblest forests in all Italy--all yielding immenserevenues to the Church, and none paying a cent in taxes to the State.In some great districts the Church owns all the property--lands,watercourses, woods, mills and factories. They buy, they sell, theymanufacture, and since they pay no taxes, who can hope to compete withthem?
Well, the Government has seized all this in effect, and will yet seize itin rigid and unpoetical reality, no doubt. Something must be done tofeed a starving treasury, and there is no other resource in all Italy--none but the riches of the Church. So the Government intends to take toitself a great portion of the revenues arising from priestly farms,factories, etc., and also intends to take possession of the churches andcarry them on, after its own fashion and upon its own responsibility.In a few instances it will leave the establishments of great pet churchesundisturbed, but in all others only a handful of priests will be retainedto preach and pray, a few will be pensioned, and the balance turnedadrift.
Pray glance at some of these churches and their embellishments, and seewhether the Government is doing a righteous thing or not. In Venice,today, a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants, there are twelve hundredpriests. Heaven only knows how many there were before the Parliamentreduced their numbers. There was the great Jesuit Church. Under the oldregime it required sixty priests to engineer it--the Government does itwith five, now, and the others are discharged from service. All aboutthat church wretchedness and poverty abound. At its door a dozen hatsand bonnets were doffed to us, as many heads were humbly bowed, and asmany hands extended, appealing for pennies--appealing with foreign wordswe could not understand, but appealing mutely, with sad eyes, and sunkencheeks, and ragged raiment, that no words were needed to translate. Thenwe passed within the great doors, and it seemed that the riches of theworld were before us! Huge columns carved out of single masses ofmarble, and inlaid from top to bottom with a hundred intricate figureswrought in costly verde antique; pulpits of the same rich materials,whose draperies hung down in many a pictured fold, the stony fabriccounterfeiting the delicate work of the loom; the grand altar brilliantwith polished facings and balustrades of oriental agate, jasper, verdeantique, and other precious stones, whose names, even, we seldom hear--and slabs of priceless lapis lazuli lavished every where as recklessly asif the church had owned a quarry of it. In the midst of all thismagnificence, the solid gold and silver furniture of the altar seemedcheap and trivial. Even the floors and ceilings cost a princely fortune.
Now, where is the use of allowing all those riches to lie idle, whilehalf of that community hardly know, from day to day, how they are goingto keep body and soul together? And, where is the wisdom in permittinghundreds upon hundreds of millions of francs to be locked up in theuseless trumpery of churches all over Italy, and the people ground todeath with taxation to uphold a perishing Government?
As far as I can see, Italy, for fifteen hundred years, has turned all herenergies, all her finances, and all her industry to the building up of avast array of wonderful church edifices, and starving half her citizensto accomplish it. She is to-day one vast museum of magnificence andmisery. All the churches in an ordinary American city put together couldhardly buy the jeweled frippery in one of her hundred cathedrals. Andfor every beggar in America, Italy can show a hundred--and rags andvermin to match. It is the wretchedest, princeliest land on earth.
Look at the grand Duomo of Florence--a vast pile that has been sappingthe purses of her citizens for five hundred years, and is not nearlyfinished yet. Like all other men, I fell down and worshipped it, butwhen the filthy beggars swarmed around me the contrast was too striking,too suggestive, and I said, "O, sons of classic Italy, is the spirit ofenterprise, of self-reliance, of noble endeavor, utterly dead within ye?Curse your indolent worthlessness, why don't you rob your church?"
Three hundred happy, comfortable priests are employed in that Cathedral.
And now that my temper is up, I may as well go on and abuse every body Ican think of. They have a grand mausoleum in Florence, which they builtto bury our Lord and Saviour and the Medici family in. It soundsblasphemous, but it is true, and here they act blasphemy. The dead anddamned Medicis who cruelly tyrannized over Florence and were her cursefor over two hundred years, are salted away in a circle of costly vaults,and in their midst the Holy Sepulchre was to have been set up. Theexpedition sent to Jerusalem to seize it got into trouble and could notaccomplish the burglary, and so the centre of the mausoleum is vacantnow. They say the entire mausoleum was intended for the Holy Sepulchre,and was only turned into a family burying place after the Jerusalemexpedition failed--but you will excuse me. Some of those Medicis wouldhave smuggled themselves in sure.--What they had not the effrontery todo, was not worth doing. Why, they had their trivial, forgotten exploitson land and sea pictured out in grand frescoes (as did also the ancientDoges of Venice) with the Saviour and the Virgin throwing bouquets tothem out of the clouds, and the Deity himself applauding from his thronein Heaven! And who painted these things? Why, Titian, Tintoretto, PaulVeronese, Raphael--none other than the world's idols, the "old masters."
Andrea del Sarto glorified his princes in pictures that must save themfor ever from the oblivion they merited, and they let him starve. Servedhim right. Raphael pictured such infernal villains as Catherine andMarie de Medicis seated in heaven and conversing familiarly with theVirgin Mary and the angels, (to say nothing of higher personages,) andyet my friends abuse me because I am a little prejudiced against the oldmasters--because I fail sometimes to see the beauty that is in theirproductions. I can not help but see it, now and then, but I keep onprotesting against the groveling spirit that could persuade those mastersto prostitute their noble talents to the adulation of such monsters asthe French, Venetian and Florentine Princes of two and three hundredyears ago, all the same.
I am told that the old masters had to do these shameful things for bread,the princes and potentates being the only patrons of art. If a grandlygifted man may drag his pride and his manhood in the dirt for breadrather than starve with the nobility that is in him untainted, the excuseis a valid one. It would excuse theft in Washingtons and Wellingtons,and unchastity in women as well.
But somehow, I can not keep that Medici mausoleum out of my memory. Itis as large as a church; its pavement is rich enough for the pavement ofa King's palace; its great dome is gorgeous with frescoes; its walls aremade of--what? Marble?--plaster?--wood?--paper? No. Red porphyry--verde antique--jasper--oriental agate--alabaster--mother-of-pearl--chalcedony--red coral--lapis lazuli! All the vast walls are made whollyof these precious stones, worked in, and in and in together in elaboratepattern s and figures, and polished till they glow like great mirrorswith the pictured splendors reflected from the dome overhead. And beforea statue of one of those dead Medicis reposes a crown that blazes withdiamonds and emeralds enough to buy a ship-of-the-line, almost. Theseare the things the Government has its evil eye upon, and a happy thing itwill be for Italy when they melt away in the public treasury.
And now----. However, another beggar approaches. I will go out anddestroy him, and then come back and write another chapter ofvituperation.
Having eaten the friendless orphan--having driven away his comrades--having grown calm and reflective at length--I now feel in a kindliermood. I feel that after talking so freely about the priests and thechurches, justice demands that if I know any thing good about either Iought to say it. I have heard of many things that redound to the creditof the priesthood, but the most notable matter that occurs to me now isthe devotion one of the mendicant orders showed during the prevalence ofthe cholera last year. I speak of the Dominican friars--men who wear acoarse, heavy brown robe and a cowl, in this hot climate, and gobarefoot. They live on alms altogether, I believe. They mustunquestionably love their religion, to suffer so much for it. When thecholera was raging in Naples; when the people were dying by hundreds andhundreds every day; when every concern for the public welfare wasswallowed up in selfish private interest, and every citizen made thetaking care of himself his sole object, these men banded themselvestogether and went about nursing the sick and burying the dead. Theirnoble efforts cost many of them their lives. They laid them downcheerfully, and well they might. Creeds mathematically precise, andhair-splitting niceties of doctrine, are absolutely necessary for thesalvation of some kinds of souls, but surely the charity, the purity, theunselfishness that are in the hearts of men like these would save theirsouls though they were bankrupt in the true religion--which is ours.
One of these fat bare-footed rascals came here to Civita Vecchia with usin the little French steamer. There were only half a dozen of us in thecabin. He belonged in the steerage. He was the life of the ship, thebloody-minded son of the Inquisition! He and the leader of the marineband of a French man-of-war played on the piano and sang opera turnabout; they sang duets together; they rigged impromptu theatricalcostumes and gave us extravagant farces and pantomimes. We got alongfirst-rate with the friar, and were excessively conversational, albeit hecould not understand what we said, and certainly he never uttered a wordthat we could guess the meaning of.
This Civita Vecchia is the finest nest of dirt, vermin and ignorance wehave found yet, except that African perdition they call Tangier, which isjust like it. The people here live in alleys two yards wide, which havea smell about them which is peculiar but not entertaining. It is wellthe alleys are not wider, because they hold as much smell now as a personcan stand, and of course, if they were wider they would hold more, andthen the people would die. These alleys are paved with stone, andcarpeted with deceased cats, and decayed rags, and decomposedvegetable-tops, and remnants of old boots, all soaked with dish-water,and the people sit around on stools and enjoy it. They are indolent, asa general thing, and yet have few pastimes. They work two or threehours at a time, but not hard, and then they knock off and catch flies.This does not require any talent, because they only have to grab--ifthey do not get the one they are after, they get another. It is all thesame to them. They have no partialities. Whichever one they get is theone they want.
They have other kinds of insects, but it does not make them arrogant.They are very quiet, unpretending people. They have more of these kindof things than other communities, but they do not boast.
They are very uncleanly--these people--in face, in person and dress.When they see any body with a clean shirt on, it arouses their scorn.The women wash clothes, half the day, at the public tanks in the streets,but they are probably somebody else's. Or may be they keep one set towear and another to wash; because they never put on any that have everbeen washed. When they get done washing, they sit in the alleys andnurse their cubs. They nurse one ash-cat at a time, and the othersscratch their backs against the door-post and are happy.
All this country belongs to the Papal States. They do not appear to haveany schools here, and only one billiard table. Their education is at avery low stage. One portion of the men go into the military, anotherinto the priesthood, and the rest into the shoe-making business.
They keep up the passport system here, but so they do in Turkey. Thisshows that the Papal States are as far advanced as Turkey. This factwill be alone sufficient to silence the tongues of malignantcalumniators. I had to get my passport vised for Rome in Florence, andthen they would not let me come ashore here until a policeman hadexamined it on the wharf and sent me a permit. They did not even dare tolet me take my passport in my hands for twelve hours, I looked soformidable. They judged it best to let me cool down. They thought Iwanted to take the town, likely. Little did they know me. I wouldn'thave it. They examined my baggage at the depot. They took one of myablest jokes and read it over carefully twice and then read it backwards.But it was too deep for them. They passed it around, and every bodyspeculated on it awhile, but it mastered them all.
It was no common joke. At length a veteran officer spelled it overdeliberately and shook his head three or four times and said that in hisopinion it was seditious. That was the first time I felt alarmed. Iimmediately said I would explain the document, and they crowded around.And so I explained and explained and explained, and they took notes ofall I said, but the more I explained the more they could not understandit, and when they desisted at last, I could not even understand itmyself. They said they believed it was an incendiary document, leveledat the government. I declared solemnly that it was not, but they onlyshook their heads and would not be satisfied. Then they consulted a goodwhile; and finally they confiscated it. I was very sorry for this,because I had worked a long time on that joke, and took a good deal ofpride in it, and now I suppose I shall never see it any more. I supposeit will be sent up and filed away among the criminal archives of Rome,and will always be regarded as a mysterious infernal machine which wouldhave blown up like a mine and scattered the good Pope all around, but fora miraculous providential interference. And I suppose that all the timeI am in Rome the police will dog me about from place to place becausethey think I am a dangerous character.
It is fearfully hot in Civita Vecchia. The streets are made very narrowand the houses built very solid and heavy and high, as a protectionagainst the heat. This is the first Italian town I have seen which doesnot appear to have a patron saint. I suppose no saint but the one thatwent up in the chariot of fire could stand the climate.
There is nothing here to see. They have not even a cathedral, witheleven tons of solid silver archbishops in the back room; and they do notshow you any moldy buildings that are seven thousand years old; nor anysmoke-dried old fire-screens which are chef d'oeuvres of Reubens orSimpson, or Titian or Ferguson, or any of those parties; and they haven'tany bottled fragments of saints, and not even a nail from the true cross.We are going to Rome. There is nothing to see here.
