Joan Stands Defiant Before the Rack
THE BRILLIANT weather, the heavenly weather, the bewitching weather madeeverybody's heart to sing, as I have told you; yes, Rouen was feelinglight-hearted and gay, and most willing and ready to break out and laughupon the least occasion; and so when the news went around that the younggirl in the tower had scored another defeat against Bishop Cauchon therewas abundant laughter--abundant laughter among the citizens of bothparties, for they all hated the Bishop. It is true, the English-heartedmajority of the people wanted Joan burned, but that did not keep themfrom laughing at the man they hated. It would have been perilous foranybody to laugh at the English chiefs or at the majority of Cauchon'sassistant judges, but to laugh at Cauchon or D'Estivet and Loyseleur wassafe--nobody would report it.
The difference between Cauchon and cochon [1] was not noticeable inspeech, and so there was plenty of opportunity for puns; theopportunities were not thrown away.
Some of the jokes got well worn in the course of two or three months,from repeated use; for every time Cauchon started a new trial the folksaid "The sow has littered [2] again"; and every time the trial failedthey said it over again, with its other meaning, "The hog has made a messof it."
And so, on the third of May, Noel and I, drifting about the town, heardmany a wide-mouthed lout let go his joke and his laugh, and then move tothe next group, proud of his wit and happy, to work it off again:
"'Od's blood, the sow has littered five times, and five times has made amess of it!"
And now and then one was bold enough to say--but he said it softly:
"Sixty-three and the might of England against a girl, and she camps onthe field five times!"
Cauchon lived in the great palace of the Archbishop, and it was guardedby English soldiery; but no matter, there was never a dark night but thewalls showed next morning that the rude joker had been there with hispaint and brush. Yes, he had been thee, and had smeared the sacred wallswith pictures of hogs in all attitudes except flattering ones; hogsclothed in a Bishop's vestments and wearing a Bishop's miter irreverentlycocked on the side of their heads.
Cauchon raged and cursed over his defeats and his impotence during sevensays; then he conceived a new scheme. You shall see what it was; for youhave not cruel hearts, and you would never guess it.
On the ninth of May there was a summons, and Manchon and I got outmaterials together and started. But this time we were to go to one of theother towers--not the one which was Joan's prison. It was round and grimand massive, and built of the plainest and thickest and solidestmasonry--a dismal and forbidding structure. [3] We entered the circularroom on the ground floor, and I saw what turned me sick--the instrumentsof torture and the executioners standing ready! Here you have the blackheart of Cauchon at the blackest, here you have the proof that in hisnature there was no such thing as pity. One wonders if he ever knew hismother or ever had a sister.
Cauchon was there, and the Vice-Inquisitor and the Abbot of St.Corneille; also six others, among them that false Loyseleur. The guardswere in their places, the rack was there, and by it stood the executionerand his aids in their crimson hose and doublets, meet color for theirbloody trade. The picture of Joan rose before me stretched upon the rack,her feet tied to one end of it, her wrists to the other, and those redgiants turning the windlass and pulling her limbs out of their sockets.It seemed to me that I could hear the bones snap and the flesh tearapart, and I did not see how that body of anointed servants of themerciful Jesus could sit there and look so placid and indifferent.
After a little, Joan arrived and was brought in. She saw the rack, shesaw the attendants, and the same picture which I had been seeing musthave risen in her mind; but do you think she quailed, do you think sheshuddered? No, there was no sign of that sort. She straightened herselfup, and there was a slight curl of scorn about her lip; but as for fear,she showed not a vestige of it.
This was a memorable session, but it was the shortest one of all thelist. When Joan had taken her seat a rsum of her "crimes" was read toher. Then Cauchon made a solemn speech. It in he said that in the courseof her several trials Joan had refused to answer some of the questionsand had answered others with lies, but that now he was going to have thetruth out of her, and the whole of it.
Her manner was full of confidence this time; he was sure he had found away at last to break this child's stubborn spirit and make her beg andcry. He would score a victory this time and stop the mouths of the jokersof Rouen. You see, he was only just a man after all, and couldn't standridicule any better than other people. He talked high, and his splotchyface lighted itself up with all the shifting tints and signs of evilpleasure and promised triumph--purple, yellow, red, green--they were allthere, with sometimes the dull and spongy blue of a drowned man, theuncanniest of them all. And finally he burst out in a great passion andsaid:
"There is the rack, and there are its ministers! You will reveal all nowor be put to the torture.
"Speak."
Then she made that great answer which will live forever; made it withoutfuss or bravado, and yet how fine and noble was the sound of it:
"I will tell you nothing more than I have told you; no, not even if youtear the limbs from my body. And even if in my pain I did say somethingotherwise, I would always say afterward that it was the torture thatspoke and not I."
There was no crushing that spirit. You should have seen Cauchon. Defeatedagain, and he had not dreamed of such a thing. I heard it said the nextday, around the town, that he had a full confession all written out, inhis pocket and all ready for Joan to sign. I do not know that that wastrue, but it probably was, for her mark signed at the bottom of aconfession would be the kind of evidence (for effect with the public)which Cauchon and his people were particularly value, you know.
No, there was no crushing that spirit, and no beclouding that clear mind.Consider the depth, the wisdom of that answer, coming from an ignorantgirl. Why, there were not six men in the world who had ever reflectedthat words forced out of a person by horrible tortures were notnecessarily words of verity and truth, yet this unlettered peasant-girlput her finger upon that flaw with an unerring instinct. I had alwayssupposed that torture brought out the truth--everybody supposed it; andwhen Joan came out with those simple common-sense words they seemed toflood the place with light. It was like a lightning-flash at midnightwhich suddenly reveals a fair valley sprinkled over with silver streamsand gleaming villages and farmsteads where was only an impenetrable worldof darkness before. Manchon stole a sidewise look at me, and his face wasfull of surprise; and there was the like to be seen in other faces there.Consider--they were old, and deeply cultured, yet here was a village maidable to teach them something which they had not known before. I heard oneof them mutter:
"Verily it is a wonderful creature. She has laid her hand upon anaccepted truth that is as old as the world, and it has crumbled to dustand rubbish under her touch. Now whence got she that marvelous insight?"
The judges laid their heads together and began to talk now. It was plain,from chance words which one caught now and then, that Cauchon andLoyseleur were insisting upon the application of the torture, and thatmost of the others were urgently objecting.
Finally Cauchon broke out with a good deal of asperity in his voice andordered Joan back to her dungeon. That was a happy surprise for me. I wasnot expecting that the Bishop would yield.
When Manchon came home that night he said he had found out why thetorture was not applied.
There were two reasons. One was, a fear that Joan might die under thetorture, which would not suit the English at all; the other was, that thetorture would effect nothing if Joan was going to take back everythingshe said under its pains; and as to putting her mark to a confession, itwas believed that not even the rack would ever make her do that.
So all Rouen laughed again, and kept it up for three days, saying:
"The sow has littered six times, and made six messes of it."
And the palace walls got a new decoration--a mitered hog carrying adiscarded rack home on its shoulder, and Loyseleur weeping in its wake.Many rewards were offered for the capture of these painters, but nobodyapplied. Even the English guard feigned blindness and would not see theartists at work.
The Bishop's anger was very high now. He could not reconcile himself tothe idea of giving up the torture. It was the pleasantest idea he hadinvented yet, and he would not cast it by. So he called in some of hissatellites on the twelfth, and urged the torture again. But it was afailure.
With some, Joan's speech had wrought an effect; others feared she mightdie under torture; others did not believe that any amount of sufferingcould make her put her mark to a lying confession. There were fourteenmen present, including the Bishop. Eleven of them voted dead against thetorture, and stood their ground in spite of Cauchon's abuse. Two votedwith the Bishop and insisted upon the torture. These two were Loyseleurand the orator--the man whom Joan had bidden to "read his book"--Thomasde Courcelles, the renowned pleader and master of eloquence.
Age has taught me charity of speech; but it fails me when I think ofthose three names--Cauchon, Courcelles, Loyseleur.
