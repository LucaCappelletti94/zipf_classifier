To succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown; in the law,concealment of it will do. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
MONDAY,--December 23, 1895. Sailed from Sydney for Ceylon in the P. & O.steamer 'Oceana'. A Lascar crew mans this ship--the first I have seen.White cotton petticoat and pants; barefoot; red shawl for belt; strawcap, brimless, on head, with red scarf wound around it; complexion a richdark brown; short straight black hair; whiskers fine and silky; lustrousand intensely black. Mild, good faces; willing and obedient people;capable, too; but are said to go into hopeless panics when there isdanger. They are from Bombay and the coast thereabouts. Left some ofthe trunks in Sydney, to be shipped to South Africa by a vesseladvertised to sail three months hence. The proverb says: "Separate notyourself from your baggage."
This 'Oceana' is a stately big ship, luxuriously appointed. She hasspacious promenade decks. Large rooms; a surpassingly comfortable ship.The officers' library is well selected; a ship's library is not usuallythat . . . . For meals, the bugle call, man-of-war fashion; apleasant change from the terrible gong . . . . Three big cats--veryfriendly loafers; they wander all over the ship; the white one followsthe chief steward around like a dog. There is also a basket of kittens.One of these cats goes ashore, in port, in England, Australia, and India,to see how his various families are getting along, and is seen no moretill the ship is ready to sail. No one knows how he finds out thesailing date, but no doubt he comes down to the dock every day and takesa look, and when he sees baggage and passengers flocking in, recognizesthat it is time to get aboard. This is what the sailors believe. TheChief Engineer has been in the China and India trade thirty three years,and has had but three Christmases at home in that time . . . .Conversational items at dinner, "Mocha! sold all over the world! It isnot true. In fact, very few foreigners except the Emperor of Russia haveever seen a grain of it, or ever will, while they live." Another mansaid: "There is no sale in Australia for Australian wine. But it goes toFrance and comes back with a French label on it, and then they buy it."I have heard that the most of the French-labeled claret in New York ismade in California. And I remember what Professor S. told me once aboutVeuve Cliquot--if that was the wine, and I think it was. He was theguest of a great wine merchant whose town was quite near that vineyard,and this merchant asked him if very much V. C. was drunk in America.
"Oh, yes," said S., "a great abundance of it."
"Is it easy to be had?"
"Oh, yes--easy as water. All first and second-class hotels have it."
"What do you pay for it?"
"It depends on the style of the hotel--from fifteen to twenty-five francsa bottle."
"Oh, fortunate country! Why, it's worth 100 francs right here on theground."
"No!"
"Yes!"
"Do you mean that we are drinking a bogus Veuve-Cliquot over there?"
"Yes--and there was never a bottle of the genuine in America sinceColumbus's time. That wine all comes from a little bit of a patch ofground which isn't big enough to raise many bottles; and all of it thatis produced goes every year to one person--the Emperor of Russia. Hetakes the whole crop in advance, be it big or little."
January 4, 1898. Christmas in Melbourne, New Year's Day in Adelaide,and saw most of the friends again in both places . . . . Lying hereat anchor all day--Albany (King George's Sound), Western Australia. Itis a perfectly landlocked harbor, or roadstead--spacious to look at, butnot deep water. Desolate-looking rocks and scarred hills. Plenty ofships arriving now, rushing to the new gold-fields. The papers are fullof wonderful tales of the sort always to be heard in connection with newgold diggings. A sample: a youth staked out a claim and tried to sellhalf for L5; no takers; he stuck to it fourteen days, starving, thenstruck it rich and sold out for L10,000 . . . . About sunset, strongbreeze blowing, got up the anchor. We were in a small deep puddle, witha narrow channel leading out of it, minutely buoyed, to the sea.
I stayed on deck to see how we were going to manage it with such a bigship and such a strong wind. On the bridge our giant captain, inuniform; at his side a little pilot in elaborately gold-laced uniform; onthe forecastle a white mate and quartermaster or two, and a brilliantcrowd of lascars standing by for business. Our stern was pointingstraight at the head of the channel; so we must turn entirely around inthe puddle--and the wind blowing as described. It was done, andbeautifully. It was done by help of a jib. We stirred up much mud, butdid not touch the bottom. We turned right around in our tracks--aseeming impossibility. We had several casts of quarter-less 5, and onecast of half 4--27 feet; we were drawing 26 astern. By the time we wereentirely around and pointed, the first buoy was not more than a hundredyards in front of us. It was a fine piece of work, and I was the onlypassenger that saw it. However, the others got their dinner; the P. & O.Company got mine . . . . More cats developed. Smythe says it is aBritish law that they must be carried; and he instanced a case of a shipnot allowed to sail till she sent for a couple. The bill came, too:"Debtor, to 2 cats, 20 shillings." . . . News comes that within thisweek Siam has acknowledged herself to be, in effect, a French province.It seems plain that all savage and semi-civilized countries are going tobe grabbed . . . . A vulture on board; bald, red, queer-shaped head,featherless red places here and there on his body, intense great blackeyes set in featherless rims of inflamed flesh; dissipated look; abusinesslike style, a selfish, conscienceless, murderous aspect--the verylook of a professional assassin, and yet a bird which does no murder.What was the use of getting him up in that tragic style for so innocent atrade as his? For this one isn't the sort that wars upon the living, hisdiet is offal--and the more out of date it is the better he likes it.Nature should give him a suit of rusty black; then he would be all right,for he would look like an undertaker and would harmonize with hisbusiness; whereas the way he is now he is horribly out of true.
January 5. At 9 this morning we passed Cape Leeuwin (lioness) andceased from our long due-west course along the southern shore ofAustralia. Turning this extreme southwestern corner, we now take a longstraight slant nearly N. W., without a break, for Ceylon. As we speednorthward it will grow hotter very fast--but it isn't chilly, now. . . .The vulture is from the public menagerie at Adelaide--a great andinteresting collection. It was there that we saw the baby tiger solemnlyspreading its mouth and trying to roar like its majestic mother. Itswaggered, scowling, back and forth on its short legs just as it had seenher do on her long ones, and now and then snarling viciously, exposingits teeth, with a threatening lift of its upper lip and bristlingmoustache; and when it thought it was impressing the visitors, it wouldspread its mouth wide and do that screechy cry which it meant for a roar,but which did not deceive. It took itself quite seriously, and waslovably comical. And there was a hyena--an ugly creature; as ugly as thetiger-kitty was pretty. It repeatedly arched its back and delivereditself of such a human cry; a startling resemblance; a cry which was justthat of a grown person badly hurt. In the dark one would assuredly go toits assistance--and be disappointed . . . . Many friends ofAustralasian Federation on board. They feel sure that the good day isnot far off, now. But there seems to be a party that would go further--have Australasia cut loose from the British Empire and set uphousekeeping on her own hook. It seems an unwise idea. They point tothe United States, but it seems to me that the cases lack a good deal ofbeing alike. Australasia governs herself wholly--there is nointerference; and her commerce and manufactures are not oppressed in anyway. If our case had been the same we should not have gone out when wedid.
January 13. Unspeakably hot. The equator is arriving again. We arewithin eight degrees of it. Ceylon present. Dear me, it is beautiful!And most sumptuously tropical, as to character of foliage and opulence ofit. "What though the spicy breezes blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle"--aneloquent line, an incomparable line; it says little, but conveys wholelibraries of sentiment, and Oriental charm and mystery, and tropicdeliciousness--a line that quivers and tingles with a thousandunexpressed and inexpressible things, things that haunt one and find noarticulate voice . . . . Colombo, the capital. An Oriental town,most manifestly; and fascinating.
In this palatial ship the passengers dress for dinner. The ladies'toilettes make a fine display of color, and this is in keeping with theelegance of the vessel's furnishings and the flooding brilliancies of theelectric light. On the stormy Atlantic one never sees a man in eveningdress, except at the rarest intervals; and then there is only one, nottwo; and he shows up but once on the voyage--the night before the shipmakes port--the night when they have the "concert" and do the amateurwailings and recitations. He is the tenor, as a rule . . . . Therehas been a deal of cricket-playing on board; it seems a queer game for aship, but they enclose the promenade deck with nettings and keep the ballfrom flying overboard, and the sport goes very well, and is properlyviolent and exciting . . . . We must part from this vessel here.
January 14. Hotel Bristol. Servant Brompy. Alert, gentle, smiling,winning young brown creature as ever was. Beautiful shining black haircombed back like a woman's, and knotted at the back of his head--tortoise-shell comb in it, sign that he is a Singhalese; slender, shapelyform; jacket; under it is a beltless and flowing white cotton gown--fromneck straight to heel; he and his outfit quite unmasculine. It was anembarrassment to undress before him.
We drove to the market, using the Japanese jinriksha--our firstacquaintanceship with it. It is a light cart, with a native to draw it.He makes good speed for half-an-hour, but it is hard work for him; he istoo slight for it. After the half-hour there is no more pleasure foryou; your attention is all on the man, just as it would be on a tiredhorse, and necessarily your sympathy is there too. There's a plenty ofthese 'rickshas, and the tariff is incredibly cheap.
I was in Cairo years ago. That was Oriental, but there was a lack. Whenyou are in Florida or New Orleans you are in the South--that is granted;but you are not in the South; you are in a modified South, a temperedSouth. Cairo was a tempered Orient--an Orient with an indefinitesomething wanting. That feeling was not present in Ceylon. Ceylon wasOriental in the last measure of completeness--utterly Oriental; alsoutterly tropical; and indeed to one's unreasoning spiritual sense the twothings belong together. All the requisites were present. The costumeswere right; the black and brown exposures, unconscious of immodesty, wereright; the juggler was there, with his basket, his snakes, his mongoose,and his arrangements for growing a tree from seed to foliage and ripefruitage before one's eyes; in sight were plants and flowers familiar toone on books but in no other way celebrated, desirable, strange, but inproduction restricted to the hot belt of the equator; and out a littleway in the country were the proper deadly snakes, and fierce beasts ofprey, and the wild elephant and the monkey. And there was that swoon inthe air which one associates with the tropics, and that smother of heat,heavy with odors of unknown flowers, and that sudden invasion of purplegloom fissured with lightnings,--then the tumult of crashing thunder andthe downpour and presently all sunny and smiling again; all these thingswere there; the conditions were complete, nothing was lacking. And awayoff in the deeps of the jungle and in the remotenesses of the mountainswere the ruined cities and mouldering temples, mysterious relics of thepomps of a forgotten time and a vanished race--and this was as it shouldbe, also, for nothing is quite satisfyingly Oriental that lacks thesomber and impressive qualities of mystery and antiquity.
The drive through the town and out to the Galle Face by the seashore,what a dream it was of tropical splendors of bloom and blossom, andOriental conflagrations of costume! The walking groups of men, women,boys, girls, babies--each individual was a flame, each group a houseafire for color. And such stunning colors, such intensely vivid colors,such rich and exquisite minglings and fusings of rainbows and lightnings!And all harmonious, all in perfect taste; never a discordant note; nevera color on any person swearing at another color on him or failing toharmonize faultlessly with the colors of any group the wearer might join.The stuffs were silk-thin, soft, delicate, clinging; and, as a rule, eachpiece a solid color: a splendid green, a splendid blue, a splendidyellow, a splendid purple, a splendid ruby, deep, and rich withsmouldering fires they swept continuously by in crowds and legions andmultitudes, glowing, flashing, burning, radiant; and every five secondscame a burst of blinding red that made a body catch his breath, andfilled his heart with joy. And then, the unimaginable grace of thosecostumes! Sometimes a woman's whole dress was but a scarf wound abouther person and her head, sometimes a man's was but a turban and acareless rag or two--in both cases generous areas of polished dark skinshowing--but always the arrangement compelled the homage of the eye andmade the heart sing for gladness.
I can see it to this day, that radiant panorama, that wilderness of richcolor, that incomparable dissolving-view of harmonious tints, and lithehalf-covered forms, and beautiful brown faces, and gracious and gracefulgestures and attitudes and movements, free, unstudied, barren ofstiffness and restraint, and--
Just then, into this dream of fairyland and paradise a grating dissonancewas injected.
Out of a missionary school came marching, two and two, sixteen prim andpious little Christian black girls, Europeanly clothed--dressed, to thelast detail, as they would have been dressed on a summer Sunday in anEnglish or American village. Those clothes--oh, they were unspeakablyugly! Ugly, barbarous, destitute of taste, destitute of grace, repulsiveas a shroud. I looked at my womenfolk's clothes--just full-grownduplicates of the outrages disguising those poor little abused creatures--and was ashamed to be seen in the street with them. Then I looked atmy own clothes, and was ashamed to be seen in the street with myself.
However, we must put up with our clothes as they are--they have theirreason for existing. They are on us to expose us--to advertise what wewear them to conceal. They are a sign; a sign of insincerity; a sign ofsuppressed vanity; a pretense that we despise gorgeous colors and thegraces of harmony and form; and we put them on to propagate that lie andback it up. But we do not deceive our neighbor; and when we step intoCeylon we realize that we have not even deceived ourselves. We do lovebrilliant colors and graceful costumes; and at home we will turn out in astorm to see them when the procession goes by--and envy the wearers. Wego to the theater to look at them and grieve that we can't be clothedlike that. We go to the King's ball, when we get a chance, and are gladof a sight of the splendid uniforms and the glittering orders. When weare granted permission to attend an imperial drawing-room we shutourselves up in private and parade around in the theatrical court-dressby the hour, and admire ourselves in the glass, and are utterly happy;and every member of every governor's staff in democratic America does thesame with his grand new uniform--and if he is not watched he will gethimself photographed in it, too. When I see the Lord Mayor's footman Iam dissatisfied with my lot. Yes, our clothes are a lie, and have beennothing short of that these hundred years. They are insincere, they arethe ugly and appropriate outward exposure of an inward sham and a moraldecay.
The last little brown boy I chanced to notice in the crowds and swarms ofColombo had nothing on but a twine string around his waist, but in mymemory the frank honesty of his costume still stands out in pleasantcontrast with the odious flummery in which the little Sunday-schooldowdies were masquerading.
