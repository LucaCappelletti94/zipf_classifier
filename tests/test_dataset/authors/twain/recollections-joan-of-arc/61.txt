Joan's Master-Stroke Diverted
NOW, as a next move, this small secret court of holy assassins did athing so base that even at this day, in my old age, it is hard to speakof it with patience.
In the beginning of her commerce with her Voices there at Domremy, thechild Joan solemnly devoted her life to God, vowing her pure body and herpure soul to His service. You will remember that her parents tried tostop her from going to the wars by haling her to the court at Toul tocompel her to make a marriage which she had never promised to make--amarriage with our poor, good, windy, big, hard-fighting, and most dearand lamented comrade, the Standard-Bearer, who fell in honorable battleand sleeps with God these sixty years, peace to his ashes! And you willremember how Joan, sixteen years old, stood up in that venerable courtand conducted her case all by herself, and tore the poor Paladin's caseto rags and blew it away with a breath; and how the astonished old judgeon the bench spoke of her as "this marvelous child."
You remember all that. Then think what I felt, to see these falsepriests, here in the tribunal wherein Joan had fought a fourth lone fightin three years, deliberately twist that matter entirely around and try tomake out that Joan haled the Paladin into court and pretended that he hadpromised to marry her, and was bent on making him do it.
Certainly there was no baseness that those people were ashamed to stoopto in their hunt for that friendless girl's life. What they wanted toshow was this--that she had committed the sin of relapsing from her vowand trying to violate it.
Joan detailed the true history of the case, but lost her temper as shewent along, and finished with some words for Cauchon which he remembersyet, whether he is fanning himself in the world he belongs in or hasswindled his way into the other.
The rest of this day and part of the next the court labored upon the oldtheme--the male attire. It was shabby work for those grave men to beengaged in; for they well knew one of Joan's reasons for clinging to themale dress was, that soldiers of the guard were always present in herroom whether she was asleep or awake, and that the male dress was abetter protection for her modesty than the other.
The court knew that one of Joan's purposes had been the deliverance ofthe exiled Duke of Orleans, and they were curious to know how she hadintended to manage it. Her plan was characteristically businesslike, andher statement of it as characteristically simple and straightforward:
"I would have taken English prisoners enough in France for his ransom;and failing that, I would have invaded England and brought him out byforce."
That was just her way. If a thing was to be done, it was love first, andhammer and tongs to follow; but no shilly-shallying between. She addedwith a little sigh:
"If I had had my freedom three years, I would have delivered him."
"Have you the permission of your Voices to break out of prison wheneveryou can?"
"I have asked their leave several times, but they have not given it."
I think it is as I have said, she expected the deliverance of death, andwithin the prison walls, before the three months should expire.
"Would you escape if you saw the doors open?"
She spoke up frankly and said:
"Yes--for I should see in that the permission of Our Lord. God helps whohelp themselves, the proverb says. But except I thought I had permission,I would not go."
Now, then, at this point, something occurred which convinces me, everytime I think of it--and it struck me so at the time--that for a moment,at least, her hopes wandered to the King, and put into her mind the samenotion about her deliverance which Noel and I had settled upon--a rescueby her old soldiers. I think the idea of the rescue did occur to her, butonly as a passing thought, and that it quickly passed away.
Some remark of the Bishop of Beauvais moved her to remind him once morethat he was an unfair judge, and had no right to preside there, and thathe was putting himself in great danger.
"What danger?" he asked.
"I do not know. St. Catherine has promised me help, but I do not know theform of it. I do not know whether I am to be delivered from this prisonor whether when you sent me to the scaffold there will happen a troubleby which I shall be set free. Without much thought as to this matter, Iam of the opinion that it may be one or the other." After a pause sheadded these words, memorable forever--words whose meaning she may havemiscaught, misunderstood; as to that we can never know; words which shemay have rightly understood, as to that, also, we can never know; butwords whose mystery fell away from them many a year ago and revealedtheir meaning to all the world:
"But what my Voices have said clearest is, that I shall be delivered by agreat victory." She paused, my heart was beating fast, for to me thatgreat victory meant the sudden bursting in of our old soldiers with thewar-cry and clash of steel at the last moment and the carrying off ofJoan of Arc in triumph. But, oh, that thought had such a short life! Fornow she raised her head and finished, with those solemn words which menstill so often quote and dwell upon--words which filled me with fear,they sounded so like a prediction. "And always they say 'Submit towhatever comes; do not grieve for your martyrdom; from it you will ascendinto the Kingdom of Paradise."
Was she thinking of fire and the stake? I think not. I thought of itmyself, but I believe she was only thinking of this slow and cruelmartyrdom of chains and captivity and insult. Surely, martyrdom was theright name for it.
It was Jean de la Fontaine who was asking the questions. He was willingto make the most he could out of what she had said:
"As the Voices have told you you are going to Paradise, you feel certainthat that will happen and that you will not be damned in hell. Is thatso?"
"I believe what they told me. I know that I shall be saved."
"It is a weighty answer."
"To me the knowledge that I shall be saved is a great treasure."
"Do you think that after that revelation you could be able to commitmortal sin?"
"As to that, I do not know. My hope for salvation is in holding fast tomy oath to keep by body and my soul pure."
"Since you know you are to be saved, do you think it necessary to go toconfession?"
The snare was ingeniously devised, but Joan's simple and humble answerleft it empty:
"One cannot keep his conscience too clean."
We were now arriving at the last day of this new trial. Joan had comethrough the ordeal well. It had been a long and wearisome struggle forall concerned. All ways had been tried to convict the accused, and allhad failed, thus far. The inquisitors were thoroughly vexed anddissatisfied.
However, they resolved to make one more effort, put in one more day'swork. This was done--March 17th. Early in the sitting a notable trap wasset for Joan:
"Will you submit to the determination of the Church all your words anddeeds, whether good or bad?"
That was well planned. Joan was in imminent peril now. If she shouldheedlessly say yes, it would put her mission itself upon trial, and onewould know how to decide its source and character promptly. If she shouldsay no, she would render herself chargeable with the crime of heresy.
But she was equal to the occasion. She drew a distinct line of separationbetween the Church's authority over her as a subject member, and thematter of her mission. She said she loved the Church and was ready tosupport the Christian faith with all her strength; but as to the worksdone under her mission, those must be judged by God alone, who hadcommanded them to be done.
The judge still insisted that she submit them to the decision of theChurch. She said:
"I will submit them to Our Lord who sent me. It would seem to me that Heand His Church are one, and that there should be no difficulty about thismatter." Then she turned upon the judge and said, "Why do you make adifficulty when there is no room for any?"
Then Jean de la Fontaine corrected her notion that there was but oneChurch. There were two--the Church Triumphant, which is God, the saints,the angels, and the redeemed, and has its seat in heave; and the ChurchMilitant, which is our Holy Father the Pope, Vicar of God, the prelates,the clergy and all good Christians and Catholics, the which Church hasits seat in the earth, is governed by the Holy Spirit, and cannot err."Will you not submit those matters to the Church Militant?"
"I am come to the King of France from the Church Triumphant on high byits commandant, and to that Church I will submit all those things which Ihave done. For the Church Militant I have no other answer now."
The court took note of this straitly worded refusal, and would hope toget profit out of it; but the matter was dropped for the present, and along chase was then made over the old hunting-ground--the fairies, thevisions, the male attire, and all that.
In the afternoon the satanic Bishop himself took the chair and presidedover the closing scenes of the trial. Along toward the finish, thisquestion was asked by one of the judges:
"You have said to my lord the Bishop that you would answer him as youwould answer before our Holy Father the Pope, and yet there are severalquestions which you continually refuse to answer. Would you not answerthe Pope more fully than you have answered before my lord of Beauvais?Would you not feel obliged to answer the Pope, who is the Vicar of God,more fully?"
Now a thunder-clap fell out of a clear sky:
"Take me to the Pope. I will answer to everything that I ought to."
It made the Bishop's purple face fairly blanch with consternation. IfJoan had only known, if she had only know! She had lodged a mine underthis black conspiracy able to blow the Bishop's schemes to the four windsof heaven, and she didn't know it. She had made that speech by mereinstinct, not suspecting what tremendous forces were hidden in it, andthere was none to tell her what she had done. I knew, and Manchon knew;and if she had known how to read writing we could have hoped to get theknowledge to her somehow; but speech was the only way, and none wasallowed to approach her near enough for that. So there she sat, once moreJoan of Arc the Victorious, but all unconscious of it. She was miserablyworn and tired, by the long day's struggle and by illness, or she musthave noticed the effect of that speech and divined the reason of it.
She had made many master-strokes, but this was the master-stroke. It wasan appeal to Rome. It was her clear right; and if she had persisted in itCauchon's plot would have tumbled about his ears like a house of cards,and he would have gone from that place the worst-beaten man of thecentury. He was daring, but he was not daring enough to stand up againstthat demand if Joan had urged it. But no, she was ignorant, poor thing,and did not know what a blow she had struck for life and liberty.
France was not the Church. Rome had no interest in the destruction ofthis messenger of God.
Rome would have given her a fair trial, and that was all that her causeneeded. From that trial she would have gone forth free, and honored, andblessed.
But it was not so fated. Cauchon at once diverted the questions to othermatters and hurried the trial quickly to an end.
As Joan moved feebly away, dragging her chains, I felt stunned and dazed,and kept saying to myself, "Such a little while ago she said the savingword and could have gone free; and now, there she goes to her death; yes,it is to her death, I know it, I feel it. They will double the guards;they will never let any come near her now between this and hercondemnation, lest she get a hint and speak that word again. This is thebitterest day that has come to me in all this miserable time."
