This line of hieroglyphics was for fourteen years thedespair of all the scholars who labored over the mysteries of theRosetta stone: [Figure 1]After five years of study Champollion translated it thus:Therefore let the worship of Epiphanes be maintained in allthe temples, this upon pain of death.That was the twenty-forth translation that had beenfurnished by scholars. For a time it stood. But only for atime. Then doubts began to assail it and undermine it, and thescholars resumed their labors. Three years of patient workproduced eleven new translations; among them, this, byGr:unfeldt, was received with considerable favor:The horse of Epiphanes shall be maintained at the public expense;this upon pain of death.But the following rendering, by Gospodin, was received bythe learned world with yet greater favor:The priest shall explain the wisdom of Epiphanes to all these people,and these shall listen with reverence, upon pain of death.Seven years followed, in which twenty-one fresh and widelyvarying renderings were scored--none of them quite convincing.But now, at last, came Rawlinson, the youngest of all thescholars, with a translation which was immediately anduniversally recognized as being the correct version, and his namebecame famous in a day. So famous, indeed, that even thechildren were familiar with it; and such a noise did theachievement itself make that not even the noise of the monumentalpolitical event of that same year--the flight from Elba--was ableto smother it to silence. Rawlinson's version reads as follows:Therefore, walk not away from the wisdom of Epiphanes, butturn and follow it; so shall it conduct thee to the temple'speace, and soften for thee the sorrows of life and the pains ofdeath.Here is another difficult text: [Figure 2]It is demotic--a style of Egyptian writing and a phase ofthe language which has perished from the knowledge of all mentwenty-five hundred years before the Christian era.Our red Indians have left many records, in the form ofpictures, upon our crags and boulders. It has taken our mostgifted and painstaking students two centuries to get at themeanings hidden in these pictures; yet there are still two littlelines of hieroglyphics among the figures grouped upon the DightonRocks which they have not succeeds in interpreting to theirsatisfaction. These: [Figure 3]The suggested solutions are practically innumerable; theywould fill a book.Thus we have infinite trouble in solving man-made mysteries;it is only when we set out to discover the secret of God that ourdifficulties disappear. It was always so. In antique Romantimes it was the custom of the Deity to try to conceal Hisintentions in the entrails of birds, and this was patiently andhopefully continued century after century, although the attemptedconcealment never succeeded, in a single recorded instance. Theaugurs could read entrails as easily as a modern child can readcoarse print. Roman history is full of the marvels ofinterpretation which these extraordinary men performed. Thesestrange and wonderful achievements move our awe and compel ouradmiration. Those men could pierce to the marrow of a mysteryinstantly. If the Rosetta-stone idea had been introduced itwould have defeated them, but entrails had no embarrassments forthem. Entrails have gone out, now--entrails and dreams. It wasat last found out that as hiding-places for the divine intentionsthey were inadequate.A part of the wall of Valletri in former times been struckwith thunder, the response of the soothsayers was, that a nativeof that town would some time or other arrive at supreme power.--BOHN'S SUETONIUS, p. 138."Some time or other." It looks indefinite, but no matter,it happened, all the same; one needed only to wait, and bepatient, and keep watch, then he would find out that the thunder-stroke had Caesar Augustus in mind, and had come to give notice.There were other advance-advertisements. One of themappeared just before Caesar Augustus was born, and was mostpoetic and touching and romantic in its feelings and aspects.It was a dream. It was dreamed by Caesar Augustus's mother,and interpreted at the usual rates:Atia, before her delivery, dreamed that her bowels stretchedto the stars and expanded through the whole circuit of heavenand earth.--SUETONIUS, p. 139.That was in the augur's line, and furnished him nodifficulties, but it would have taken Rawlinson and Champollionfourteen years to make sure of what it meant, because they wouldhave been surprised and dizzy. It would have been too late to bevaluable, then, and the bill for service would have been barredby the statute of limitation.In those old Roman days a gentleman's education was notcomplete until he had taken a theological course at the seminaryand learned how to translate entrails. Caesar Augustus'seducation received this final polish. All through his life,whenever he had poultry on the menu he saved the interiors andkept himself informed of the Deity's plans by exercising uponthose interiors the arts of augury.In his first consulship, while he was observing theauguries, twelve vultures presented themselves, as they had doneto Romulus. And when he offered sacrifice, the livers of allthe victims were folded inward in the lower part; a circumstancewhich was regarded by those present who had skill in things ofthat nature, as an indubitable prognostic of great and wonderfulfortune.--SUETONIUS, p. 141."Indubitable" is a strong word, but no doubt it wasjustified, if the livers were really turned that way. In thosedays chicken livers were strangely and delicately sensitive tocoming events, no matter how far off they might be; and theycould never keep still, but would curl and squirm like that,particularly when vultures came and showed interest in thatapproaching great event and in breakfast.[=]IIWe may now skip eleven hundred and thirty or forty years,which brings us down to enlightened Christian times and thetroubled days of King Stephen of England. The augur has had hisday and has been long ago forgotten; the priest had fallen heirto his trade.King Henry is dead; Stephen, that bold and outrageousperson, comes flying over from Normandy to steal the throne fromHenry's daughter. He accomplished his crime, and Henry ofHuntington, a priest of high degree, mourns over it in hisChronicle. The Archbishop of Canterbury consecrated Stephen:"wherefore the Lord visited the Archbishop with the same judgmentwhich he had inflicted upon him who struck Jeremiah the greatpriest: he died with a year."Stephen's was the greater offense, but Stephen could wait;not so the Archbishop, apparently.The kingdom was a prey to intestine wars; slaughter, fire,and rapine spread ruin throughout the land; cries of distress,horror, and woe rose in every quarter.That was the result of Stephen's crime. These unspeakableconditions continued during nineteen years. Then Stephen died ascomfortably as any man ever did, and was honorably buried. Itmakes one pity the poor Archbishop, and with that he, too, couldhave been let off as leniently. How did Henry of Huntington knowthat the Archbishop was sent to his grave by judgment of God forconsecrating Stephen? He does not explain. Neither does heexplain why Stephen was awarded a pleasanter death than he wasentitled to, while the aged King Henry, his predecessor, who hadruled England thirty-five years to the people's strongly wordedsatisfaction, was condemned to close his life in circumstancesmost distinctly unpleasant, inconvenient, and disagreeable. Hiswas probably the most uninspiring funeral that is set down inhistory. There is not a detail about it that is attractive. Itseems to have been just the funeral for Stephen, and even at thisfar-distant day it is matter of just regret that by anindiscretion the wrong man got it.Whenever God punishes a man, Henry of Huntington knows whyit was done, and tells us; and his pen is eloquent withadmiration; but when a man has earned punishment, and escapes, hedoes not explain. He is evidently puzzled, but he does not sayanything. I think it is often apparent that he is pained bythese discrepancies, but loyally tries his best not to show it.When he cannot praise, he delivers himself of a silence so markedthat a suspicious person could mistake it for suppressedcriticism. However, he has plenty of opportunities to feelcontented with the way things go--his book is full of them.King David of Scotland . . . under color of religion causedhis followers to deal most barbarously with the English. Theyripped open women, tossed children on the points of spears,butchered priests at the altars, and, cutting off the heads fromthe images on crucifixes, placed them on the bodies of the slain,while in exchange they fixed on the crucifixes the heads of theirvictims. Wherever the Scots came, there was the same scene ofhorror and cruelty: women shrieking, old men lamenting, amid thegroans of the dying and the despair of the living.But the English got the victory.Then the chief of the men of Lothian fell, pierced by an arrow,and all his followers were put to flight. For the Almighty wasoffended at them and their strength was rent like a cobweb.Offended at them for what? For committing those fearfulbutcheries? No, for that was the common custom on both sides,and not open to criticism. Then was it for doing the butcheries"under cover of religion"? No, that was not it; religiousfeeling was often expressed in that fervent way all through thoseold centuries. The truth is, He was not offended at "them" at all;He was only offended at their king, who had been false to an oath.Then why did not He put the punishment upon the king instead ofupon "them"? It is a difficult question. One can see by theChronicle that the "judgments" fell rather customarily uponthe wrong person, but Henry of Huntington does not explain why.Here is one that went true; the chronicler's satisfactionin it is not hidden:In the month of August, Providence displayed its justice ina remarkable manner; for two of the nobles who had convertedmonasteries into fortifications, expelling the monks, their sinbeing the same, met with a similar punishment. Robert Marmionwas one, Godfrey de Mandeville the other. Robert Marmion,issuing forth against the enemy, was slain under the walls of themonastery, being the only one who fell, though he was surroundedby his troops. Dying excommunicated, he became subject to deatheverlasting. In like manner Earl Godfrey was singled out amonghis followers, and shot with an arrow by a common foot-soldier.He made light of the wound, but he died of it in a few days,under excommunication. See here the like judgment of God,memorable through all ages!The exaltation jars upon me; not because of the death of themen, for they deserved that, but because it is death eternal, inwhite-hot fire and flame. It makes my flesh crawl. I have notknown more than three men, or perhaps four, in my whole lifetime,whom I would rejoice to see writhing in those fires for even ayear, let alone forever. I believe I would relent before theyear was up, and get them out if I could. I think that inthe long run, if a man's wife and babies, who had not harmed me,should come crying and pleading, I couldn't stand it; I know Ishould forgive him and let him go, even if he had violated amonastery. Henry of Huntington has been watching Godfrey andMarmion for nearly seven hundred and fifty years, now, but Icouldn't do it, I know I couldn't. I am soft and gentle in mynature, and I should have forgiven them seventy-and-seven times,long ago. And I think God has; but this is only an opinion,and not authoritative, like Henry of Huntington's interpretations.I could learn to interpret, but I have never tried; I get solittle time.All through his book Henry exhibits his familiarity with theintentions of God, and with the reasons for his intentions.Sometimes--very often, in fact--the act follows the intentionafter such a wide interval of time that one wonders how Henrycould fit one act out of a hundred to one intention out of ahundred and get the thing right every time when there was suchabundant choice among acts and intentions. Sometimes a manoffends the Deity with a crime, and is punished for it thirtyyears later; meantime he was committed a million other crimes:no matter, Henry can pick out the one that brought the worms.Worms were generally used in those days for the slaying ofparticularly wicked people. This has gone out, now, but in oldtimes it was a favorite. It always indicated a case of "wrath."For instance:. . . the just God avenging Robert Fitzhilderbrand'sperfidy, a worm grew in his vitals, which gradually gnawing itsway through his intestines fattened on the abandoned man till,tortured with excruciating sufferings and venting himself inbitter moans, he was by a fitting punishment brought to his end.--(P. 400.)It was probably an alligator, but we cannot tell; we onlyknow it was a particular breed, and only used to convey wrath.Some authorities think it was an ichthyosaurus, but there ismuch doubt.However, one thing we do know; and that is that that worm had beendue years and years. Robert F. had violated a monastery once;he had committed unprintable crimes since, and they had beenpermitted--under disapproval--but the ravishment of the monasteryhad not been forgotten nor forgiven, and the worm came at last.Why were these reforms put off in this strange way? What was tobe gained by it? Did Henry of Huntington really know his facts,or was he only guessing? Sometimes I am half persuaded thathe is only a guesser, and not a good one. The divine wisdommust surely be of the better quality than he makes it out to be.Five hundred years before Henry's time some forecasts of theLord's purposes were furnished by a pope, who perceived, bycertain perfectly trustworthy signs furnished by the Deity forthe information of His familiars, that the end of the world was. . . about to come. But as this end of the world drawsnear many things are at hand which have not before happened, aschanges in the air, terrible signs in the heavens, tempests outof the common order of the seasons, wars, famines, pestilences,earthquakes in various places; all which will not happen in ourdays, but after our days all will come to pass.Still, the end was so near that these signs were "sent beforethat we may be careful for our souls and be found preparedto meet the impending judgment."That was thirteen hundred years ago. This is really noimprovement on the work of the Roman augurs.
