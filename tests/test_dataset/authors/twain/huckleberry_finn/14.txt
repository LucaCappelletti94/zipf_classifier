I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukesand earls and such, and how gaudy they dressed, andhow much style they put on, and called each otheryour majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, andso on, 'stead of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out,and he was interested. He says:
"I didn' know dey was so many un um. I hain'thearn 'bout none un um, skasely, but ole King Soller-mun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in a pack erk'yards. How much do a king git?"
"Get?" I says; "why, they get a thousand dollarsa month if they want it; they can have just as muchas they want; everything belongs to them."
"AIN' dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?"
"THEY don't do nothing! Why, how you talk!They just set around."
"No; is dat so?"
"Of course it is. They just set around -- except,maybe, when there's a war; then they go to the war.But other times they just lazy around; or go hawking-- just hawking and sp -- Sh! -- d' you hear a noise?"
We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothingbut the flutter of a steamboat's wheel away down,coming around the point; so we come back.
"Yes," says I, "and other times, when things isdull, they fuss with the parlyment; and if everybodydon't go just so he whacks their heads off. Butmostly they hang round the harem."
"Roun' de which?"
"Harem."
"What's de harem?"
"The place where he keeps his wives. Don't youknow about the harem? Solomon had one; he hadabout a million wives."
"Why, yes, dat's so; I -- I'd done forgot it. Aharem's a bo'd'n-house, I reck'n. Mos' likely deyhas rackety times in de nussery. En I reck'n de wivesquarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket. Yit deysay Sollermun de wises' man dat ever live'. I doan'take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise manwant to live in de mids' er sich a blim-blammin' all detime? No -- 'deed he wouldn't. A wise man 'ud takeen buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet DOWN debiler-factry when he want to res'."
"Well, but he WAS the wisest man, anyway; be-cause the widow she told me so, her own self."
"I doan k'yer what de widder say, he WARN'T nowise man nuther. He had some er de dad-fetchedes'ways I ever see. Does you know 'bout dat chile dathe 'uz gwyne to chop in two?"
"Yes, the widow told me all about it."
"WELL, den! Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in deworl'? You jes' take en look at it a minute. Dah'sde stump, dah -- dat's one er de women; heah's you-- dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yerdollar bill's de chile. Bofe un you claims it. Whatdoes I do? Does I shin aroun' mongs' de neighborsen fine out which un you de bill DO b'long to, en han'it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way datanybody dat had any gumption would? No; I takeen whack de bill in TWO, en give half un it to you, ende yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat's de waySollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now Iwant to ast you: what's de use er dat half a bill? --can't buy noth'n wid it. En what use is a half achile? I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um."
"But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point --blame it, you've missed it a thousand mile."
"Who? Me? Go 'long. Doan' talk to me 'boutyo' pints. I reck'n I knows sense when I sees it; endey ain' no sense in sich doin's as dat. De 'sputewarn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout awhole chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan'know enough to come in out'n de rain. Doan' talkto me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back."
"But I tell you you don't get the point."
"Blame de point! I reck'n I knows what I knows.En mine you, de REAL pint is down furder -- it's downdeeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was raised.You take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen; isdat man gwyne to be waseful o' chillen? No, heain't; he can't 'ford it. HE know how to value 'em.But you take a man dat's got 'bout five million chillenrunnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt. HE as soonchop a chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'. Achile er two, mo' er less, warn't no consekens toSollermun, dad fatch him!"
I never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in hishead once, there warn't no getting it out again. Hewas the most down on Solomon of any nigger I eversee. So I went to talking about other kings, and letSolomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that gothis head cut off in France long time ago; and abouthis little boy the dolphin, that would a been a king,but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say hedied there.
"Po' little chap."
"But some says he got out and got away, and cometo America."
"Dat's good! But he'll be pooty lonesome -- deyain' no kings here, is dey, Huck?"
"No."
"Den he cain't git no situation. What he gwyneto do?"
"Well, I don't know. Some of them gets on thepolice, and some of them learns people how to talkFrench."
"Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de sameway we does?"
"NO, Jim; you couldn't understand a word theysaid -- not a single word."
"Well, now, I be ding-busted! How do datcome?"
"I don't know; but it's so. I got some of theirjabber out of a book. S'pose a man was to come toyou and say Polly-voo-franzy -- what would youthink?"
"I wouldn' think nuff'n; I'd take en bust him overde head -- dat is, if he warn't white. I wouldn't 'lowno nigger to call me dat."
"Shucks, it ain't calling you anything. It's onlysaying, do you know how to talk French?"
"Well, den, why couldn't he SAY it?"
"Why, he IS a-saying it. That's a Frenchman'sWAY of saying it."
"Well, it's a blame ridicklous way, en I doan' wantto hear no mo' 'bout it. Dey ain' no sense in it."
"Looky here, Jim; does a cat talk like we do?"
"No, a cat don't."
"Well, does a cow?"
"No, a cow don't, nuther."
"Does a cat talk like a cow, or a cow talk like acat?"
"No, dey don't."
"It's natural and right for 'em to talk different fromeach other, ain't it?"
"Course."
"And ain't it natural and right for a cat and a cowto talk different from US?"
"Why, mos' sholy it is."
"Well, then, why ain't it natural and right for aFRENCHMAN to talk different from us? You answer methat."
"Is a cat a man, Huck?"
"No."
"Well, den, dey ain't no sense in a cat talkin' like aman. Is a cow a man? -- er is a cow a cat?"
"No, she ain't either of them."
"Well, den, she ain't got no business to talk likeeither one er the yuther of 'em. Is a Frenchman aman?"
"Yes."
"WELL, den! Dad blame it, why doan' he TALK likea man? You answer me DAT!"
I see it warn't no use wasting words -- you can'tlearn a nigger to argue. So I quit.
