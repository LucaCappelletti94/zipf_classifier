"This is a surprise to me which I wasn't lookingfor; and I'll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain'tvery well fixed to meet it and answer it; for mybrother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke hisarm, and our baggage got put off at a town above herelast night in the night by a mistake. I am PeterWilks' brother Harvey, and this is his brother William,which can't hear nor speak -- and can't even makesigns to amount to much, now't he's only got onehand to work them with. We are who we say we are;and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I canprove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more,but go to the hotel and wait."
So him and the new dummy started off; and the kinghe laughs, and blethers out:
"Broke his arm -- VERY likely, AIN'T it? -- and veryconvenient, too, for a fraud that's got to make signs,and ain't learnt how. Lost their baggage! That'sMIGHTY good! -- and mighty ingenious -- under theCIRCUMSTANCES!
So he laughed again; and so did everybody else,except three or four, or maybe half a dozen. One ofthese was that doctor; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had justcome off of the steamboat and was talking to him in alow voice, and glancing towards the king now and thenand nodding their heads -- it was Levi Bell, the lawyerthat was gone up to Louisville; and another one wasa big rough husky that come along and listened toall the old gentleman said, and was listening to theking now. And when the king got done this huskyup and says:
"Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'dyou come to this town?"
"The day before the funeral, friend," says the king.
"But what time o' day?"
"In the evenin' -- 'bout an hour er two before sun-down."
"HOW'D you come?"
"I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincin-nati."
"Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pintin the MORNIN' -- in a canoe?"
"I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'."
"It's a lie."
Several of them jumped for him and begged him notto talk that way to an old man and a preacher.
"Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. Hewas up at the Pint that mornin'. I live up there, don'tI? Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I seehim there. He come in a canoe, along with TimCollins and a boy."
The doctor he up and says:
"Would you know the boy again if you was to seehim, Hines?"
"I reckon I would, but I don't know. Why,yonder he is, now. I know him perfectly easy."
It was me he pointed at. The doctor says:
"Neighbors, I don't know whether the new coupleis frauds or not; but if THESE two ain't frauds, I am anidiot, that's all. I think it's our duty to see that theydon't get away from here till we've looked into thisthing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest ofyou. We'll take these fellows to the tavern andaffront them with t'other couple, and I reckon we'llfind out SOMETHING before we get through."
It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not forthe king's friends; so we all started. It was aboutsundown. The doctor he led me along by the hand,and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go myhand.
We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit upsome candles, and fetched in the new couple. First,the doctor says:
"I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, butI think they're frauds, and they may have complicesthat we don't know nothing about. If they have,won't the complices get away with that bag of goldPeter Wilks left? It ain't unlikely. If these menain't frauds, they won't object to sending for thatmoney and letting us keep it till they prove they'reall right -- ain't that so?"
Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they hadour gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart.But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says:
"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for Iain't got no disposition to throw anything in the wayof a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o' thismisable business; but, alas, the money ain't there;you k'n send and see, if you want to."
"Where is it, then?"
"Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for herI took and hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed,not wishin' to bank it for the few days we'd be here,and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein' usedto niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants inEngland. The niggers stole it the very next mornin'after I had went down stairs; and when I sold 'em Ihadn't missed the money yit, so they got clean awaywith it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentle-men."
The doctor and several said "Shucks!" and I seenobody didn't altogether believe him. One man askedme if I see the niggers steal it. I said no, but I seethem sneaking out of the room and hustling away, andI never thought nothing, only I reckoned they wasafraid they had waked up my master and was trying toget away before he made trouble with them. Thatwas all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on meand says:
"Are YOU English, too?"
I says yes; and him and some others laughed, andsaid, "Stuff!"
Well, then they sailed in on the general investiga-tion, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hourout, and nobody never said a word about supper, norever seemed to think about it -- and so they kept itup, and kept it up; and it WAS the worst mixed-upthing you ever see. They made the king tell his yarn,and they made the old gentleman tell his'n; and any-body but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEENthat the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'otherone lies. And by and by they had me up to tell whatI knowed. The king he give me a left-handed lookout of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enoughto talk on the right side. I begun to tell aboutSheffield, and how we lived there, and all about theEnglish Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get prettyfur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, thelawyer, says:
"Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if Iwas you. I reckon you ain't used to lying, it don'tseem to come handy; what you want is practice. Youdo it pretty awkward."
I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I wasglad to be let off, anyway.
The doctor he started to say something, and turnsand says:
"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell --"The king broke in and reached out his hand, andsays:
"Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friendthat he's wrote so often about?"
The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyersmiled and looked pleased, and they talked right alongawhile, and then got to one side and talked low; andat last the lawyer speaks up and says:
"That 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it,along with your brother's, and then they'll know it'sall right."
So they got some paper and a pen, and the king heset down and twisted his head to one side, and chawedhis tongue, and scrawled off something; and then theygive the pen to the duke -- and then for the first timethe duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote.So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman andsays:
"You and your brother please write a line or twoand sign your names."
The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't readit. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says:
"Well, it beats ME -- and snaked a lot of old lettersout of his pocket, and examined them, and then ex-amined the old man's writing, and then THEM again;and then says: "These old letters is from HarveyWilks; and here's THESE two handwritings, and any-body can see they didn't write them" (the king andthe duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to seehow the lawyer had took them in), "and here's THIS oldgentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easyenough, HE didn't write them -- fact is, the scratcheshe makes ain't properly WRITING at all. Now, here'ssome letters from --"
The new old gentleman says:
"If you please, let me explain. Nobody can readmy hand but my brother there -- so he copies for me.It's HIS hand you've got there, not mine."
"WELL!" says the lawyer, "this IS a state ofthings. I've got some of William's letters, too; so ifyou'll get him to write a line or so we can com --"
"He CAN'T write with his left hand," says the oldgentleman. "If he could use his right hand, youwould see that he wrote his own letters and minetoo. Look at both, please -- they're by the samehand."
The lawyer done it, and says:
"I believe it's so -- and if it ain't so, there's a heapstronger resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the trackof a slution, but it's gone to grass, partly. But any-way, one thing is proved -- THESE two ain't either of'em Wilkses" -- and he wagged his head towards theking and the duke.
Well, what do you think? That muleheaded oldfool wouldn't give in THEN! Indeed he wouldn't.Said it warn't no fair test. Said his brother Williamwas the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't triedto write -- HE see William was going to play one of hisjokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so hewarmed up and went warbling right along till he wasactuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIM-SELF; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, andsays:
"I've thought of something. Is there anybodyhere that helped to lay out my br -- helped to lay outthe late Peter Wilks for burying?"
"Yes," says somebody, "me and Ab Turner doneit. We're both here."
Then the old man turns towards the king, andsays:
"Peraps this gentleman can tell me what wastattooed on his breast?"
Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mightyquick, or he'd a squshed down like a bluff bank thatthe river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and,mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to makemost ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one asthat without any notice, because how was HE going toknow what was tattooed on the man? He whitened alittle; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still inthere, and everybody bending a little forwards andgazing at him. Says I to myself, NOW he'll throw upthe sponge -- there ain't no more use. Well, did he?A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. Ireckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tiredthem people out, so they'd thin out, and him and theduke could break loose and get away. Anyway, heset there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:
"Mf! It's a VERY tough question, AIN'T it! YES,sir, I k'n tell you what's tattooed on his breast. It'sjest a small, thin, blue arrow -- that's what it is; andif you don't look clost, you can't see it. NOW whatdo you say -- hey?"
Well, I never see anything like that old blister forclean out-and-out cheek.
The new old gentleman turns brisk towards AbTurner and his pard, and his eye lights up like hejudged he'd got the king THIS time, and says:
"There -- you've heard what he said! Was thereany such mark on Peter Wilks' breast?"
Both of them spoke up and says:
"We didn't see no such mark."
"Good!" says the old gentleman. "Now, whatyou DID see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B(which is an initial he dropped when he was young),and a W, with dashes between them, so: P -- B --W" -- and he marked them that way on a piece ofpaper. "Come, ain't that what you saw?"
Both of them spoke up again, and says:
"No, we DIDN'T. We never seen any marks at all."
Well, everybody WAS in a state of mind now, andthey sings out:
"The whole BILIN' of 'm 's frauds! Le's duck'em! le's drown 'em! le's ride 'em on a rail!" andeverybody was whooping at once, and there was a rat-tling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the tableand yells, and says:
"Gentlemen -- gentleMEN! Hear me just a word --just a SINGLE word -- if you PLEASE! There's one wayyet -- let's go and dig up the corpse and look."
That took them.
"Hooray!" they all shouted, and was starting rightoff; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out:
"Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men andthe boy, and fetch THEM along, too!"
"We'll do it!" they all shouted; "and if we don'tfind them marks we'll lynch the whole gang!"
I WAS scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't nogetting away, you know. They gripped us all, andmarched us right along, straight for the graveyard,which was a mile and a half down the river, and thewhole town at our heels, for we made noise enough,and it was only nine in the evening.
As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sentMary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip herthe wink she'd light out and save me, and blow on ourdead-beats.
Well, we swarmed along down the river road, justcarrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scarythe sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning towink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst theleaves. This was the most awful trouble and mostdangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned;everything was going so different from what I hadallowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take myown time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and haveMary Jane at my back to save me and set me freewhen the close-fit come, here was nothing in theworld betwixt me and sudden death but just themtattoo-marks. If they didn't find them --
I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, some-how, I couldn't think about nothing else. It gotdarker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to givethe crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by thewrist -- Hines -- and a body might as well try to giveGoliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was soexcited, and I had to run to keep up.
When they got there they swarmed into the grave-yard and washed over it like an overflow. And whenthey got to the grave they found they had about ahundred times as many shovels as they wanted, butnobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern. But theysailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the light-ning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half amile off, to borrow one.
So they dug and dug like everything; and it gotawful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swishedand swushed along, and the lightning come brisker andbrisker, and the thunder boomed; but them peoplenever took no notice of it, they was so full of thisbusiness; and one minute you could see everythingand every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls ofdirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next secondthe dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothingat all.
At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrewthe lid, and then such another crowding and shoulder-ing and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get asight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it wasawful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling andtugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in theworld, he was so excited and panting.
All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluiceof white glare, and somebody sings out:
"By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on hisbreast!"
Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, anddropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his wayin and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinnedfor the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.
I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew --leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark,and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of therain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splittingof the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip italong!
When I struck the town I see there warn't nobodyout in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets,but humped it straight through the main one; andwhen I begun to get towards our house I aimed myeye and set it. No light there; the house all dark --which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn'tknow why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, FLASHcomes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heartswelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same secondthe house and all was behind me in the dark, andwasn't ever going to be before me no more in thisworld. She WAS the best girl I ever see, and had themost sand.
The minute I was far enough above the town to seeI could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp fora boat to borrow, and the first time the lightningshowed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it andshoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened withnothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling bigdistance off, away out there in the middle of the river,but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raftat last I was so fagged I would a just laid down toblow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn't.As I sprung aboard I sung out:
"Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory beto goodness, we're shut of them!"
Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both armsspread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsedhim in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouthand I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he wasold King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and itmost scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jimfished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me,and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shutof the king and the duke, but I says:
"Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for break-fast! Cut loose and let her slide!"
So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down theriver, and it DID seem so good to be free again and allby ourselves on the big river, and nobody to botherus. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up andcrack my heels a few times -- I couldn't help it; butabout the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowedmighty well, and held my breath and listened andwaited; and sure enough, when the next flash bustedout over the water, here they come! -- and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum! Itwas the king and the duke.
So I wilted right down on to the planks then, andgive up; and it was all I could do to keep from crying.
