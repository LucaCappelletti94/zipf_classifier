SCENE
Drawing-room at Hunstanton, after dinner, lamps lit. Door L.C.Door R.C.
[Ladies seated on sofas.]
MRS. ALLONBY. What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men fora little!
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don't they?
MRS. ALLONBY. Persecute us? I wish they did.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear!
MRS. ALLONBY. The annoying thing is that the wretches can beperfectly happy without us. That is why I think it is everywoman's duty never to leave them alone for a single moment, exceptduring this short breathing space after dinner; without which Ibelieve we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows.
[Enter Servants with coffee.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Worn to shadows, dear?
MRS. ALLONBY. Yes, Lady Hunstanton. It is such a strain keepingmen up to the mark. They are always trying to escape from us.
LADY STUTFIELD. It seems to me that it is we who are always tryingto escape from them. Men are so very, very heartless. They knowtheir power and use it.
LADY CAROLINE. [Takes coffee from Servant.] What stuff andnonsense all this about men is! The thing to do is to keep men intheir proper place.
MRS. ALLONBY. But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?
LADY CAROLINE. Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.
MRS. ALLONBY. [Takes coffee from Servant.] Really? And ifthey're not married?
LADY CAROLINE. If they are not married, they should be lookingafter a wife. It's perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelorswho are going about society. There should be a law passed tocompel them all to marry within twelve months.
LADY STUTFIELD. [Refuses coffee.] But if they're in love withsome one who, perhaps, is tied to another?
LADY CAROLINE. In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should bemarried off in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order toteach them not to meddle with other people's property.
MRS. ALLONBY. I don't think that we should ever be spoken of asother people's property. All men are married women's property.That is the only true definition of what married women's propertyreally is. But we don't belong to any one.
LADY STUTFIELD. Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.
LADY HUNSTANTON. But do you really think, dear Caroline, thatlegislation would improve matters in any way? I am told that,nowadays, all the married men live like bachelors, and all thebachelors like married men.
MRS. ALLONBY. I certainly never know one from the other.
LADY STUTFIELD. Oh, I think one can always know at once whether aman has home claims upon his life or not. I have noticed a very,very sad expression in the eyes of so many married men.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, all that I have noticed is that they arehorribly tedious when they are good husbands, and abominablyconceited when they are not.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, I suppose the type of husband hascompletely changed since my young days, but I'm bound to state thatpoor dear Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and asgood as gold.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I'mtired of meeting him.
LADY CAROLINE. But you renew him from time to time, don't you?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh no, Lady Caroline. I have only had one husbandas yet. I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.
LADY CAROLINE. With your views on life I wonder you married atall.
MRS. ALLONBY. So do I.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear child, I believe you are really veryhappy in your married life, but that you like to hide yourhappiness from others.
MRS. ALLONBY. I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Oh, I hope not, dear. I knew his mother quitewell. She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland'sdaughters
LADY CAROLINE. Victoria Stratton? I remember her perfectly. Asilly fair-haired woman with no chin.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, Ernest has a chin. He has a very strong chin, asquare chin. Ernest's chin is far too square.
LADY STUTFIELD. But do you really think a man's chin can be toosquare? I think a man should look very, very strong, and that hischin should be quite, quite square.
MRS. ALLONBY. Then you should certainly know Ernest, LadyStutfield. It is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got noconversation at all.
LADY STUTFIELD. I adore silent men.
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, Ernest isn't silent. He talks the whole time.But he has got no conversation. What he talks about I don't know.I haven't listened to him for years.
LADY STUTFIELD. Have you never forgiven him then? How sad thatseems! But all life is very, very sad, is it not?
MRS. ALLONBY. Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a MAUVAIS QUARTD'HEURE made up of exquisite moments.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, there are moments, certainly. But was itsomething very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did? Did he becomeangry with you, and say anything that was unkind or true?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh dear, no. Ernest is invariably calm. That isone of the reasons he always gets on my nerves. Nothing is soaggravating as calmness. There is something positively brutalabout the good temper of most modern men. I wonder we women standit as well as we do.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; men's good temper shows they are not sosensitive as we are, not so finely strung. It makes a greatbarrier often between husband and wife, does it not? But I wouldso much like to know what was the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.
MRS. ALLONBY. Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise totell everybody else.
LADY STUTFIELD. Thank you, thank you. I will make a point ofrepeating it.
MRS. ALLONBY. When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to mepositively on his knees that he had never loved any one before inthe whole course of his life. I was very young at the time, so Ididn't believe him, I needn't tell you. Unfortunately, however, Imade no enquiries of any kind till after I had been actuallymarried four or five months. I found out then that what he hadtold me was perfectly true. And that sort of thing makes a man soabsolutely uninteresting.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear!
MRS. ALLONBY. Men always want to be a woman's first love. That istheir clumsy vanity. We women have a more subtle instinct aboutthings. What we like is to be a man's last romance.
LADY STUTFIELD. I see what you mean. It's very, very beautiful.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear child, you don't mean to tell me that youwon't forgive your husband because he never loved any one else?Did you ever hear such a thing, Caroline? I am quite surprised.
LADY CAROLINE. Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane,that nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.They apparently are getting remarkably rare.
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, they're quite out of date.
LADY STUTFIELD. Except amongst the middle classes, I have beentold.
MRS. ALLONBY. How like the middle classes!
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes - is it not? - very, very like them.
LADY CAROLINE. If what you tell us about the middle classes istrue, Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit. It ismuch to be regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be sopersistently frivolous, under the impression apparently that it isthe proper thing to be. It is to that I attribute the unhappinessof so many marriages we all know of in society.
MRS. ALLONBY. Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don't think thefrivolity of the wife has ever anything to do with it. Moremarriages are ruined nowadays by the common sense of the husbandthan by anything else. How can a woman be expected to be happywith a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectlyrational being?
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear!
MRS. ALLONBY. Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongsto a sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.He can't help himself. It is in his race. The History of Woman isvery different. We have always been picturesque protests againstthe mere existence of common sense. We saw its dangers from thefirst.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainlymost, most trying. Do tell me your conception of the IdealHusband. I think it would be so very, very helpful.
MRS. ALLONBY. The Ideal Husband? There couldn't be such a thing.The institution is wrong.
LADY STUTFIELD. The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to US.
LADY CAROLINE. He would probably be extremely realistic.
MRS. CAROLINE. The Ideal Man! Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to usas if we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children. Heshould refuse all our serious requests, and gratify every one ofour whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, and forbid usto have missions. He should always say much more than he means,and always mean much more than he says.
LADY HUNSTANTON. But how could he do both, dear?
MRS. ALLONBY. He should never run down other pretty women. Thatwould show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had toomuch. No; he should be nice about them all, but say that somehowthey don't attract him.
LADY STUTFIELD. Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hearabout other women.
MRS. ALLONBY. If we ask him a question about anything, he shouldgive us an answer all about ourselves. He should invariably praiseus for whatever qualities he knows we haven't got. But he shouldbe pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues thatwe have never dreamed of possessing. He should never believe thatwe know the use of useful things. That would be unforgiveable.But he should shower on us everything we don't want.
LADY CAROLINE. As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but paybills and compliments.
MRS. ALLONBY. He should persistently compromise us in public, andtreat us with absolute respect when we are alone. And yet heshould be always ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, wheneverwe want one, and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at amoment's notice, and to overwhelm us with just reproaches in lessthan twenty minutes, and to be positively violent at the end ofhalf an hour, and to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight, whenwe have to go and dress for dinner. And when, after that, one hasseen him for really the last time, and he has refused to take backthe little things he has given one, and promised never tocommunicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, heshould be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all daylong, and send one little notes every half-hour by a privatehansom, and dine quite alone at the club, so that every one shouldknow how unhappy he was. And after a whole dreadful week, duringwhich one has gone about everywhere with one's husband, just toshow how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a third lastparting, in the evening, and then, if his conduct has been quiteirreproachable, and one has behaved really badly to him, he shouldbe allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the wrong, andwhen he has admitted that, it becomes a woman's duty to forgive,and one can do it all over again from the beginning, withvariations.
LADY HUNSTANTON. How clever you are, my dear! You never mean asingle word you say.
LADY STUTFIELD. Thank you, thank you. It has been quite, quiteentrancing. I must try and remember it all. There are such anumber of details that are so very, very important.
LADY CAROLINE. But you have not told us yet what the reward of theIdeal Man is to be.
MRS. ALLONBY. His reward? Oh, infinite expectation. That isquite enough for him.
LADY STUTFIELD. But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, arethey not?
MRS. ALLONBY. That makes no matter. One should never surrender.
LADY STUTFIELD. Not even to the Ideal Man?
MRS. ALLONBY. Certainly not to him. Unless, of course, one wantsto grow tired of him.
LADY STUTFIELD. Oh! . . . yes. I see that. It is very, veryhelpful. Do you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the IdealMan? Or are there more than one?
MRS. ALLONBY. There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Oh, my dear!
MRS. ALLONBY. [Going over to her.] What has happened? Do tellme.
LADY HUNSTANTON [in a low voice] I had completely forgotten thatthe American young lady has been in the room all the time. I amafraid some of this clever talk may have shocked her a little.
MRS. ALLONBY. Ah, that will do her so much good!
LADY HUNSTANTON. Let us hope she didn't understand much. I thinkI had better go over and talk to her. [Rises and goes across toHESTER WORSLEY.] Well, dear Miss Worsley. [Sitting down besideher.] How quiet you have been in your nice little corner all thistime! I suppose you have been reading a book? There are so manybooks here in the library.
HESTER. No, I have been listening to the conversation.
LADY HUNSTANTON. You mustn't believe everything that was said, youknow, dear.
HESTER. I didn't believe any of it
LADY HUNSTANTON. That is quite right, dear.
HESTER. [Continuing.] I couldn't believe that any women couldreally hold such views of life as I have heard to-night from someof your guests. [An awkward pause.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. I hear you have such pleasant society in America.Quite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.
HESTER. There are cliques in America as elsewhere, LadyHunstanton. But true American society consists simply of all thegood women and good men we have in our country.
LADY HUNSTANTON. What a sensible system, and I dare say quitepleasant too. I am afraid in England we have too many artificialsocial barriers. We don't see as much as we should of the middleand lower classes.
HESTER. In America we have no lower classes.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Really? What a very strange arrangement!
MRS. ALLONBY. What is that dreadful girl talking about?
LADY STUTFIELD. She is painfully natural, is she not?
LADY CAROLINE. There are a great many things you haven't got inAmerica, I am told, Miss Worsley. They say you have no ruins, andno curiosities.
MRS. ALLONBY. [To LADY STUTFIELD.] What nonsense! They havetheir mothers and their manners.
HESTER. The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities,Lady Caroline. They are sent over to us every summer, regularly,in the steamers, and propose to us the day after they land. As forruins, we are trying to build up something that will last longerthan brick or stone. [Gets up to take her fan from table.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. What is that, dear? Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition,is it not, at that place that has the curious name?
HESTER. [Standing by table.] We are trying to build up life, LadyHunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests onhere. This sounds strange to you all, no doubt. How could itsound other than strange? You rich people in England, you don'tknow how you are living. How could you know? You shut out fromyour society the gentle and the good. You laugh at the simple andthe pure. Living, as you all do, on others and by them, you sneerat self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread to the poor, it is merelyto keep them quiet for a season. With all your pomp and wealth andart you don't know how to live - you don't even know that. Youlove the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the beautythat you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty oflife, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing. Youhave lost life's secret. Oh, your English society seems to meshallow, selfish, foolish. It has blinded its eyes, and stoppedits ears. It lies like a leper in purple. It sits like a deadthing smeared with gold. It is all wrong, all wrong.
LADY STUTFIELD. I don't think one should know of these things. Itis not very, very nice, is it?
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked Englishsociety so much. You were such a success in it. And you were somuch admired by the best people. I quite forget what Lord HenryWeston said of you - but it was most complimentary, and you knowwhat an authority he is on beauty.
HESTER. Lord Henry Weston! I remember him, Lady Hunstanton. Aman with a hideous smile and a hideous past. He is askedeverywhere. No dinner-party is complete without him. What ofthose whose ruin is due to him? They are outcasts. They arenameless. If you met them in the street you would turn your headaway. I don't complain of their punishment. Let all women whohave sinned be punished.
[MRS. ARBUTHNOT enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a laceveil over her head. She hears the last words and starts.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear young lady!
HESTER. It is right that they should be punished, but don't letthem be the only ones to suffer. If a man and woman have sinned,let them both go forth into the desert to love or loathe each otherthere. Let them both be branded. Set a mark, if you wish, oneach, but don't punish the one and let the other go free. Don'thave one law for men and another for women. You are unjust towomen in England. And till you count what is a shame in a woman tobe an infamy in a man, you will always be unjust, and Right, thatpillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud, will be made dimto your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not regarded
LADY CAROLINE. Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up,ask you for my cotton that is just behind you? Thank you.
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot! I am so pleased you havecome up. But I didn't hear you announced.
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, LadyHunstanton, just as I was. You didn't tell me you had a party.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Not a party. Only a few guests who are stayingin the house, and whom you must know. Allow me. [Tries to helpher. Rings bell.] Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of mysweetest friends. Lady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs.Allonby, and my young American friend, Miss Worsley, who has justbeen telling us all how wicked we are.
HESTER. I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, LadyHunstanton. But there are some things in England -
LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear young lady, there was a great deal oftruth, I dare say, in what you said, and you looked very prettywhile you said it, which is much more important, Lord Illingworthwould tell us. The only point where I thought you were a littlehard was about Lady Caroline's brother, about poor Lord Henry. Heis really such good company.
[Enter Footman.]
Take Mrs. Arbuthnot's things.
[Exit Footman with wraps.]
HESTER. Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother. I amsorry for the pain I must have caused you - I -
LADY CAROLINE. My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your littlespeech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, wasthe part about my brother. Nothing that you could possibly saycould be too bad for him. I regard Henry as infamous, absolutelyinfamous. But I am bound to state, as you were remarking, Jane,that he is excellent company, and he has one of the best cooks inLondon, and after a good dinner one can forgive anybody, even one'sown relations.
LADY HUNSTANTON [to MISS WORSLEY] Now, do come, dear, and makefriends with Mrs. Arbuthnot. She is one of the good, sweet, simplepeople you told us we never admitted into society. I am sorry tosay Mrs. Arbuthnot comes very rarely to me. But that is not myfault.
MRS. ALLONBY. What a bore it is the men staying so long afterdinner! I expect they are saying the most dreadful things aboutus.
LADY STUTFIELD. Do you really think so?
MRS. ALLONBY. I was sure of it.
LADY STUTFIELD. How very, very horrid of them! Shall we go ontothe terrace?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and thedowdies. [Rises and goes with LADY STUTFIELD to door L.C.] We areonly going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.
LADY HUNSTANTON. You will find a great many, dear, a great many.But don't catch cold. [To MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] We shall all missGerald so much, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. But has Lord Illingworth really offered to makeGerald his secretary?
LADY HUNSTANTON. Oh, yes! He has been most charming about it. Hehas the highest possible opinion of your boy. You don't know LordIllingworth, I believe, dear.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I have never met him.
LADY HUNSTANTON. You know him by name, no doubt?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I am afraid I don't. I live so much out of theworld, and see so few people. I remember hearing years ago of anold Lord Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, yes. That would be the last Earl but one.He was a very curious man. He wanted to marry beneath him. Orwouldn't, I believe. There was some scandal about it. The presentLord Illingworth is quite different. He is very distinguished. Hedoes - well, he does nothing, which I am afraid our pretty Americanvisitor here thinks very wrong of anybody, and I don't know that hecares much for the subjects in which you are so interested, dearMrs. Arbuthnot. Do you think, Caroline, that Lord Illingworth isinterested in the Housing of the Poor?
LADY CAROLINE. I should fancy not at all, Jane.
LADY HUNSTANTON. We all have our different tastes, have we not?But Lord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothinghe couldn't get if he chose to ask for it. Of course, he iscomparatively a young man still, and he has only come to his titlewithin - how long exactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworthsucceeded?
LADY CAROLINE. About four years, I think, Jane. I know it was thesame year in which my brother had his last exposure in the eveningnewspapers.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, I remember. That would be about four yearsago. Of course, there were a great many people between the presentLord Illingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot. There was - whowas there, Caroline?
LADY CAROLINE. There was poor Margaret's baby. You remember howanxious she was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, andher husband died shortly afterwards, and she married almostimmediately one of Lord Ascot's sons, who, I am told, beats her.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in thefamily. And there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted tobe a lunatic, or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forgetwhich, but I know the Court of Chancery investigated the matter,and decided that he was quite sane. And I saw him afterwards atpoor Lord Plumstead's with straws in his hair, or something veryodd about him. I can't recall what. I often regret, LadyCaroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son get thetitle.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Lady Cecilia?
LADY HUNSTANTON. Lord Illingworth's mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,was one of the Duchess of Jerningham's pretty daughters, and shemarried Sir Thomas Harford, who wasn't considered a very good matchfor her at the time, though he was said to be the handsomest man inLondon. I knew them all quite intimately, and both the sons,Arthur and George.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course,Lady Hunstanton?
LADY HUNSTANTON. No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field. Orwas it fishing, Caroline? I forget. But George came in foreverything. I always tell him that no younger son has ever hadsuch good luck as he has had.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald atonce. Might I see him? Can he be sent for?
LADY HUNSTANTON. Certainly, dear. I will send one of the servantsinto the dining-room to fetch him. I don't know what keeps thegentlemen so long. [Rings bell.] When I knew Lord Illingworthfirst as plain George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant youngman about town, with not a penny of money except what poor dearLady Cecilia gave him. She was quite devoted to him. Chiefly, Ifancy, because he was on bad terms with his father. Oh, here isthe dear Archdeacon. [To Servant.] It doesn't matter.
[Enter SIR JOHN and DOCTOR DAUBENY. SIR JOHN goes over to LADYSTUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY to LADY HUNSTANTON.]
THE ARCHDEACON. Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining. Ihave never enjoyed myself more. [Sees MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] Ah, Mrs.Arbuthnot.
LADY HUNSTANTON. [To DOCTOR DAUBENY.] You see I have got Mrs.Arbuthnot to come to me at last.
THE ARCHDEACON. That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton. Mrs.Daubeny will be quite jealous of you.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not comewith you to-night. Headache as usual, I suppose.
THE ARCHDEACON. Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr. But sheis happiest alone. She is happiest alone.
LADY CAROLINE. [To her husband.] John! [SIR JOHN goes over tohis wife. DOCTOR DAUBENY talks to LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS.ARBUTHNOT.]
[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time. He haspassed across the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS.ALLONBY, who with LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking onto the terrace.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH. How is the most charming woman in the world?
MRS. ALLONBY. [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.] We are bothquite well, thank you, Lord Illingworth. But what a short time youhave been in the dining-room! It seems as if we had only justleft.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I was bored to death. Never opened my lips thewhole time. Absolutely longing to come in to you.
MRS. ALLONBY. You should have. The American girl has been givingus a lecture.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Really? All Americans lecture, I believe. Isuppose it is something in their climate. What did she lectureabout?
MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, Puritanism, of course.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I am going to convert her, am I not? How longdo you give me?
MRS. ALLONBY. A week.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. A week is more than enough.
[Enter GERALD and LORD ALFRED.]
GERALD. [Going to MRS. ARBUTHNOT.] Dear mother!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald, I don't feel at all well. See me home,Gerald. I shouldn't have come.
GERALD. I am so sorry, mother. Certainly. But you must know LordIllingworth first. [Goes across room.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Not to-night, Gerald.
GERALD. Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. With the greatest pleasure. [To MRS. ALLONBY.]I'll be back in a moment. People's mothers always bore me todeath. All women become like their mothers. That is theirtragedy.
MRS. ALLONBY. No man does. That is his.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What a delightful mood you are in to-night![Turns round and goes across with GERALD to MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Whenhe sees her, he starts back in wonder. Then slowly his eyes turntowards GERALD.]
GERALD. Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to takeme as his private secretary. [MRS. ARBUTHNOT bows coldly.] It isa wonderful opening for me, isn't it? I hope he won't bedisappointed in me, that is all. You'll thank Lord Illingworth,mother, won't you?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, tointerest himself in you for the moment.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. [Putting his hand on GERALD's shoulder.] Oh,Gerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. There can be nothing in common between you and myson, Lord Illingworth.
GERALD. Dear mother, how can you say so? Of course LordIllingworth is awfully clever and that sort of thing. There isnothing Lord Illingworth doesn't know.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear boy!
GERALD. He knows more about life than any one I have ever met. Ifeel an awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth. Ofcourse, I have had so few advantages. I have not been to Eton orOxford like other chaps. But Lord Illingworth doesn't seem to mindthat. He has been awfully good to me, mother.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Lord Illingworth may change his mind. He may notreally want you as his secretary.
GERALD. Mother!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You must remember, as you said yourself, you havehad so few advantages.
MRS. ALLONBY. Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for amoment. Do come over.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot? Now, don'tlet your charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald. Thething is quite settled, isn't it?
GERALD. I hope so. [LORD ILLINGWORTH goes across to MRS.ARBUTHNOT.]
MRS. ALLONBY. I thought you were never going to leave the lady inblack velvet.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. She is excessively handsome. [Looks at MRS.ARBUTHNOT.]
LADY HUNSTANTON. Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room? Miss Worsley is going to play. You'll come too, dear Mrs.Arbuthnot, won't you? You don't know what a treat is in store foryou. [To DOCTOR DAUBENY.] I must really take Miss Worsley downsome afternoon to the rectory. I should so much like dear Mrs.Daubeny to hear her on the violin. Ah, I forgot. Dear Mrs.Daubeny's hearing is a little defective, is it not?
THE ARCHDEACON. Her deafness is a great privation to her. Shecan't even hear my sermons now. She reads them at home. But shehas many resources in herself, many resources.
LADY HUNSTANTON. She reads a good deal, I suppose?
THE ARCHDEACON. Just the very largest print. The eyesight israpidly going. But she's never morbid, never morbid.
GERALD. [To LORD ILLINGWORTH.] Do speak to my mother, LordIllingworth, before you go into the music-room. She seems tothink, somehow, you don't mean what you said to me.
MRS. ALLONBY. Aren't you coming?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. In a few moments. Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs.Arbuthnot would allow me, I would like to say a few words to her,and we will join you later on.
LADY HUNSTANTON. Ah, of course. You will have a great deal to sayto her, and she will have a great deal to thank you for. It is notevery son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot. But I know youappreciate that, dear.
LADY CAROLINE. John!
LADY HUNSTANTON. Now, don't keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, LordIllingworth. We can't spare her.
[Exit following the other guests. Sound of violin heard frommusic-room.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH. So that is our son, Rachel! Well, I am veryproud of him. He in a Harford, every inch of him. By the way, whyArbuthnot, Rachel?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. One name is as good as another, when one has noright to any name.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I suppose so - but why Gerald?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. After a man whose heart I broke - after my father.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Well, Rachel, what in over is over. All I havegot to say now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.The world will know him merely as my private secretary, but to mehe will be something very near, and very dear. It is a curiousthing, Rachel; my life seemed to be quite complete. It was not so.It lacked something, it lacked a son. I have found my son now, Iam glad I have found him.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. You have no right to claim him, or the smallestpart of him. The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself forover twenty years. Why not let me have him for a little now? Heis quite as much mine as yours.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Are you talking of the child you abandoned? Ofthe child who, as far as you are concerned, might have died ofhunger and of want?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me. Itwas not I who left you.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I left you because you refused to give the child aname. Before my son was born, I implored you to marry me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I had no expectations then. And besides,Rachel, I wasn't much older than you were. I was only twenty-two.I was twenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in yourfather's garden.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. When a man is old enough to do wrong he should beold enough to do right also.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities arealways interesting, but generalities in morals mean absolutelynothing. As for saying I left our child to starve, that, ofcourse, is untrue and silly. My mother offered you six hundred ayear. But you wouldn't take anything. You simply disappeared, andcarried the child away with you.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I wouldn't have accepted a penny from her. Yourfather was different. He told you, in my presence, when we were inParis, that it was your duty to marry me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it isnot what one does oneself. Of course, I was influenced by mymother. Every man is when he is young.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I am glad to hear you say so. Gerald shallcertainly not go away with you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. What nonsense, Rachel!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Do you think I would allow my son -
LORD ILLINGWORTH. OUR son.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH shrugs his shoulders] -to go away with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life,who has tainted every moment of my days? You don't realise what mypast has been in suffering and in shame.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I thinkGerald's future considerably more important than your past.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. That is exactly what he should do. That isexactly what you should help him to do. What a typical woman youare! You talk sentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish thewhole time. But don't let us have a scene. Rachel, I want you tolook at this matter from the common-sense point of view, from thepoint of view of what is best for our son, leaving you and me outof the question. What is our son at present? An underpaid clerkin a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate English town. If youimagine he is quite happy in such a position, you are mistaken. Heis thoroughly discontented.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. He was not discontented till he met you. You havemade him so.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Of course, I made him so. Discontent is thefirst step in the progress of a man or a nation. But I did notleave him with a mere longing for things he could not get. No, Imade him a charming offer. He jumped at it, I need hardly say.Any young man would. And now, simply because it turns out that Iam the boy's own father and he my own son, you propose practicallyto ruin his career. That is to say, if I were a perfect stranger,you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but as he is my ownflesh and blood you won't. How utterly illogical you are!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I will not allow him to go.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. How can you prevent it? What excuse can yougive to him for making him decline such an offer as mine? I won'ttell him in what relations I stand to him, I need hardly say. Butyou daren't tell him. You know that. Look how you have broughthim up.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I have brought him up to be a good man.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Quite so. And what is the result? You haveeducated him to be your judge if he ever finds you out. And abitter, an unjust judge he will be to you. Don't be deceived,Rachel. Children begin by loving their parents. After a time theyjudge them. Rarely, if ever, do they forgive them.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. George, don't take my son away from me. I havehad twenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to loveme, only one thing to love. You have had a life of joy, andpleasure, and success. You have been quite happy, you have neverthought of us. There was no reason, according to your views oflife, why you should have remembered us at all. Your meeting uswas a mere accident, a horrible accident. Forget it. Don't comenow, and rob me of . . . of all I have in the whole world. You areso rich in other things. Leave me the little vineyard of my life;leave me the walled-in garden and the well of water; the ewe-lambGod sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that. George, don'ttake Gerald from me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Rachel, at the present moment you are notnecessary to Gerald's career; I am. There is nothing more to besaid on the subject.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I will not let him go.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Here is Gerald. He has a right to decide forhimself.
[Enter GERALD.]
GERALD. Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all withLord Illingworth?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I have not, Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Your mother seems not to like your coming withme, for some reason.
GERALD. Why, mother?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I thought you were quite happy here with me,Gerald. I didn't know you were so anxious to leave me.
GERALD. Mother, how can you talk like that? Of course I have beenquite happy with you. But a man can't stay always with his mother.No chap does. I want to make myself a position, to do something.I thought you would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth'ssecretary.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I do not think you would be suitable as a privatesecretary to Lord Illingworth. You have no qualifications.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. I don't wish to seem to interfere for a moment,Mrs. Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, Isurely am the best judge. And I can only tell you that your sonhas all the qualifications I had hoped for. He has more, in fact,than I had even thought of. Far more. [MRS. ARBUTHNOT remainssilent.] Have you any other reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don'twish your son to accept this post?
GERALD. Have you, mother? Do answer.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.We are quite by ourselves here. Whatever it is, I need not say Iwill not repeat it.
GERALD. Mother?
LORD ILLINGWORTH. If you would like to be alone with your son, Iwill leave you. You may have some other reason you don't wish meto hear.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT. I have no other reason.
LORD ILLINGWORTH. Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing assettled. Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terracetogether. And Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I thinkyou have acted very, very wisely.
[Exit with GERALD. MRS. ARBUTHNOT is left alone. She standsimmobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face.]
