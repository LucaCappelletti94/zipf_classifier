An omnibus across the bridgeCrawls like a yellow butterfly,And, here and there, a passer-byShows like a little restless midge.
Big barges full of yellow hayAre moored against the shadowy wharf,And, like a yellow silken scarf,The thick fog hangs along the quay.
The yellow leaves begin to fadeAnd flutter from the Temple elms,And at my feet the pale green ThamesLies like a rod of rippled jade.
