Hunger is the handmaid of genius --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

One day during our stay in Bombay there was a criminal trial of a mostinteresting sort, a terribly realistic chapter out of the "ArabianNights," a strange mixture of simplicities and pieties and murderouspracticalities, which brought back the forgotten days of Thuggee and madethem live again; in fact, even made them believable.  It was a case wherea young girl had been assassinated for the sake of her triflingornaments, things not worth a laborer's day's wages in America.  Thisthing could have been done in many other countries, but hardly with thecold business-like depravity, absence of fear, absence of caution,destitution of the sense of horror, repentance, remorse, exhibited inthis case.  Elsewhere the murderer would have done his crime secretly, bynight, and without witnesses; his fears would have allowed him no peacewhile the dead body was in his neighborhood; he would not have resteduntil he had gotten it safe out of the way and hidden as effectually ashe could hide it.  But this Indian murderer does his deed in the fulllight of day, cares nothing for the society of witnesses, is in no wayincommoded by the presence of the corpse, takes his own time aboutdisposing of it, and the whole party are so indifferent, so phlegmatic,that they take their regular sleep as if nothing was happening and nohalters hanging over them; and these five bland people close the episodewith a religious service. The thing reads like a Meadows-Taylor Thug-taleof half a century ago, as may be seen by the official report of thetrial:
     "At the Mazagon Police Court yesterday, Superintendent Nolan again     charged Tookaram Suntoo Savat Baya, woman, her daughter Krishni, and     Gopal Yithoo Bhanayker, before Mr. Phiroze Hoshang Dastur, Fourth     Presidency Magistrate, under sections 302 and 109 of the Code, with     having on the night of the 30th of December last murdered a Hindoo     girl named Cassi, aged 12, by strangulation, in the room of a chawl     at Jakaria Bunder, on the Sewriroad, and also with aiding and     abetting each other in the commission of the offense.
     "Mr. F. A. Little, Public Prosecutor, conducted the case on behalf     of the Crown, the accused being undefended.
     "Mr. Little applied under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure     Code to tender pardon to one of the accused, Krishni, woman, aged     22, on her undertaking to make a true and full statement of facts     under which the deceased girl Cassi was murdered.
     "The Magistrate having granted the Public Prosecutor's application,     the accused Krishni went into the witness-box, and, on being     examined by Mr. Little, made the following confession:--I am a     mill-hand employed at the Jubilee Mill.  I recollect the day     (Tuesday); on which the body of the deceased Cassi was found.     Previous to that I attended the mill for half a day, and then     returned home at 3 in the afternoon, when I saw five persons in the     house, viz.: the first accused Tookaram, who is my paramour, my     mother, the second accused Baya, the accused Gopal, and two guests     named Ramji Daji and Annaji Gungaram.  Tookaram rented the room of     the chawl situated at Jakaria Bunder-road from its owner,     Girdharilal Radhakishan, and in that room I, my paramour, Tookaram,     and his younger brother, Yesso Mahadhoo, live.  Since his arrival in     Bombay from his native country Yesso came and lived with us.  When I     returned from the mill on the afternoon of that day, I saw the two     guests seated on a cot in the veranda, and a few minutes after the     accused Gopal came and took his seat by their side, while I and my     mother were seated inside the room.  Tookaram, who had gone out to     fetch some 'pan' and betelnuts, on his return home had brought the     two guests with him.  After returning home he gave them 'pan     supari'.  While they were eating it my mother came out of the room     and inquired of one of the guests, Ramji, what had happened to his     foot, when he replied that he had tried many remedies, but they had     done him no good.  My mother then took some rice in her hand and     prophesied that the disease which Ramji was suffering from would not     be cured until he returned to his native country.  In the meantime     the deceased Casi came from the direction of an out-house, and stood     in front on the threshold of our room with a 'lota' in her hand.     Tookaram then told his two guests to leave the room, and they then     went up the steps towards the quarry.  After the guests had gone     away, Tookaram seized the deceased, who had come into the room, and     he afterwards put a waistband around her, and tied her to a post     which supports a loft. After doing this, he pressed the girl's     throat, and, having tied her mouth with the 'dhotur' (now shown in     Court), fastened it to the post.  Having killed the girl, Tookaram     removed her gold head ornament and a gold 'putlee', and also took     charge of her 'lota'. Besides these two ornaments Cassi had on her     person ear-studs a nose-ring, some silver toe-rings, two necklaces,     a pair of silver anklets and bracelets.  Tookaram afterwards tried     to remove the silver amulets, the ear-studs, and the nose-ring; but     he failed in his attempt.  While he was doing so, I, my mother, and     Gopal were present.  After removing the two gold ornaments, he     handed them over to Gopal, who was at the time standing near me.     When he killed Cassi, Tookaram threatened to strangle me also if I     informed any one of this.  Gopal and myself were then standing at     the door of our room, and we both were threatened by Tookaram.  My     mother, Baya, had seized the legs of the deceased at the time she     was killed, and whilst she was being tied to the post.  Cassi then     made a noise. Tookaram and my mother took part in killing the girl.     After the murder her body was wrapped up in a mattress and kept on     the loft over the door of our room.  When Cassi was strangled, the     door of the room was fastened from the inside by Tookaram.  This     deed was committed shortly after my return home from work in the     mill. Tookaram put the body of the deceased in the mattress, and,     after it was left on the loft, he went to have his head shaved by a     barber named Sambhoo Raghoo, who lives only one door away from me.     My mother and myself then remained in the possession of the     information.  I was slapped and threatened by my paramour, Tookaram,     and that was the only reason why I did not inform any one at that     time.  When I told Tookaram that I would give information of the     occurrence, he slapped me.  The accused Gopal was asked by Tookaram     to go back to his room, and he did so, taking away with him the two     gold ornaments and the 'lota'.  Yesso Mahadhoo, a brother-in-law of     Tookaram, came to the house and asked Taokaram why he was washing,     the water-pipe being just opposite.  Tookaram replied that he was     washing his dhotur, as a fowl had polluted it.  About 6 o'clock of     the evening of that day my mother gave me three pice and asked me to     buy a cocoanut, and I gave the money to Yessoo, who went and fetched     a cocoanut and some betel leaves.  When Yessoo and others were in     the room I was bathing, and, after I finished my bath, my mother     took the cocoanut and the betel leaves from Yessoo, and we five went     to the sea.  The party consisted of Tookaram, my mother, Yessoo,     Tookaram's younger brother, and myself.  On reaching the seashore,     my mother made the offering to the sea, and prayed to be pardoned     for what we had done.  Before we went to the sea, some one came to     inquire after the girl Cassi.  The police and other people came to     make these inquiries both before and after we left the house for the     seashore.  The police questioned my mother about the girl, and she     replied that Cassi had come to her door, but had left.  The next day     the police questioned Tookaram, and he, too, gave a similar reply.     This was said the same night when the search was made for the girl.     After the offering was made to the sea, we partook of the cocoanut     and returned home, when my mother gave me some food; but Tookaram     did not partake of any food that night.  After dinner I and my     mother slept inside the room, and Tookaram slept on a cot near his     brother-in-law, Yessoo Mahadhoo, just outside the door.  That was     not the usual place where Tookaram slept.  He usually slept inside     the room.  The body of the deceased remained on the loft when I went     to sleep.  The room in which we slept was locked, and I heard that     my paramour, Tookaram, was restless outside.  About 3 o'clock the     following morning Tookaram knocked at the door, when both myself and     my mother opened it.  He then told me to go to the steps leading to     the quarry, and see if any one was about.  Those steps lead to a     stable, through which we go to the quarry at the back of the     compound.  When I got to the steps I saw no one there.  Tookaram     asked me if any one was there, and I replied that I could see no one     about.  He then took the body of the deceased from the loft, and     having wrapped it up in his saree, asked me to accompany him to the     steps of the quarry, and I did so.  The 'saree' now produced here     was the same.  Besides the 'saree', there was also a 'cholee' on the     body.  He then carried the body in his arms, and went up the steps,     through the stable, and then to the right hand towards a Sahib's     bungalow, where Tookaram placed the body near a wall.  All the time     I and my mother were with him.  When the body was taken down, Yessoo     was lying on the cot.  After depositing the body under the wall, we     all returned home, and soon after 5 a.m.  the police again came and     took Tookaram away.  About an hour after they returned and took me     and my mother away.  We were questioned about it, when I made a     statement.  Two hours later I was taken to the room, and I pointed     out this waistband, the 'dhotur', the mattress, and the wooden post     to Superintendent Nolan and Inspectors Roberts and Rashanali, in the     presence of my mother and Tookaram.  Tookaram killed the girl Cassi     for her ornaments, which he wanted for the girl to whom he was     shortly going to be married.  The body was found in the same place     where it was deposited by Tookaram."
The criminal side of the native has always been picturesque, alwaysreadable.  The Thuggee and one or two other particularly outrageousfeatures of it have been suppressed by the English, but there is enoughof it left to keep it darkly interesting.  One finds evidence of thesesurvivals in the newspapers.  Macaulay has a light-throwing passage uponthis matter in his great historical sketch of Warren Hastings, where heis describing some effects which followed the temporary paralysis ofHastings' powerful government brought about by Sir Philip Francis and hisparty:
     "The natives considered Hastings as a fallen man; and they acted     after their kind.  Some of our readers may have seen, in India, a     cloud of crows pecking a sick vulture to death--no bad type of what     happens in that country as often as fortune deserts one who has been     great and dreaded.  In an instant all the sycophants, who had lately     been ready to lie for him, to forge for him, to pander for him, to     poison for him, hasten to purchase the favor of his victorious     enemies by accusing him.  An Indian government has only to let it be     understood that it wishes a particular man to be ruined, and in     twenty-four hours it will be furnished with grave charges, supported     by depositions so full and circumstantial that any person     unaccustomed to Asiatic mendacity would regard them as decisive.  It     is well if the signature of the destined victim is not counterfeited     at the foot of some illegal compact, and if some treasonable paper     is not slipped into a hiding-place in his house."
That was nearly a century and a quarter ago.  An article in one of thechief journals of India (the Pioneer) shows that in some respects thenative of to-day is just what his ancestor was then.  Here are nicetiesof so subtle and delicate a sort that they lift their breed of rascalityto a place among the fine arts, and almost entitle it to respect:
     "The records of the Indian courts might certainly be relied upon to     prove that swindlers as a class in the East come very close to, if     they do not surpass, in brilliancy of execution and originality of     design the most expert of their fraternity in Europe and America.     India in especial is the home of forgery.  There are some particular     districts which are noted as marts for the finest specimens of the     forger's handiwork.  The business is carried on by firms who possess     stores of stamped papers to suit every emergency.  They habitually     lay in a store of fresh stamped papers every year, and some of the     older and more thriving houses can supply documents for the past     forty years, bearing the proper water-mark and possessing the     genuine appearance of age.  Other districts have earned notoriety     for skilled perjury, a pre-eminence that excites a respectful     admiration when one thinks of the universal prevalence of the art,     and persons desirous of succeeding in false suits are ready to pay     handsomely to avail themselves of the services of these local     experts as witnesses."
Various instances illustrative of the methods of these swindlers aregiven.  They exhibit deep cunning and total depravity on the part of theswindler and his pals, and more obtuseness on the part of the victim thanone would expect to find in a country where suspicion of your neighbormust surely be one of the earliest things learned.  The favorite subjectis the young fool who has just come into a fortune and is trying to seehow poor a use he can put it to.  I will quote one example:
     "Sometimes another form of confidence trick is adopted, which is     invariably successful.  The particular pigeon is spotted, and, his     acquaintance having been made, he is encouraged in every form of     vice.  When the friendship is thoroughly established, the swindler     remarks to the young man that he has a brother who has asked him to     lend him Rs.10,000.  The swindler says he has the money and would     lend it; but, as the borrower is his brother, he cannot charge     interest.  So he proposes that he should hand the dupe the money,     and the latter should lend it to the swindler's brother, exacting a     heavy pre-payment of interest which, it is pointed out, they may     equally enjoy in dissipation.  The dupe sees no objection, and on     the appointed day receives Rs.7,000 from the swindler, which he     hands over to the confederate.  The latter is profuse in his thanks,     and executes a promissory note for Rs.10,000, payable to bearer.     The swindler allows the scheme to remain quiescent for a time, and     then suggests that, as the money has not been repaid and as it would     be unpleasant to sue his brother, it would be better to sell the     note in the bazaar.  The dupe hands the note over, for the money he     advanced was not his, and, on being informed that it would be     necessary to have his signature on the back so as to render the     security negotiable, he signs without any hesitation.  The swindler     passes it on to confederates, and the latter employ a respectable     firm of solicitors to ask the dupe if his signature is genuine.  He     admits it at once, and his fate is sealed.  A suit is filed by a     confederate against the dupe, two accomplices being made     co-defendants.  They admit their Signatures as indorsers, and the     one swears he bought the note for value from the dupe.  The latter     has no defense, for no court would believe the apparently idle     explanation of the manner in which he came to endorse the note."
There is only one India!  It is the only country that has a monopoly ofgrand and imposing specialties.  When another country has a remarkablething, it cannot have it all to itself--some other country has aduplicate.  But India--that is different.  Its marvels are its own; thepatents cannot be infringed; imitations are not possible.  And think ofthe size of them, the majesty of them, the weird and outlandish characterof the most of them!
There is the Plague, the Black Death: India invented it; India is thecradle of that mighty birth.
The Car of Juggernaut was India's invention.
So was the Suttee; and within the time of men still living eight hundredwidows willingly, and, in fact, rejoicingly, burned themselves to deathon the bodies of their dead husbands in a single year.  Eight hundredwould do it this year if the British government would let them.
Famine is India's specialty.  Elsewhere famines are inconsequentialincidents--in India they are devastating cataclysms; in one case theyannihilate hundreds; in the other, millions.
India had 2,000,000 gods, and worships them all.  In religion all othercountries are paupers; India is the only millionaire.
With her everything is on a giant scale--even her poverty; no othercountry can show anything to compare with it.  And she has been used towealth on so vast a scale that she has to shorten to single words theexpressions describing great sums.  She describes 100,000 with one word--a 'lahk'; she describes ten millions with one word--a 'crore'.
In the bowels of the granite mountains she has patiently carved outdozens of vast temples, and made them glorious with sculptured colonnadesand stately groups of statuary, and has adorned the eternal walls withnoble paintings.  She has built fortresses of such magnitude that theshow-strongholds of the rest of the world are but modest little things bycomparison; palaces that are wonders for rarity of materials, delicacyand beauty of workmanship, and for cost; and one tomb which men go aroundthe globe to see.  It takes eighty nations, speaking eighty languages, topeople her, and they number three hundred millions.
On top of all this she is the mother and home of that wonder of wonderscaste--and of that mystery of mysteries, the satanic brotherhood of theThugs.
India had the start of the whole world in the beginning of things.  Shehad the first civilization; she had the first accumulation of materialwealth; she was populous with deep thinkers and subtle intellects; shehad mines, and woods, and a fruitful soil.  It would seem as if sheshould have kept the lead, and should be to-day not the meek dependent ofan alien master, but mistress of the world, and delivering law andcommand to every tribe and nation in it.  But, in truth, there was neverany possibility of such supremacy for her.  If there had been but oneIndia and one language--but there were eighty of them!  Where there areeighty nations and several hundred governments, fighting and quarrelingmust be the common business of life; unity of purpose and policy areimpossible; out of such elements supremacy in the world cannot come.Even caste itself could have had the defeating effect of a multiplicityof tongues, no doubt; for it separates a people into layers, and layers,and still other layers, that have no community of feeling with eachother; and in such a condition of things as that, patriotism can have nohealthy growth.
It was the division of the country into so many States and nations thatmade Thuggee possible and prosperous.  It is difficult to realize thesituation.  But perhaps one may approximate it by imagining the States ofour Union peopled by separate nations, speaking separate languages, withguards and custom-houses strung along all frontiers, plenty ofinterruptions for travelers and traders, interpreters able to handle allthe languages very rare or non-existent, and a few wars always going onhere and there and yonder as a further embarrassment to commerce andexcursioning.  It would make intercommunication in a measure ungeneral.India had eighty languages, and more custom-houses than cats.  No cleverman with the instinct of a highway robber could fail to notice what achance for business was here offered.  India was full of clever men withthe highwayman instinct, and so, quite naturally, the brotherhood of theThugs came into being to meet the long-felt want.
How long ago that was nobody knows-centuries, it is supposed.  One of thechiefest wonders connected with it was the success with which it kept itssecret.  The English trader did business in India two hundred years andmore before he ever heard of it; and yet it was assassinating itsthousands all around him every year, the whole time.
