Weaving the Net About Her
IT WAS necessary for me to have some way to gain bread for Noel andmyself; and when the Pierrons found that I knew how to write, the appliedto their confessor in my behalf, and he got a place for me with a goodpriest named Manchon, who was to be the chief recorder in the Great Trialof Joan of Arc now approaching. It was a strange position for me--clerkto the recorder--and dangerous if my sympathies and the late employmentshould be found out. But there was not much danger. Manchon was at bottomfriendly to Joan and would not betray me; and my name would not, for Ihad discarded my surname and retained only my given one, like a person oflow degree.
I attended Manchon constantly straight along, out of January and intoFebruary, and was often in the citadel with him--in the very fortresswhere Joan was imprisoned, though not in the dungeon where she wasconfined, and so did not see her, of course.
Manchon told me everything that had been happening before my coming. Eversince the purchase of Joan, Cauchon had been busy packing his jury forthe destruction of the Maid--weeks and weeks he had spent in this badindustry. The University of Paris had sent him a number of learned andable and trusty ecclesiastics of the stripe he wanted; and he had scrapedtogether a clergyman of like stripe and great fame here and there andyonder, until he was able to construct a formidable court numbering halfa hundred distinguished names. French names they were, but theirinterests and sympathies were English.
A great officer of the Inquisition was also sent from Paris for theaccused must be tried by the forms of the Inquisition; but this was abrave and righteous man, and he said squarely that this court had nopower to try the case, wherefore he refused to act; and the same honesttalk was uttered by two or three others.
The Inquisitor was right. The case as here resurrected against Joan hadalready been tried long ago at Poitiers, and decided in her favor. Yes,and by a higher tribunal than this one, for at the head of it was anArchbishop--he of Rheims--Cauchon's own metropolitan. So here, you see, alower court was impudently preparing to try and redecide a cause whichhad already been decided by its superior, a court of higher authority.Imagine it! No, the case could not properly be tried again. Cauchon couldnot properly preside in this new court, for more than one reason:
Rouen was not in his diocese; Joan had not been arrested in her domicile,which was still Domremy; and finally this proposed judge was theprisoner's outspoken enemy, and therefore he was incompetent to try her.Yet all these large difficulties were gotten rid of. The territorialChapter of Rouen finally granted territorial letters to Cauchon--thoughonly after a struggle and under compulsion. Force was also applied to theInquisitor, and he was obliged to submit.
So then, the little English King, by his representative, formallydelivered Joan into the hands of the court, but with this reservation: ifthe court failed to condemn her, he was to have her back again! Ah,dear, what chance was there for that forsaken and friendless child?Friendless, indeed--it is the right word. For she was in a black dungeon,with half a dozen brutal common soldiers keeping guard night and day inthe room where her cage was--for she was in a cage; an iron cage, andchained to her bed by neck and hands and feet. Never a person near herwhom she had ever seen before; never a woman at all. Yes, this was,indeed, friendlessness.
Now it was a vassal of Jean de Luxembourg who captured Joan andCompiegne, and it was Jean who sold her to the Duke of Burgundy. Yet thisvery De Luxembourg was shameless enough to go and show his face to Joanin her cage. He came with two English earls, Warwick and Stafford. He wasa poor reptile. He told her he would get her set free if she wouldpromise not to fight the English any more. She had been in that cage along time now, but not long enough to break her spirit. She retortedscornfully:
"Name of God, you but mock me. I know that you have neither the power northe will to do it."
He insisted. Then the pride and dignity of the soldier rose in Joan, andshe lifted her chained hands and let them fall with a clash, saying:
"See these! They know more than you, an can prophesy better. I know thatthe English are going to kill me, for they think that when I am dead theycan get the Kingdom of France. It is not so.
"Though there were a hundred thousand of them they would never get it."
This defiance infuriated Stafford, and he--now think of it--he a free,strong man, she a chained and helpless girl--he drew his dagger and flunghimself at her to stab her. But Warwick seized him and held him back.Warwick was wise. Take her life in that way? Send her to Heaven stainlessand undisgraced? It would make her the idol of France, and the wholenation would rise and march to victory and emancipation under theinspiration of her spirit. No, she must be saved for another fate thanthat.
Well, the time was approaching for the Great Trial. For more than twomonths Cauchon had been raking and scraping everywhere for any odds andends of evidence or suspicion or conjecture that might be usable againstJoan, and carefully suppressing all evidence that came to hand in herfavor. He had limitless ways and means and powers at his disposal forpreparing and strengthening the case for the prosecution, and he usedthem all.
But Joan had no one to prepare her case for her, and she was shut up inthose stone walls and had no friend to appeal to for help. And as forwitnesses, she could not call a single one in her defense; they were allfar away, under the French flag, and this was an English court; theywould have been seized and hanged if they had shown their faces at thegates of Rouen. No, the prisoner must be the sole witness--witness forthe prosecution, witness for the defense; and with a verdict of deathresolved upon before the doors were opened for the court's first sitting.
When she learned that the court was made up of ecclesiastics in theinterest of the English, she begged that in fairness an equal number ofpriests of the French party should be added to these.
Cauchon scoffed at her message, and would not even deign to answer it.
By the law of the Church--she being a minor under twenty-one--it was herright to have counsel to conduct her case, advise her how to answer whenquestioned, and protect her from falling into traps set by cunningdevices of the prosecution. She probably did not know that this was herright, and that she could demand it and require it, for there was none totell her that; but she begged for this help, at any rate. Cauchon refusedit. She urged and implored, pleading her youth and her ignorance of thecomplexities and intricacies of the law and of legal procedure. Cauchonrefused again, and said she must get along with her case as best shemight by herself. Ah, his heart was a stone.
Cauchon prepared the proces verbal. I will simplify that by calling itthe Bill of Particulars. It was a detailed list of the charges againsther, and formed the basis of the trial. Charges? It was a list ofsuspicions and public rumors--those were the words used. It was merelycharged that she was suspected of having been guilty of heresies,witchcraft, and other such offenses against religion.
Now by the law of the Church, a trial of that sort could not be begununtil a searching inquiry had been made into the history and character ofthe accused, and it was essential that the result of this inquiry beadded to the proces verbal and form a part of it. You remember that thatwas the first thing they did before the trial at Poitiers. They did itagain now. An ecclesiastic was sent to Domremy. There and all about theneighborhood he made an exhaustive search into Joan's history andcharacter, and came back with his verdict. It was very clear. Thesearcher reported that he found Joan's character to be in every way whathe "would like his own sister's character to be." Just about the samereport that was brought back to Poitiers, you see. Joan's was a characterwhich could endure the minutest examination.
This verdict was a strong point for Joan, you will say. Yes, it wouldhave been if it could have seen the light; but Cauchon was awake, and itdisappeared from the proces verbal before the trial. People were prudentenough not to inquire what became of it.
One would imagine that Cauchon was ready to begin the trial by this time.But no, he devised one more scheme for poor Joan's destruction, and itpromised to be a deadly one.
One of the great personages picked out and sent down by the University ofParis was an ecclesiastic named Nicolas Loyseleur. He was tall, handsome,grave, of smooth, soft speech and courteous and winning manners. Therewas no seeming of treachery or hypocrisy about him, yet he was full ofboth. He was admitted to Joan's prison by night, disguised as a cobbler;he pretended to be from her own country; he professed to be secretly apatriot; he revealed the fact that he was a priest. She was filled withgladness to see one from the hills and plains that were so dear to her;happier still to look upon a priest and disburden her heart inconfession, for the offices of the Church were the bread of life, thebreath of her nostrils to her, and she had been long forced to pine forthem in vain. She opened her whole innocent heart to this creature, andin return he gave her advice concerning her trial which could havedestroyed her if her deep native wisdom had not protected her againstfollowing it.
You will ask, what value could this scheme have, since the secrets of theconfessional are sacred and cannot be revealed? True--but suppose anotherperson should overhear them? That person is not bound to keep the secret.Well, that is what happened. Cauchon had previously caused a hole to bebored through the wall; and he stood with his ear to that hole and heardall. It is pitiful to think of these things. One wonders how they couldtreat that poor child so. She had not done them any harm.
