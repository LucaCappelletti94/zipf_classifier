Chapter IIf I understand the idea, the BAZAR invites several of us towrite upon the above text. It means the change in my life'scourse which introduced what must be regarded by me as the mostIMPORTANT condition of my career. But it also implies--withoutintention, perhaps--that that turning-point ITSELF was thecreator of the new condition. This gives it too muchdistinction, too much prominence, too much credit. It is onlythe LAST link in a very long chain of turning-points commissionedto produce the cardinal result; it is not any more important thanthe humblest of its ten thousand predecessors. Each of the tenthousand did its appointed share, on its appointed date, inforwarding the scheme, and they were all necessary; to have leftout any one of them would have defeated the scheme and broughtabout SOME OTHER result. It know we have a fashion of saying"such and such an event was the turning-point in my life," but weshouldn't say it. We should merely grant that its place as LASTlink in the chain makes it the most CONSPICUOUS link; in realimportance it has no advantage over any one of its predecessors.Perhaps the most celebrated turning-point recorded inhistory was the crossing of the Rubicon. Suetonius says:Coming up with his troops on the banks of the Rubicon, hehalted for a while, and, revolving in his mind the importance ofthe step he was on the point of taking, he turned to those abouthim and said, "We may still retreat; but if we pass this littlebridge, nothing is left for us but to fight it out in arms."This was a stupendously important moment. And all theincidents, big and little, of Caesar's previous life had beenleading up to it, stage by stage, link by link. This was theLAST link--merely the last one, and no bigger than the others;but as we gaze back at it through the inflating mists of ourimagination, it looks as big as the orbit of Neptune.You, the reader, have a PERSONAL interest in that link, andso have I; so has the rest of the human race. It was one of thelinks in your life-chain, and it was one of the links in mine.We may wait, now, with baited breath, while Caesar reflects.Your fate and mine are involved in his decision.While he was thus hesitating, the following incidentoccurred. A person remarked for his noble mien and gracefulaspect appeared close at hand, sitting and playing upon a pipe.When not only the shepherds, but a number of soldiers also,flocked to listen to him, and some trumpeters among them, hesnatched a trumpet from one of them, ran to the river with it,and, sounding the advance with a piercing blast, crossed to theother side. Upon this, Caesar exclaimed: "Let us go whither theomens of the gods and the iniquity of our enemies call up.THE DIE IS CAST."So he crossed--and changed the future of the whole humanrace, for all time. But that stranger was a link in Caesar'slife-chain, too; and a necessary one. We don't know his name, wenever hear of him again; he was very casual; he acts like anaccident; but he was no accident, he was there by compulsion ofHIS life-chain, to blow the electrifying blast that was to makeup Caesar's mind for him, and thence go piping down the aisles ofhistory forever.If the stranger hadn't been there! But he WAS. And Caesarcrossed. With such results! Such vast events--each a link inthe HUMAN RACE'S life-chain; each event producing the next one,and that one the next one, and so on: the destruction of therepublic; the founding of the empire; the breaking up of theempire; the rise of Christianity upon its ruins; the spread ofthe religion to other lands--and so on; link by link took itsappointed place at its appointed time, the discovery of Americabeing one of them; our Revolution another; the inflow of Englishand other immigrants another; their drift westward (my ancestorsamong them) another; the settlement of certain of them inMissouri, which resulted in ME. For I was one of the unavoidableresults of the crossing of the Rubicon. If the stranger, withhis trumpet blast, had stayed away (which he COULDN'T, for he wasthe appointed link) Caesar would not have crossed. What wouldhave happened, in that case, we can never guess. We only knowthat the things that did happen would not have happened. Theymight have been replaced by equally prodigious things, of course,but their nature and results are beyond our guessing. But thematter that interests me personally is that I would not be HEREnow, but somewhere else; and probably black--there is no telling.Very well, I am glad he crossed. And very really and thankfullyglad, too, though I never cared anything about it before.Chapter IITo me, the most important feature of my life is its literaryfeature. I have been professionally literary something more thanforty years. There have been many turning-points in my life, butthe one that was the link in the chain appointed to conduct me tothe literary guild is the most CONSPICUOUS link in that chain.BECAUSE it was the last one. It was not any more important thanits predecessors. All the other links have an inconspicuouslook, except the crossing of the Rubicon; but as factors inmaking me literary they are all of the one size, the crossing ofthe Rubicon included.I know how I came to be literary, and I will tell the stepsthat lead up to it and brought it about.The crossing of the Rubicon was not the first one, it washardly even a recent one; I should have to go back ages beforeCaesar's day to find the first one. To save space I will go backonly a couple of generations and start with an incident of myboyhood. When I was twelve and a half years old, my father died.It was in the spring. The summer came, and brought with it anepidemic of measles. For a time a child died almost every day.The village was paralyzed with fright, distress, despair.Children that were not smitten with the disease were imprisonedin their homes to save them from the infection. In the homesthere were no cheerful faces, there was no music, there was nosinging but of solemn hymns, no voice but of prayer, no rompingwas allowed, no noise, no laughter, the family moved spectrallyabout on tiptoe, in a ghostly hush. I was a prisoner. My soulwas steeped in this awful dreariness--and in fear. At some timeor other every day and every night a sudden shiver shook me tothe marrow, and I said to myself, "There, I've got it! and Ishall die." Life on these miserable terms was not worth living,and at last I made up my mind to get the disease and have itover, one way or the other. I escaped from the house and went tothe house of a neighbor where a playmate of mine was very illwith the malady. When the chance offered I crept into his roomand got into bed with him. I was discovered by his mother andsent back into captivity. But I had the disease; they could nottake that from me. I came near to dying. The whole village wasinterested, and anxious, and sent for news of me every day; andnot only once a day, but several times. Everybody believed Iwould die; but on the fourteenth day a change came for the worseand they were disappointed.This was a turning-point of my life. (Link number one.)For when I got well my mother closed my school career andapprenticed me to a printer. She was tired of trying to keep meout of mischief, and the adventure of the measles decided her toput me into more masterful hands than hers.I became a printer, and began to add one link after anotherto the chain which was to lead me into the literary profession.A long road, but I could not know that; and as I did not knowwhat its goal was, or even that it had one, I was indifferent.Also contented.A young printer wanders around a good deal, seeking andfinding work; and seeking again, when necessity commands. N. B.Necessity is a CIRCUMSTANCE; Circumstance is man's master--andwhen Circumstance commands, he must obey; he may argue thematter--that is his privilege, just as it is the honorableprivilege of a falling body to argue with the attraction ofgravitation--but it won't do any good, he must OBEY. I wanderedfor ten years, under the guidance and dictatorship ofCircumstance, and finally arrived in a city of Iowa, where Iworked several months. Among the books that interested me inthose days was one about the Amazon. The traveler told analluring tale of his long voyage up the great river from Para tothe sources of the Madeira, through the heart of an enchantedland, a land wastefully rich in tropical wonders, a romantic landwhere all the birds and flowers and animals were of the museumvarieties, and where the alligator and the crocodile and themonkey seemed as much at home as if they were in the Zoo. Also,he told an astonishing tale about COCA, a vegetable product ofmiraculous powers, asserting that it was so nourishing and sostrength-giving that the native of the mountains of the Madeiraregion would tramp up hill and down all day on a pinch ofpowdered coca and require no other sustenance.I was fired with a longing to ascend the Amazon. Also witha longing to open up a trade in coca with all the world. Duringmonths I dreamed that dream, and tried to contrive ways to get toPara and spring that splendid enterprise upon an unsuspectingplanet. But all in vain. A person may PLAN as much as he wantsto, but nothing of consequence is likely to come of it until themagician CIRCUMSTANCE steps in and takes the matter off hishands. At last Circumstance came to my help. It was in thisway. Circumstance, to help or hurt another man, made him lose afifty-dollar bill in the street; and to help or hurt me, made mefind it. I advertised the find, and left for the Amazon the sameday. This was another turning-point, another link.Could Circumstance have ordered another dweller in that townto go to the Amazon and open up a world-trade in coca on a fifty-dollar basis and been obeyed? No, I was the only one. Therewere other fools there--shoals and shoals of them--but they werenot of my kind. I was the only one of my kind.Circumstance is powerful, but it cannot work alone; it hasto have a partner. Its partner is man's TEMPERAMENT--his naturaldisposition. His temperament is not his invention, it is BORN inhim, and he has no authority over it, neither is he responsiblefor its acts. He cannot change it, nothing can change it,nothing can modify it--except temporarily. But it won't staymodified. It is permanent, like the color of the man's eyes andthe shape of his ears. Blue eyes are gray in certain unusual lights;but they resume their natural color when that stress is removed.A Circumstance that will coerce one man will have no effectupon a man of a different temperament. If Circumstance hadthrown the bank-note in Caesar's way, his temperament would nothave made him start for the Amazon. His temperament would havecompelled him to do something with the money, but not that. Itmight have made him advertise the note--and WAIT. We can't tell.Also, it might have made him go to New York and buy into theGovernment, with results that would leave Tweed nothing to learnwhen it came his turn.Very well, Circumstance furnished the capital, and mytemperament told me what to do with it. Sometimes a temperamentis an ass. When that is the case of the owner of it is an ass,too, and is going to remain one. Training, experience,association, can temporarily so polish him, improve him, exalthim that people will think he is a mule, but they will bemistaken. Artificially he IS a mule, for the time being, but atbottom he is an ass yet, and will remain one.By temperament I was the kind of person that DOES things.Does them, and reflects afterward. So I started for the Amazonwithout reflecting and without asking any questions. That wasmore than fifty years ago. In all that time my temperament hasnot changed, by even a shade. I have been punished many and manya time, and bitterly, for doing things and reflecting afterward,but these tortures have been of no value to me; I still do thething commanded by Circumstance and Temperament, and reflectafterward. Always violently. When I am reflecting, on theseoccasions, even deaf persons can hear me think.I went by the way of Cincinnati, and down the Ohio andMississippi. My idea was to take ship, at New Orleans, for Para.In New Orleans I inquired, and found there was no ship leavingfor Para. Also, that there never had BEEN one leaving for Para.I reflected. A policeman came and asked me what I was doing, andI told him. He made me move on, and said if he caught mereflecting in the public street again he would run me in.After a few days I was out of money. Then Circumstancearrived, with another turning-point of my life--a new link. Onmy way down, I had made the acquaintance of a pilot. I beggedhim to teach me the river, and he consented. I became a pilot.By and by Circumstance came again--introducing the CivilWar, this time, in order to push me ahead another stage or twotoward the literary profession. The boats stopped running, mylivelihood was gone.Circumstance came to the rescue with a new turning-point anda fresh link. My brother was appointed secretary to the newTerritory of Nevada, and he invited me to go with him and helphim in his office. I accepted.In Nevada, Circumstance furnished me the silver fever and Iwent into the mines to make a fortune, as I supposed; but thatwas not the idea. The idea was to advance me another step towardliterature. For amusement I scribbled things for the VirginiaCity ENTERPRISE. One isn't a printer ten years without settingup acres of good and bad literature, and learning--unconsciouslyat first, consciously later--to discriminate between the two,within his mental limitations; and meantime he is unconsciouslyacquiring what is called a "style." One of my efforts attractedattention, and the ENTERPRISE sent for me and put me on its staff.And so I became a journalist--another link. By and by Circumstanceand the Sacramento UNION sent me to the Sandwich Islands for fiveor six months, to write up sugar. I did it; and threw in a gooddeal of extraneous matter that hadn't anything to do with sugar.But it was this extraneous matter that helped me to another link.It made me notorious, and San Francisco invited me to lecture.Which I did. And profitably. I had long had a desire to traveland see the world, and now Circumstance had most kindly andunexpectedly hurled me upon the platform and furnished me the means.So I joined the "Quaker City Excursion."When I returned to America, Circumstance was waiting on the pier--with the LAST link--the conspicuous, the consummating, thevictorious link: I was asked to WRITE A BOOK, and I did it, andcalled it THE INNOCENTS ABROAD. Thus I became at last a memberof the literary guild. That was forty-two years ago, and I havebeen a member ever since. Leaving the Rubicon incident away backwhere it belongs, I can say with truth that the reason I am inthe literary profession is because I had the measles when I wastwelve years old.Chapter IIINow what interests me, as regards these details, is not thedetails themselves, but the fact that none of them was foreseenby me, none of them was planned by me, I was the author of noneof them. Circumstance, working in harness with my temperament,created them all and compelled them all. I often offered help,and with the best intentions, but it was rejected--as a rule,uncourteously. I could never plan a thing and get it to come outthe way I planned it. It came out some other way--some way I hadnot counted upon.And so I do not admire the human being--as an intellectualmarvel--as much as I did when I was young, and got him out ofbooks, and did not know him personally. When I used to read thatsuch and such a general did a certain brilliant thing, I believedit. Whereas it was not so. Circumstance did it by help of histemperament. The circumstances would have failed of effect witha general of another temperament: he might see the chance, butlose the advantage by being by nature too slow or too quick ortoo doubtful. Once General Grant was asked a question about amatter which had been much debated by the public and thenewspapers; he answered the question without any hesitancy."General, who planned the the march through Georgia?" "Theenemy!" He added that the enemy usually makes your plans foryou. He meant that the enemy by neglect or through force ofcircumstances leaves an opening for you, and you see your chanceand take advantage of it.Circumstances do the planning for us all, no doubt, by helpof our temperaments. I see no great difference between a man anda watch, except that the man is conscious and the watch isn't,and the man TRIES to plan things and the watch doesn't. Thewatch doesn't wind itself and doesn't regulate itself--thesethings are done exteriorly. Outside influences, outsidecircumstances, wind the MAN and regulate him. Left to himself,he wouldn't get regulated at all, and the sort of time he wouldkeep would not be valuable. Some rare men are wonderful watches,with gold case, compensation balance, and all those things, andsome men are only simple and sweet and humble Waterburys. I am aWaterbury. A Waterbury of that kind, some say.A nation is only an individual multiplied. It makes plansand Circumstances comes and upsets them--or enlarges them. Somepatriots throw the tea overboard; some other patriots destroy aBastille. The PLANS stop there; then Circumstance comes in,quite unexpectedly, and turns these modest riots into a revolution.And there was poor Columbus. He elaborated a deep plan tofind a new route to an old country. Circumstance revised hisplan for him, and he found a new WORLD. And HE gets the creditof it to this day. He hadn't anything to do with it.Necessarily the scene of the real turning-point of my life(and of yours) was the Garden of Eden. It was there that thefirst link was forged of the chain that was ultimately to lead tothe emptying of me into the literary guild. Adam's TEMPERAMENTwas the first command the Deity ever issued to a human being onthis planet. And it was the only command Adam would NEVER beable to disobey. It said, "Be weak, be water, be characterless,be cheaply persuadable." The latter command, to let the fruitalone, was certain to be disobeyed. Not by Adam himself, but byhis TEMPERAMENT--which he did not create and had no authorityover. For the TEMPERAMENT is the man; the thing tricked out withclothes and named Man is merely its Shadow, nothing more. Thelaw of the tiger's temperament is, Thou shalt kill; the law ofthe sheep's temperament is Thou shalt not kill. To issue latercommands requiring the tiger to let the fat stranger alone, andrequiring the sheep to imbue its hands in the blood of the lionis not worth while, for those commands CAN'T be obeyed. Theywould invite to violations of the law of TEMPERAMENT, which issupreme, and take precedence of all other authorities. I cannothelp feeling disappointed in Adam and Eve. That is, in theirtemperaments. Not in THEM, poor helpless young creatures--afflicted with temperaments made out of butter; which butter wascommanded to get into contact with fire and BE MELTED. What Icannot help wishing is, that Adam had been postponed, and MartinLuther and Joan of Arc put in their place--that splendid pairequipped with temperaments not made of butter, but of asbestos.By neither sugary persuasions nor by hell fire could Satan havebeguiled THEM to eat the apple. There would have been results!Indeed, yes. The apple would be intact today; there would be nohuman race; there would be no YOU; there would be no ME. And theold, old creation-dawn scheme of ultimately launching me into theliterary guild would have been defeated.
