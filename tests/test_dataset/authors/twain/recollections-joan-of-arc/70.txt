Respited Only for Torture
THERE IS no certainty that any one in all Rouen was in the secret of thedeep game which Cauchon was playing except the Cardinal of Winchester.Then you can imagine the astonishment and stupefaction of that vast mobgathered there and those crowds of churchmen assembled on the twoplatforms, when they saw Joan of Arc moving away, alive andwhole--slipping out of their grip at last, after all this tediouswaiting, all this tantalizing expectancy.
Nobody was able to stir or speak for a while, so paralyzing was theuniversal astonishment, so unbelievable the fact that the stake wasactually standing there unoccupied and its prey gone.
Then suddenly everybody broke into a fury of rage; maledictions andcharges of treachery began to fly freely; yes, and even stones: a stonecame near killing the Cardinal of Winchester--it just missed his head.But the man who threw it was not to blame, for he was excited, and aperson who is excited never can throw straight.
The tumult was very great, indeed, for a while. In the midst of it achaplain of the Cardinal even forgot the proprieties so far as tooppobriously assail the August Bishop of Beauvais himself, shaking hisfist in his face and shouting:
"By God, you are a traitor!"
"You lie!" responded the Bishop.
He a traitor! Oh, far from it; he certainly was the last Frenchman thatany Briton had a right to bring that charge against.
The Early of Warwick lost his temper, too. He was a doughty soldier, butwhen it came to the intellectuals--when it came to delicate chicane, andscheming, and trickery--he couldn't see any further through a millstonethan another. So he burst out in his frank warrior fashion, and sworethat the King of England was being treacherously used, and that Joan ofArc was going to be allowed to cheat the stake. But they whisperedcomfort into his ear:
"Give yourself no uneasiness, my lord; we shall soon have her again."
Perhaps the like tidings found their way all around, for good newstravels fast as well as bad. At any rate, the ragings presently quieteddown, and the huge concourse crumbled apart and disappeared. And thus wereached the noon of that fearful Thursday.
We two youths were happy; happier than any words can tell--for we werenot in the secret any more than the rest. Joan's life was saved. We knewthat, and that was enough. France would hear of this day's infamouswork--and then! Why, then her gallant sons would flock to her standard bythousands and thousands, multitudes upon multitudes, and their wrathwould be like the wrath of the ocean when the storm-winds sweep it; andthey would hurl themselves against this doomed city and overwhelm it likethe resistless tides of that ocean, and Joan of Arc would march again!
In six days--seven days--one short week--noble France, grateful France,indignant France, would be thundering at these gates--let us count thehours, let us count the minutes, let us count the seconds! O happy day, Oday of ecstasy, how our hearts sang in our bosoms!
For we were young then, yes, we were very young.
Do you think the exhausted prisoner was allowed to rest and sleep aftershe had spent the small remnant of her strength in dragging her tiredbody back to the dungeon?
No, there was no rest for her, with those sleuth-hounds on her track.Cauchon and some of his people followed her to her lair straightway; theyfound her dazed and dull, her mental and physical forces in a state ofprostration. They told her she had abjured; that she had made certainpromises--among them, to resume the apparel of her sex; and that if sherelapsed, the Church would cast her out for good and all. She heard thewords, but they had no meaning to her. She was like a person who hastaken a narcotic and is dying for sleep, dying for rest from nagging,dying to be let alone, and who mechanically does everything thepersecutor asks, taking but dull note of the things done, and but dullyrecording them in the memory. And so Joan put on the gown which Cauchonand his people had brought; and would come to herself by and by, and haveat first but a dim idea as to when and how the change had come about.
Cauchon went away happy and content. Joan had resumed woman's dresswithout protest; also she had been formally warned against relapsing. Hehad witnesses to these facts. How could matters be better?
But suppose she should not relapse?
Why, then she must be forced to do it.
Did Cauchon hint to the English guards that thenceforth if they chose tomake their prisoner's captivity crueler and bitterer than ever, noofficial notice would be taken of it? Perhaps so; since the guards didbegin that policy at once, and no official notice was taken of it. Yes,from that moment Joan's life in that dungeon was made almost unendurable.Do not ask me to enlarge upon it. I will not do it.
