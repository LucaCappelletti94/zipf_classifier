Her Sure Deliverance Foretold
THE NEXT sitting opened on Thursday the first of March. Fifty-eightjudges present--the others resting.
As usual, Joan was required to take an oath without reservations. Sheshowed no temper this time. She considered herself well buttressed by theproces verbal compromise which Cauchon was so anxious to repudiate andcreep out of; so she merely refused, distinctly and decidedly; and added,in a spirit of fairness and candor:
"But as to matters set down in the proces verbal, I will freely tell thewhole truth--yes, as freely and fully as if I were before the Pope."
Here was a chance! We had two or three Popes, then; only one of themcould be the true Pope, of course. Everybody judiciously shirked thequestion of which was the true Pope and refrained from naming him, itbeing clearly dangerous to go into particulars in this matter. Here wasan opportunity to trick an unadvised girl into bringing herself intoperil, and the unfair judge lost no time in taking advantage of it. Heasked, in a plausibly indolent and absent way:
"Which one do you consider to be the true Pope?"
The house took an attitude of deep attention, and so waited to hear theanswer and see the prey walk into the trap. But when the answer came itcovered the judge with confusion, and you could see many people covertlychuckling. For Joan asked in a voice and manner which almost deceivedeven me, so innocent it seemed:
"Are there two?"
One of the ablest priests in that body and one of the best swearersthere, spoke right out so that half the house heard him, and said:
"By God, it was a master stroke!"
As soon as the judge was better of his embarrassment he came back to thecharge, but was prudent and passed by Joan's question:
"Is it true that you received a letter from the Count of Armagnac askingyou which of the three Popes he ought to obey?"
"Yes, and answered it."
Copies of both letters were produced and read. Joan said that hers hadnot been quite strictly copied. She said she had received the Count'sletter when she was just mounting her horse; and added:
"So, in dictating a word or two of reply I said I would try to answer himfrom Paris or somewhere where I could be at rest."
She was asked again which Pope she had considered the right one.
"I was not able to instruct the Count of Armagnac as to which one heought to obey"; then she added, with a frank fearlessness which soundedfresh and wholesome in that den of trimmers and shufflers, "but as forme, I hold that we are bound to obey our Lord the Pope who is at Rome."
The matter was dropped. They produced and read a copy of Joan's firsteffort at dictating--her proclamation summoning the English to retirefrom the siege of Orleans and vacate France--truly a great and fineproduction for an unpractised girl of seventeen.
"Do you acknowledge as your own the document which has just been read?"
"Yes, except that there are errors in it--words which make me give myselftoo much importance." I saw what was coming; I was troubled and ashamed."For instance, I did not say 'Deliver up to the Maid' (rendez au laPucelle); I said 'Deliver up to the King' (rendez au Roi); and I did notcall myself 'Commander-in-Chief' (chef de guerre). All those are wordswhich my secretary substituted; or mayhap he misheard me or forgot what Isaid."
She did not look at me when she said it: she spared me thatembarrassment. I hadn't misheard her at all, and hadn't forgotten. Ichanged her language purposely, for she was Commander-in-Chief andentitled to call herself so, and it was becoming and proper, too; and whowas going to surrender anything to the King?--at that time a stick, acipher? If any surrendering was done, it would be to the noble Maid ofVaucouleurs, already famed and formidable though she had not yet struck ablow.
Ah, there would have been a fine and disagreeable episode (for me) there,if that pitiless court had discovered that the very scribbler of thatpiece of dictation, secretary to Joan of Arc, was present--and not onlypresent, but helping build the record; and not only that, but destined ata far distant day to testify against lies and perversions smuggled intoit by Cauchon and deliver them over to eternal infamy!
"Do you acknowledge that you dictated this proclamation?"
"I do."
"Have you repented of it? Do you retract it?"
Ah, then she was indignant!
"No! Not even these chains"--and she shook them--"not even these chainscan chill the hopes that I uttered there. And more!"--she rose, and stooda moment with a divine strange light kindling in her face, then her wordsburst forth as in a flood--"I warn you now that before seven years adisaster will smite the English, oh, many fold greater than the fall ofOrleans! and--"
"Silence! Sit down!"
"--and then, soon after, they will lose all France!"
Now consider these things. The French armies no longer existed. TheFrench cause was standing still, our King was standing still, there wasno hint that by and by the Constable Richemont would come forward andtake up the great work of Joan of Arc and finish it. In face of all this,Joan made that prophecy--made it with perfect confidence--and it cametrue. For within five years Paris fell--1436--and our King marched intoit flying the victor's flag. So the first part of the prophecy was thenfulfilled--in fact, almost the entire prophecy; for, with Paris in ourhands, the fulfilment of the rest of it was assured.
Twenty years later all France was ours excepting a single town--Calais.
Now that will remind you of an earlier prophecy of Joan's. At the timethat she wanted to take Paris and could have done it with ease if ourKing had but consented, she said that that was the golden time; that,with Paris ours, all France would be ours in six months. But if thisgolden opportunity to recover France was wasted, said she, "I give youtwenty years to do it in."
She was right. After Paris fell, in 1436, the rest of the work had to bedone city by city, castle by castle, and it took twenty years to finishit.
Yes, it was the first day of March, 1431, there in the court, that shestood in the view of everybody and uttered that strange and incredibleprediction. Now and then, in this world, somebody's prophecy turns upcorrect, but when you come to look into it there is sure to beconsiderable room for suspicion that the prophecy was made after thefact. But here the matter is different. There in that court Joan'sprophecy was set down in the official record at the hour and moment ofits utterance, years before the fulfilment, and there you may read it tothis day.
Twenty-five years after Joan's death the record was produced in the greatCourt of the Rehabilitation and verified under oath by Manchon and me,and surviving judges of our court confirmed the exactness of the recordin their testimony.
Joan' startling utterance on that now so celebrated first of Marchstirred up a great turmoil, and it was some time before it quieted downagain. Naturally, everybody was troubled, for a prophecy is a grisly andawful thing, whether one thinks it ascends from hell or comes down fromheaven.
All that these people felt sure of was, that the inspiration back of itwas genuine and puissant.
They would have given their right hands to know the source of it.
At last the questions began again.
"How do you know that those things are going to happen?"
"I know it by revelation. And I know it as surely as I know that you sithere before me."
This sort of answer was not going to allay the spreading uneasiness.Therefore, after some further dallying the judge got the subject out ofthe way and took up one which he could enjoy more.
"What languages do your Voices speak?"
"French."
"St. Marguerite, too?"
"Verily; why not? She is on our side, not on the English!"
Saints and angels who did not condescend to speak English is a graveaffront. They could not be brought into court and punished for contempt,but the tribunal could take silent note of Joan's remark and remember itagainst her; which they did. It might be useful by and by.
"Do your saints and angels wear jewelry?--crowns, rings, earrings?"
To Joan, questions like these were profane frivolities and not worthy ofserious notice; she answered indifferently. But the question brought toher mind another matter, and she turned upon Cauchon and said:
"I had two rings. They have been taken away from me during my captivity.You have one of them. It is the gift of my brother. Give it back to me.If not to me, then I pray that it be given to the Church."
The judges conceived the idea that maybe these rings were for the workingof enchantments.
Perhaps they could be made to do Joan a damage.
"Where is the other ring?"
"The Burgundians have it."
"Where did you get it?"
"My father and mother gave it to me."
"Describe it."
"It is plain and simple and has 'Jesus and Mary' engraved upon it."
Everybody could see that that was not a valuable equipment to do devil'swork with. So that trail was not worth following. Still, to make sure,one of the judges asked Joan if she had ever cured sick people bytouching them with the ring. She said no.
"Now as concerning the fairies, that were used to abide near by Domremywhereof there are many reports and traditions. It is said that yourgodmother surprised these creatures on a summer's night dancing under thetree called l'Arbre Fee de Bourlemont. Is it not possible that yourpretended saints and angles are but those fairies?"
"Is that in your proces?"
She made no other answer.
"Have you not conversed with St. Marguerite and St. Catherine under thattree?"
"I do not know."
"Or by the fountain near the tree?"
"Yes, sometimes."
"What promises did they make you?"
"None but such as they had God's warrant for."
"But what promises did they make?"
"That is not in your proces; yet I will say this much: they told me thatthe King would become master of his kingdom in spite of his enemies."
"And what else?"
There was a pause; then she said humbly:
"They promised to lead me to Paradise."
If faces do really betray what is passing in men's minds, a fear cameupon many in that house, at this time, that maybe, after all, a chosenservant and herald of God was here being hunted to her death. Theinterest deepened. Movements and whisperings ceased: the stillness becamealmost painful.
Have you noticed that almost from the beginning the nature of thequestions asked Joan showed that in some way or other the questioner veryoften already knew his fact before he asked his question? Have younoticed that somehow or other the questioners usually knew just how andwere to search for Joan's secrets; that they really knew the bulk of herprivacies--a fact not suspected by her--and that they had no task beforethem but to trick her into exposing those secrets?
Do you remember Loyseleur, the hypocrite, the treacherous priest, tool ofCauchon? Do you remember that under the sacred seal of the confessionalJoan freely and trustingly revealed to him everything concerning herhistory save only a few things regarding her supernatural revelationswhich her Voices had forbidden her to tell to any one--and that theunjust judge, Cauchon, was a hidden listener all the time?
Now you understand how the inquisitors were able to devise that longarray of minutely prying questions; questions whose subtlety andingenuity and penetration are astonishing until we come to rememberLoyseleur's performance and recognize their source. Ah, Bishop ofBeauvais, you are now lamenting this cruel iniquity these many years inhell! Yes verily, unless one has come to your help. There is but oneamong the redeemed that would do it; and it is futile to hope that thatone has not already done it--Joan of Arc.
We will return to the questionings.
"Did they make you still another promise?"
"Yes, but that is not in your proces. I will not tell it now, but beforethree months I will tell it you."
The judge seems to know the matter he is asking about, already; one getsthis idea from his next question.
"Did your Voices tell you that you would be liberated before threemonths?"
Joan often showed a little flash of surprise at the good guessing of thejudges, and she showed one this time. I was frequently in terror to findmy mind (which I could not control) criticizing the Voices and saying,"They counsel her to speak boldly--a thing which she would do without anysuggestion from them or anybody else--but when it comes to telling herany useful thing, such as how these conspirators manage to guess theirway so skilfully into her affairs, they are always off attending to someother business."
I am reverent by nature; and when such thoughts swept through my headthey made me cold with fear, and if there was a storm and thunder at thetime, I was so ill that I could but with difficulty abide at my post anddo my work.
Joan answered:
"That is not in your proces. I do not know when I shall be set free, butsome who wish me out of this world will go from it before me."
It made some of them shiver.
"Have your Voices told you that you will be delivered from this prison?"
Without a doubt they had, and the judge knew it before he asked thequestion.
"Ask me again in three months and I will tell you." She said it with sucha happy look, the tired prisoner! And I? And Noel Rainguesson, droopingyonder?--why, the floods of joy went streaming through us from crown tosole! It was all that we could do to hold still and keep from makingfatal exposure of our feelings.
She was to be set free in three months. That was what she meant; we sawit. The Voices had told her so, and told her true--true to the veryday--May 30th. But we know now that they had mercifully hidden from herhow she was to be set free, but left her in ignorance. Home again!
That day was our understanding of it--Noel's and mine; that was ourdream; and now we would count the days, the hours, the minutes. Theywould fly lightly along; they would soon be over.
Yes, we would carry our idol home; and there, far from the pomps andtumults of the world, we would take up our happy life again and live itout as we had begun it, in the free air and the sunshine, with thefriendly sheep and the friendly people for comrades, and the grace andcharm of the meadows, the woods, and the river always before our eyes andtheir deep peace in our hearts. Yes, that was our dream, the dream thatcarried us bravely through that three months to an exact and awfulfulfilment, the though of which would have killed us, I think, if we hadforeknown it and been obliged to bear the burden of it upon our heartsthe half of those weary days.
Our reading of the prophecy was this: We believed the King's soul wasgoing to be smitten with remorse; and that he would privately plan arescue with Joan's old lieutenants, D'Alencon and the Bastard and LaHire, and that this rescue would take place at the end of the threemonths. So we made up our minds to be ready and take a hand in it.
In the present and also in later sittings Joan was urged to name theexact day of her deliverance; but she could not do that. She had not thepermission of her Voices. Moreover, the Voices themselves did not namethe precise day. Ever since the fulfilment of the prophecy, I havebelieved that Joan had the idea that her deliverance was going to dome inthe form of death. But not that death! Divine as she was, dauntless asshe was in battle, she was human also. She was not solely a saint, anangel, she was a clay-made girl also--as human a girl as any in theworld, and full of a human girl's sensitiveness and tenderness anddelicacies. And so, that death! No, she could not have lived the threemonths with that one before her, I think. You remember that the firsttime she was wounded she was frightened, and cried, just as any othergirl of seventeen would have done, although she had known for eighteendays that she was going to be wounded on that very day. No, she was notafraid of any ordinary death, and an ordinary death was what she believedthe prophecy of deliverance meant, I think, for her face showedhappiness, not horror, when she uttered it.
Now I will explain why I think as I do. Five weeks before she wascaptured in the battle of Compiegne, her Voices told her what was coming.They did not tell her the day or the place, but said she would be takenprisoner and that it would be before the feast of St. John. She beggedthat death, certain and swift, should be her fate, and the captivitybrief; for she was a free spirit, and dreaded the confinement. The Voicesmade no promise, but only told her to bear whatever came. Now as they didnot refuse the swift death, a hopeful young thing like Joan wouldnaturally cherish that fact and make the most of it, allowing it to growand establish itself in her mind. And so now that she was told she was tobe "delivered" in three months, I think she believed it meant that shewould die in her bed in the prison, and that that was why she lookedhappy and content--the gates of Paradise standing open for her, the timeso short, you see, her troubles so soon to be over, her reward so closeat hand. Yes, that would make her look happy, that would make her patientand bold, and able to fight her fight out like a soldier. Save herself ifshe could, of course, and try for the best, for that was the way she wasmade; but die with her face to the front if die she must.
Then later, when she charged Cauchon with trying to kill her with apoisoned fish, her notion that she was to be "delivered" by death in theprison--if she had it, and I believe she had--would naturally be greatlystrengthened, you see.
But I am wandering from the trial. Joan was asked to definitely name thetime that she would be delivered from prison.
"I have always said that I was not permitted to tell you everything. I amto be set free, and I desire to ask leave of my Voices to tell you theday. That is why I wish for delay."
"Do your Voices forbid you to tell the truth?"
"Is it that you wish to know matters concerning the King of France? Itell you again that he will regain his kingdom, and that I know it aswell as I know that you sit here before me in this tribunal." She sighedand, after a little pause, added: "I should be dead but for thisrevelation, which comforts me always."
Some trivial questions were asked her about St. Michael's dress andappearance. She answered them with dignity, but one saw that they gaveher pain. After a little she said:
"I have great joy in seeing him, for when I see him I have the feelingthat I am not in mortal sin."
She added, "Sometimes St. Marguerite and St. Catherine have allowed me toconfess myself to them."
Here was a possible chance to set a successful snare for her innocence.
"When you confessed were you in mortal sin, do you think?"
But her reply did her no hurt. So the inquiry was shifted once more tothe revelations made to the King--secrets which the court had tried againand again to force out of Joan, but without success.
"Now as to the sign given to the King--"
"I have already told you that I will tell you nothing about it."
"Do you know what the sign was?"
"As to that, you will not find out from me."
All this refers to Joan's secret interview with the King--held apart,though two or three others were present. It was known--through Loyseleur,of course--that this sign was a crown and was a pledge of the verity ofJoan's mission. But that is all a mystery until this day--the nature ofthe crown, I mean--and will remain a mystery to the end of time. We cannever know whether a real crown descended upon the King's head, or only asymbol, the mystic fabric of a vision.
"Did you see a crown upon the King's head when he received therevelation?"
"I cannot tell you as to that, without perjury."
"Did the King have that crown at Rheims?"
"I think the King put upon his head a crown which he found there; but amuch richer one was brought him afterward."
"Have you seen that one?"
"I cannot tell you, without perjury. But whether I have seen it or not, Ihave heard say that it was rich and magnificent."
They went on and pestered her to weariness about that mysterious crown,but they got nothing more out of her. The sitting closed. A long, hardday for all of us.
