In the first place God made idiots. This was for practice. Then He madeSchool Boards. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

Suppose we applied no more ingenuity to the instruction of deaf and dumband blind children than we sometimes apply in our American public schoolsto the instruction of children who are in possession of all theirfaculties?  The result would be that the deaf and dumb and blind wouldacquire nothing.  They would live and die as ignorant as bricks andstones.  The methods used in the asylums are rational.  The teacherexactly measures the child's capacity, to begin with; and from thenceonwards the tasks imposed are nicely gauged to the gradual development ofthat capacity, the tasks keep pace with the steps of the child'sprogress, they don't jump miles and leagues ahead of it by irrationalcaprice and land in vacancy--according to the average public-school plan.In the public school, apparently, they teach the child to spell cat, thenask it to calculate an eclipse; when it can read words of two syllables,they require it to explain the circulation of the blood; when it reachesthe head of the infant class they bully it with conundrums that cover thedomain of universal knowledge.  This sounds extravagant--and is; yet itgoes no great way beyond the facts.
I received a curious letter one day, from the Punjab (you must pronounceit Punjawb).  The handwriting was excellent, and the wording was English--English, and yet not exactly English.  The style was easy and smoothand flowing, yet there was something subtly foreign about it--A somethingtropically ornate and sentimental and rhetorical.  It turned out to bethe work of a Hindoo youth, the holder of a humble clerical billet in arailway office.  He had been educated in one of the numerous colleges ofIndia.  Upon inquiry I was told that the country was full of youngfellows of his like.  They had been educated away up to the snow-summitsof learning--and the market for all this elaborate cultivation wasminutely out of proportion to the vastness of the product.  This marketconsisted of some thousands of small clerical posts under the government--the supply of material for it was multitudinous.  If this youth with theflowing style and the blossoming English was occupying a small railwayclerkship, it meant that there were hundreds and hundreds as capable ashe, or he would be in a high place; and it certainly meant that therewere thousands whose education and capacity had fallen a little short,and that they would have to go without places.  Apparently, then, thecolleges of India were doing what our high schools have long been doing--richly over-supplying the market for highly-educated service; and therebydoing a damage to the scholar, and through him to the country.
At home I once made a speech deploring the injuries inflicted by the highschool in making handicrafts distasteful to boys who would have beenwilling to make a living at trades and agriculture if they had but hadthe good luck to stop with the common school.  But I made no converts.Not one, in a community overrun with educated idlers who were abovefollowing their fathers' mechanical trades, yet could find no market fortheir book-knowledge.  The same rail that brought me the letter from thePunjab, brought also a little book published by Messrs. Thacker, Spink &Co., of Calcutta, which interested me, for both its preface and itscontents treated of this matter of over-education.  In the preface occursthis paragraph from the Calcutta Review.  For "Government office" read"drygoods clerkship" and it will fit more than one region of America:
     "The education that we give makes the boys a little less clownish in     their manners, and more intelligent when spoken to by strangers.  On     the other hand, it has made them less contented with their lot in     life, and less willing to work with their hands.  The form which     discontent takes in this country is not of a healthy kind; for, the     Natives of India consider that the only occupation worthy of an     educated man is that of a writership in some office, and especially     in a Government office.  The village schoolboy goes back to the plow     with the greatest reluctance; and the town schoolboy carries the     same discontent and inefficiency into his father's workshop.     Sometimes these ex-students positively refuse at first to work; and     more than once parents have openly expressed their regret that they     ever allowed their sons to be inveigled to school."
The little book which I am quoting from is called "Indo-AnglianLiterature," and is well stocked with "baboo" English--clerkly English,hooky English, acquired in the schools.  Some of it is very funny,--almost as funny, perhaps, as what you and I produce when we try to writein a language not our own; but much of it is surprisingly correct andfree.  If I were going to quote good English--but I am not.  India iswell stocked with natives who speak it and write it as well as the bestof us.  I merely wish to show some of the quaint imperfect attempts atthe use of our tongue.  There are many letters in the book; povertyimploring help--bread, money, kindness, office generally an office, aclerkship, some way to get food and a rag out of the applicant'sunmarketable education; and food not for himself alone, but sometimes fora dozen helpless relations in addition to his own family; for thosepeople are astonishingly unselfish, and admirably faithful to their tiesof kinship.  Among us I think there is nothing approaching it.  Strangeas some of these wailing and supplicating letters are, humble and evengroveling as some of them are, and quaintly funny and confused as agoodly number of them are, there is still a pathos about them, as a rule,that checks the rising laugh and reproaches it.  In the following letter"father" is not to be read literally.  In Ceylon a little nativebeggar-girl embarrassed me by calling me father, although I knew she wasmistaken.  I was so new that I did not know that she was merely followingthe custom of the dependent and the supplicant.
     "SIR,
     "I pray please to give me some action (work) for I am very poor boy     I have no one to help me even so father for it so it seemed in thy     good sight, you give the Telegraph Office, and another work what is     your wish I am very poor boy, this understand what is your wish you     my father I am your son this understand what is your wish.
     "Your Sirvent, P. C. B."
Through ages of debasing oppression suffered by these people at the handsof their native rulers, they come legitimately by the attitude andlanguage of fawning and flattery, and one must remember this inmitigation when passing judgment upon the native character.  It is commonin these letters to find the petitioner furtively trying to get at thewhite man's soft religious side; even this poor boy baits his hook with amacerated Bible-text in the hope that it may catch something if all elsefail.
Here is an application for the post of instructor in English to somechildren:
     "My Dear Sir or Gentleman, that your Petitioner has much     qualification in the Language of English to instruct the young boys;     I was given to understand that your of suitable children has to     acquire the knowledge of English language."
As a sample of the flowery Eastern style, I will take a sentence or twofrom along letter written by a young native to the Lieutenant-Governor ofBengal--an application for employment:
     "HONORED AND MUCH RESPECTED SIR,
     "I hope your honor will condescend to hear the tale of this poor     creature.  I shall overflow with gratitude at this mark of your     royal condescension.  The bird-like happiness has flown away from my     nest-like heart and has not hitherto returned from the period whence     the rose of my father's life suffered the autumnal breath of death,     in plain English he passed through the gates of Grave, and from that     hour the phantom of delight has never danced before me."
It is all school-English, book-English, you see; and good enough, too,all things considered.  If the native boy had but that one study he wouldshine, he would dazzle, no doubt.  But that is not the case.  He issituated as are our public-school children--loaded down with anover-freightage of other studies; and frequently they are as far beyondthe actual point of progress reached by him and suited to the stage ofdevelopment attained, as could be imagined by the insanest fancy.Apparently--like our public-school boy--he must work, work, work, inschool and out, and play but little.  Apparently--like our public-schoolboy--his "education" consists in learning things, not the meaning ofthem; he is fed upon the husks, not the corn.  From several essayswritten by native schoolboys in answer to the question of how they spendtheir day, I select one--the one which goes most into detail:
     "66.  At the break of day I rises from my own bed and finish my     daily duty, then I employ myself till 8 o'clock, after which I     employ myself to bathe, then take for my body some sweet meat, and     just at 9 1/2 I came to school to attend my class duty, then at     2 1/2 P. M.  I return from school and engage myself to do my natural     duty, then, I engage for a quarter to take my tithn, then I study     till 5 P. M., after which I began to play anything which comes in     my head.  After 8 1/2, half pass to eight we are began to sleep,     before sleeping I told a constable just 11 o' he came and rose us     from half pass eleven we began to read still morning."
It is not perfectly clear, now that I come to cipher upon it.  He gets upat about 5 in the morning, or along there somewhere, and goes to bedabout fifteen or sixteen hours afterward--that much of it seems straight;but why he should rise again three hours later and resume his studiestill morning is puzzling.
I think it is because he is studying history.  History requires a worldof time and bitter hard work when your "education" is no further advancedthan the cat's; when you are merely stuffing yourself with a mixed-upmess of empty names and random incidents and elusive dates, which no oneteaches you how to interpret, and which, uninterpreted, pay you not afarthing's value for your waste of time.  Yes, I think he had to get upat halfpast 11 P.M.  in order to be sure to be perfect with his historylesson by noon.  With results as follows--from a Calcutta schoolexamination:
"Q.  Who was Cardinal Wolsey?
"Cardinal Wolsey was an Editor of a paper named North Briton.  No. 45 ofhis publication he charged the King of uttering a lie from the throne.He was arrested and cast into prison; and after releasing went to France.
"3.  As Bishop of York but died in disentry in a church on his way to beblockheaded.
"8.  Cardinal Wolsey was the son of Edward IV, after his father's deathhe himself ascended the throne at the age of (10) ten only, but when hesurpassed or when he was fallen in his twenty years of age at that timehe wished to make a journey in his countries under him, but he wasopposed by his mother to do journey, and according to his mother'sexample he remained in the home, and then became King.  After many timesobstacles and many confusion he become King and afterwards his brother."
There is probably not a word of truth in that.
"Q.  What is the meaning of 'Ich Dien'?
"10.  An honor conferred on the first or eldest sons of EnglishSovereigns.  It is nothing more than some feathers.
"11.  Ich Dien was the word which was written on the feathers of theblind King who came to fight, being interlaced with the bridles of thehorse.
"13.  Ich Dien is a title given to Henry VII by the Pope of Rome, when heforwarded the Reformation of Cardinal Wolsy to Rome, and for this reasonhe was called Commander of the faith."
A dozen or so of this kind of insane answers are quoted in the book fromthat examination.  Each answer is sweeping proof, all by itself, that theperson uttering it was pushed ahead of where he belonged when he was putinto history; proof that he had been put to the task of acquiring historybefore he had had a single lesson in the art of acquiring it, which isthe equivalent of dumping a pupil into geometry before he has learned theprogressive steps which lead up to it and make its acquirement possible.Those Calcutta novices had no business with history.  There was no excusefor examining them in it, no excuse for exposing them and their teachers.They were totally empty; there was nothing to "examine."
Helen Keller has been dumb, stone deaf, and stone blind, ever since shewas a little baby a year-and-a-half old; and now at sixteen years of agethis miraculous creature, this wonder of all the ages, passes the HarvardUniversity examination in Latin, German, French history, belles lettres,and such things, and does it brilliantly, too, not in a commonplacefashion.  She doesn't know merely things, she is splendidly familiar withthe meanings of them.  When she writes an essay on a Shakespeareancharacter, her English is fine and strong, her grasp of the subject isthe grasp of one who knows, and her page is electric with light.  HasMiss Sullivan taught her by the methods of India and the American publicschool?  No, oh, no; for then she would be deafer and dumber and blinderthan she was before.  It is a pity that we can't educate all the childrenin the asylums.
To continue the Calcutta exposure:
"What is the meaning of a Sheriff?"
"25.  Sheriff is a post opened in the time of John.  The duty of Sheriffhere in Calcutta, to look out and catch those carriages which is rashlydriven out by the coachman; but it is a high post in England.
"26.  Sheriff was the English bill of common prayer.
"27.  The man with whom the accusative persons are placed is calledSheriff.
"28.  Sheriff--Latin term for 'shrub,' we called broom, worn by the firstearl of Enjue, as an emblem of humility when they went to the pilgrimage,and from this their hairs took their crest and surname.
"29.  Sheriff is a kind of titlous sect of people, as Barons, Nobles,etc.
"30.  Sheriff; a tittle given on those persons who were respective andpious in England."
The students were examined in the following bulky matters: Geometry, theSolar Spectrum, the Habeas Corpus Act, the British Parliament, and inMetaphysics they were asked to trace the progress of skepticism fromDescartes to Hume.  It is within bounds to say that some of the resultswere astonishing.  Without doubt, there were students present whojustified their teacher's wisdom in introducing them to these studies;but the fact is also evident that others had been pushed into thesestudies to waste their time over them when they could have beenprofitably employed in hunting smaller game.  Under the head of Geometry,one of the answers is this:
"49.  The whole BD = the whole CA, and so-so-so-so-so-so-so."
To me this is cloudy, but I was never well up in geometry.  That was theonly effort made among the five students who appeared for examination ingeometry; the other four wailed and surrendered without a fight.  Theyare piteous wails, too, wails of despair; and one of them is an eloquentreproach; it comes from a poor fellow who has been laden beyond hisstrength by a stupid teacher, and is eloquent in spite of the poverty ofits English.  The poor chap finds himself required to explain riddleswhich even Sir Isaac Newton was not able to understand:
"50.  Oh my dear father examiner you my father and you kindly give anumber of pass you my great father.
"51.  I am a poor boy and have no means to support my mother and twobrothers who are suffering much for want of food.  I get four rupeesmonthly from charity fund of this place, from which I send two rupees fortheir support, and keep two for my own support.  Father, if I relate theunlucky circumstance under which we are placed, then, I think, you willnot be able to suppress the tender tear.
"52.  Sir which Sir Isaac Newton and other experienced mathematicianscannot understand I being third of Entrance Class can understand thesewhich is too impossible to imagine.  And my examiner also has put verytiresome and very heavy propositions to prove."
We must remember that these pupils had to do their thinking in onelanguage, and express themselves in another and alien one.  It was aheavy handicap.  I have by me "English as She is Taught"--a collection ofAmerican examinations made in the public schools of Brooklyn by one ofthe teachers, Miss Caroline B. Le Row.  An extract or two from its pageswill show that when the American pupil is using but one language, andthat one his own, his performance is no whit better than his Indianbrother's:
"ON HISTORY.
"Christopher Columbus was called the father of his Country.  QueenIsabella of Spain sold her watch and chain and other millinery so thatColumbus could discover America.
"The Indian wars were very desecrating to the country.
"The Indians pursued their warfare by hiding in the bushes and thenscalping them.
"Captain John Smith has been styled the father of his country.  His lifewas saved by his daughter Pochahantas.
"The Puritans found an insane asylum in the wilds of America.
"The Stamp Act was to make everybody stamp all materials so they shouldbe null and void.
"Washington died in Spain almost broken-hearted.  His remains were takento the cathedral in Havana.
"Gorilla warfare was where men rode on gorillas."
In Brooklyn, as in India, they examine a pupil, and when they find out hedoesn't know anything, they put him into literature, or geometry, orastronomy, or government, or something like that, so that he can properlydisplay the assification of the whole system--
"ON LITERATURE.
"'Bracebridge Hall' was written by Henry Irving.
"Edgar A. Poe was a very curdling writer.
"Beowulf wrote the Scriptures.
"Ben Johnson survived Shakespeare in some respects.
"In the 'Canterbury Tale' it gives account of King Alfred on his way tothe shrine of Thomas Bucket.
"Chaucer was the father of English pottery.
"Chaucer was succeeded by H. Wads. Longfellow."
We will finish with a couple of samples of "literature," one fromAmerica, the other from India.  The first is a Brooklyn public-schoolboy's attempt to turn a few verses of the "Lady of the Lake" into prose.You will have to concede that he did it:
"The man who rode on the horse performed the whip and an instrument madeof steel alone with strong ardor not diminishing, for, being tired fromthe time passed with hard labor overworked with anger and ignorant withweariness, while every breath for labor lie drew with cries full ofsorrow, the young deer made imperfect who worked hard filtered in sight."
The following paragraph is from a little book which is famous in India--the biography of a distinguished Hindoo judge, Onoocool ChunderMookerjee; it was written by his nephew, and is unintentionally funny-infact, exceedingly so.  I offer here the closing scene.  If you would liketo sample the rest of the book, it can be had by applying to thepublishers, Messrs.  Thacker, Spink & Co., Calcutta
     "And having said these words he hermetically sealed his lips not to     open them again.  All the well-known doctors of Calcutta that could     be procured for a man of his position and wealth were brought,     --Doctors Payne, Fayrer, and Nilmadhub Mookerjee and others; they did     what they could do, with their puissance and knack of medical     knowledge, but it proved after all as if to milk the ram!  His wife     and children had not the mournful consolation to hear his last     words; he remained sotto voce for a few hours, and then was taken     from us at 6.12 P.m.  according to the caprice of God which passeth     understanding."
