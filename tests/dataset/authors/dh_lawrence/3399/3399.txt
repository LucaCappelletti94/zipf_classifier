  Yesterday the fields were only grey with scattered snow,	And now the longest grass-leaves hardly emerge;	Yet her deep footsteps mark the snow, and go	On towards the pines at the hills' white verge.	 I cannot see her, since the mist's white scarf Obscures the dark wood and the dull orange sky;	But she's waiting, I know, impatient and cold, half	Sobs struggling into her frosty sigh.	 Why does she come so promptly, when she must know	That she's only the nearer to the inevitable farewell; The hill is steep, on the snow my steps are slow--	Why does she come, when she knows what I have to tell?
