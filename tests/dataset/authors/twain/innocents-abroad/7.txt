A week of buffeting a tempestuous and relentless sea; a week ofseasickness and deserted cabins; of lonely quarterdecks drenched withspray--spray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick witha white crust of salt to their very tops; a week of shivering in theshelter of the lifeboats and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating"clouds" and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room atnight.
And the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all. There was nothunder, no noise but the pounding bows of the ship, the keen whistlingof the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters.But the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven--then pausedan instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again, as froma precipice. The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain. Theblackness of darkness was everywhere. At long intervals a flash oflightning clove it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heavingworld of water where was nothing before, kindled the dusky cordage toglittering silver, and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster!
Fear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds andthe spray. Some thought the vessel could not live through the night, andit seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest andsee the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchralcabins, under the dim lamps, and imagine the horrors that were abroad onthe ocean. And once out--once where they could see the ship strugglingin the strong grasp of the storm--once where they could hear the shriekof the winds and face the driving spray and look out upon the majesticpicture the lightnings disclosed, they were prisoners to a fiercefascination they could not resist, and so remained. It was a wild night--and a very, very long one.
Everybody was sent scampering to the deck at seven o'clock this lovelymorning of the thirtieth of June with the glad news that land was insight! It was a rare thing and a joyful, to see all the ship's familyabroad once more, albeit the happiness that sat upon every countenancecould only partly conceal the ravages which that long siege of storms hadwrought there. But dull eyes soon sparkled with pleasure, pallid cheeksflushed again, and frames weakened by sickness gathered new life from thequickening influences of the bright, fresh morning. Yea, and from astill more potent influence: the worn castaways were to see the blessedland again!--and to see it was to bring back that motherland that was inall their thoughts.
Within the hour we were fairly within the Straits of Gibraltar, the tallyellow-splotched hills of Africa on our right, with their bases veiled ina blue haze and their summits swathed in clouds--the same being accordingto Scripture, which says that "clouds and darkness are over the land."The words were spoken of this particular portion of Africa, I believe.On our left were the granite-ribbed domes of old Spain. The strait isonly thirteen miles wide in its narrowest part.
At short intervals along the Spanish shore were quaint-looking old stonetowers--Moorish, we thought--but learned better afterwards. In formertimes the Morocco rascals used to coast along the Spanish Main in theirboats till a safe opportunity seemed to present itself, and then dart inand capture a Spanish village and carry off all the pretty women theycould find. It was a pleasant business, and was very popular. TheSpaniards built these watchtowers on the hills to enable them to keep asharper lookout on the Moroccan speculators.
The picture on the other hand was very beautiful to eyes weary of thechangeless sea, and by and by the ship's company grew wonderfullycheerful. But while we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and thelowlands robed in misty gloom a finer picture burst upon us and chainedevery eye like a magnet--a stately ship, with canvas piled on canvas tillshe was one towering mass of bellying sail! She came speeding over thesea like a great bird. Africa and Spain were forgotten. All homage wasfor the beautiful stranger. While everybody gazed she swept superbly byand flung the Stars and Stripes to the breeze! Quicker than thought,hats and handkerchiefs flashed in the air, and a cheer went up! She wasbeautiful before--she was radiant now. Many a one on our decks knew thenfor the first time how tame a sight his country's flag is at homecompared to what it is in a foreign land. To see it is to see a visionof home itself and all its idols, and feel a thrill that would stir avery river of sluggish blood!
We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and already theAfrican one, "Ape's Hill," a grand old mountain with summit streaked withgranite ledges, was in sight. The other, the great Rock of Gibraltar,was yet to come. The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules thehead of navigation and the end of the world. The information theancients didn't have was very voluminous. Even the prophets wrote bookafter book and epistle after epistle, yet never once hinted at theexistence of a great continent on our side of the water; yet they musthave known it was there, I should think.
In a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing seeminglyin the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides bythe sea, swung magnificently into view, and we needed no tedious traveledparrot to tell us it was Gibraltar. There could not be two rocks likethat in one kingdom.
The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long, I should say, by1,400 to 1,500 feet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at its base. Oneside and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as theside of a house, the other end is irregular and the other side is a steepslant which an army would find very difficult to climb. At the foot ofthis slant is the walled town of Gibraltar--or rather the town occupiespart of the slant. Everywhere--on hillside, in the precipice, by thesea, on the heights--everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is cladwith masonry and bristling with guns. It makes a striking and livelypicture from whatsoever point you contemplate it. It is pushed out intothe sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, and is suggestive ofa "gob" of mud on the end of a shingle. A few hundred yards of this flatground at its base belongs to the English, and then, extending across thestrip from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a distance of a quarter ofa mile, comes the "Neutral Ground," a space two or three hundred yardswide, which is free to both parties.
"Are you going through Spain to Paris?" That question was bandied aboutthe ship day and night from Fayal to Gibraltar, and I thought I nevercould get so tired of hearing any one combination of words again or moretired of answering, "I don't know." At the last moment six or seven hadsufficient decision of character to make up their minds to go, and didgo, and I felt a sense of relief at once--it was forever too late now andI could make up my mind at my leisure not to go. I must have aprodigious quantity of mind; it takes me as much as a week sometimes tomake it up.
But behold how annoyances repeat themselves. We had no sooner gotten ridof the Spain distress than the Gibraltar guides started another--atiresome repetition of a legend that had nothing very astonishing aboutit, even in the first place: "That high hill yonder is called the Queen'sChair; it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair therewhen the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar, and said shewould never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from thefortresses. If the English hadn't been gallant enough to lower the flagfor a few hours one day, she'd have had to break her oath or die upthere."
We rode on asses and mules up the steep, narrow streets and entered thesubterranean galleries the English have blasted out in the rock. Thesegalleries are like spacious railway tunnels, and at short intervals inthem great guns frown out upon sea and town through portholes five or sixhundred feet above the ocean. There is a mile or so of this subterraneanwork, and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor. The galleryguns command the peninsula and the harbors of both oceans, but they mightas well not be there, I should think, for an army could hardly climb theperpendicular wall of the rock anyhow. Those lofty portholes affordsuperb views of the sea, though. At one place, where a jutting crag washollowed out into a great chamber whose furniture was huge cannon andwhose windows were portholes, a glimpse was caught of a hill not faraway, and a soldier said:
"That high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair; it is because a queenof Spain placed her chair there once when the French and Spanish troopswere besieging Gibraltar, and said she would never move from the spottill the English flag was lowered from the fortresses. If the Englishhadn't been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day,she'd have had to break her oath or die up there."
On the topmost pinnacle of Gibraltar we halted a good while, and no doubtthe mules were tired. They had a right to be. The military road wasgood, but rather steep, and there was a good deal of it. The view fromthe narrow ledge was magnificent; from it vessels seeming like thetiniest little toy boats were turned into noble ships by the telescopes,and other vessels that were fifty miles away and even sixty, they said,and invisible to the naked eye, could be clearly distinguished throughthose same telescopes. Below, on one side, we looked down upon anendless mass of batteries and on the other straight down to the sea.
While I was resting ever so comfortably on a rampart, and cooling mybaking head in the delicious breeze, an officious guide belonging toanother party came up and said:
"Senor, that high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair--"
"Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land. Have pity on me. Don't--now don't inflict that most in-FERNAL old legend on me anymore today!"
There--I had used strong language after promising I would never do soagain; but the provocation was more than human nature could bear. If youhad been bored so, when you had the noble panorama of Spain and Africaand the blue Mediterranean spread abroad at your feet, and wanted to gazeand enjoy and surfeit yourself in its beauty in silence, you might haveeven burst into stronger language than I did.
Gibraltar has stood several protracted sieges, one of them of nearly fouryears' duration (it failed), and the English only captured it bystratagem. The wonder is that anybody should ever dream of trying soimpossible a project as the taking it by assault--and yet it has beentried more than once.
The Moors held the place twelve hundred years ago, and a staunch oldcastle of theirs of that date still frowns from the middle of the town,with moss-grown battlements and sides well scarred by shots fired inbattles and sieges that are forgotten now. A secret chamber in the rockbehind it was discovered some time ago, which contained a sword ofexquisite workmanship, and some quaint old armor of a fashion thatantiquaries are not acquainted with, though it is supposed to be Roman.Roman armor and Roman relics of various kinds have been found in a cavein the sea extremity of Gibraltar; history says Rome held this part ofthe country about the Christian era, and these things seem to confirm thestatement.
In that cave also are found human bones, crusted with a very thick, stonycoating, and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only livedbefore the flood, but as much as ten thousand years before it. It may betrue--it looks reasonable enough--but as long as those parties can't voteanymore, the matter can be of no great public interest. In this cavelikewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist in everypart of Africa, yet within memory and tradition have never existed in anyportion of Spain save this lone peak of Gibraltar! So the theory is thatthe channel between Gibraltar and Africa was once dry land, and that thelow, neutral neck between Gibraltar and the Spanish hills behind it wasonce ocean, and of course that these African animals, being over atGibraltar (after rock, perhaps--there is plenty there), got closed outwhen the great change occurred. The hills in Africa, across the channel,are full of apes, and there are now and always have been apes on the rockof Gibraltar--but not elsewhere in Spain! The subject is an interestingone.
There is an English garrison at Gibraltar of 6,000 or 7,000 men, and souniforms of flaming red are plenty; and red and blue, and undresscostumes of snowy white, and also the queer uniform of the bare-kneedHighlander; and one sees soft-eyed Spanish girls from San Roque, andveiled Moorish beauties (I suppose they are beauties) from Tarifa, andturbaned, sashed, and trousered Moorish merchants from Fez, andlong-robed, bare-legged, ragged Muhammadan vagabonds from Tetuan andTangier, some brown, some yellow and some as black as virgin ink--andJews from all around, in gabardine, skullcap, and slippers, just as theyare in pictures and theaters, and just as they were three thousand yearsago, no doubt. You can easily understand that a tribe (somehow ourpilgrims suggest that expression, because they march in a stragglingprocession through these foreign places with such an Indian-like air ofcomplacency and independence about them) like ours, made up from fifteenor sixteen states of the Union, found enough to stare at in thisshifting panorama of fashion today.
Speaking of our pilgrims reminds me that we have one or two people amongus who are sometimes an annoyance. However, I do not count the Oracle inthat list. I will explain that the Oracle is an innocent old ass whoeats for four and looks wiser than the whole Academy of France would haveany right to look, and never uses a one-syllable word when he can thinkof a longer one, and never by any possible chance knows the meaning ofany long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place; yet he willserenely venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it upcomplacently with quotations from authors who never existed, and finallywhen cornered will slide to the other side of the question, say he hasbeen there all the time, and come back at you with your own spokenarguments, only with the big words all tangled, and play them in yourvery teeth as original with himself. He reads a chapter in theguidebooks, mixes the facts all up, with his bad memory, and then goesoff to inflict the whole mess on somebody as wisdom which has beenfestering in his brain for years and which he gathered in college fromerudite authors who are dead now and out of print. This morning atbreakfast he pointed out of the window and said:
"Do you see that there hill out there on that African coast? It's one ofthem Pillows of Herkewls, I should say--and there's the ultimate onealongside of it."
"The ultimate one--that is a good word--but the pillars are not both onthe same side of the strait." (I saw he had been deceived by acarelessly written sentence in the guidebook.)
"Well, it ain't for you to say, nor for me. Some authors states it thatway, and some states it different. Old Gibbons don't say nothing aboutit--just shirks it complete--Gibbons always done that when he got stuck--but there is Rolampton, what does he say? Why, he says that they wasboth on the same side, and Trinculian, and Sobaster, and Syraccus, andLangomarganbl----"
"Oh, that will do--that's enough. If you have got your hand in forinventing authors and testimony, I have nothing more to say--let them beon the same side."
We don't mind the Oracle. We rather like him. We can tolerate theOracle very easily, but we have a poet and a good-natured enterprisingidiot on board, and they do distress the company. The one gives copiesof his verses to consuls, commanders, hotel keepers, Arabs, Dutch--toanybody, in fact, who will submit to a grievous infliction most kindlymeant. His poetry is all very well on shipboard, notwithstanding when hewrote an "Ode to the Ocean in a Storm" in one half hour, and an"Apostrophe to the Rooster in the Waist of the Ship" in the next, thetransition was considered to be rather abrupt; but when he sends aninvoice of rhymes to the Governor of Fayal and another to the commanderin chief and other dignitaries in Gibraltar with the compliments of theLaureate of the Ship, it is not popular with the passengers.
The other personage I have mentioned is young and green, and not bright,not learned, and not wise. He will be, though, someday if he recollectsthe answers to all his questions. He is known about the ship as the"Interrogation Point," and this by constant use has become shortened to"Interrogation." He has distinguished himself twice already. In Fayalthey pointed out a hill and told him it was 800 feet high and 1,100 feetlong. And they told him there was a tunnel 2,000 feet long and 1,000feet high running through the hill, from end to end. He believed it. Herepeated it to everybody, discussed it, and read it from his notes.Finally, he took a useful hint from this remark, which a thoughtful oldpilgrim made:
"Well, yes, it is a little remarkable--singular tunnel altogether--standsup out of the top of the hill about two hundred feet, and one end of itsticks out of the hill about nine hundred!"
Here in Gibraltar he corners these educated British officers and badgersthem with braggadocio about America and the wonders she can perform! Hetold one of them a couple of our gunboats could come here and knockGibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea!
At this present moment half a dozen of us are taking a private pleasureexcursion of our own devising. We form rather more than half the list ofwhite passengers on board a small steamer bound for the venerable Moorishtown of Tangier, Africa. Nothing could be more absolutely certain thanthat we are enjoying ourselves. One can not do otherwise who speeds overthese sparkling waters and breathes the soft atmosphere of this sunnyland. Care cannot assail us here. We are out of its jurisdiction.
We even steamed recklessly by the frowning fortress of Malabat(a stronghold of the Emperor of Morocco) without a twinge of fear.The whole garrison turned out under arms and assumed a threateningattitude--yet still we did not fear. The entire garrison marched andcounter-marched within the rampart, in full view--yet notwithstandingeven this, we never flinched.
I suppose we really do not know what fear is. I inquired the name of thegarrison of the fortress of Malabat, and they said it was Mehemet Ali BenSancom. I said it would be a good idea to get some more garrisons tohelp him; but they said no, he had nothing to do but hold the place, andhe was competent to do that, had done it two years already. That wasevidence which one could not well refute. There is nothing likereputation.
Every now and then my glove purchase in Gibraltar last night intrudesitself upon me. Dan and the ship's surgeon and I had been up to thegreat square, listening to the music of the fine military bands andcontemplating English and Spanish female loveliness and fashion, and atnine o'clock were on our way to the theater, when we met the General, theJudge, the Commodore, the Colonel, and the Commissioner of the UnitedStates of America to Europe, Asia, and Africa, who had been to the ClubHouse to register their several titles and impoverish the bill of fare;and they told us to go over to the little variety store near the Hall ofJustice and buy some kid gloves. They said they were elegant and verymoderate in price. It seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kidgloves, and we acted upon the hint. A very handsome young lady in thestore offered me a pair of blue gloves. I did not want blue, but shesaid they would look very pretty on a hand like mine. The remark touchedme tenderly. I glanced furtively at my hand, and somehow it did seemrather a comely member. I tried a glove on my left and blushed a little.Manifestly the size was too small for me. But I felt gratified when shesaid:
"Oh, it is just right!" Yet I knew it was no such thing.
I tugged at it diligently, but it was discouraging work. She said:
"Ah! I see you are accustomed to wearing kid gloves--but some gentlemenare so awkward about putting them on."
It was the last compliment I had expected. I only understand putting onthe buckskin article perfectly. I made another effort and tore the glovefrom the base of the thumb into the palm of the hand--and tried to hidethe rent. She kept up her compliments, and I kept up my determination todeserve them or die:
"Ah, you have had experience! [A rip down the back of the hand.] Theyare just right for you--your hand is very small--if they tear you neednot pay for them. [A rent across the middle.] I can always tell when agentleman understands putting on kid gloves. There is a grace about itthat only comes with long practice." The whole after-guard of the glove"fetched away," as the sailors say, the fabric parted across theknuckles, and nothing was left but a melancholy ruin.
I was too much flattered to make an exposure and throw the merchandise onthe angel's hands. I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; but Ihated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in theproceedings. I wished they were in Jericho. I felt exquisitely meanwhen I said cheerfully:
"This one does very well; it fits elegantly. I like a glove that fits.No, never mind, ma'am, never mind; I'll put the other on in the street.It is warm here."
It was warm. It was the warmest place I ever was in. I paid the bill,and as I passed out with a fascinating bow I thought I detected a lightin the woman's eye that was gently ironical; and when I looked back fromthe street, and she was laughing all to herself about something or other,I said to myself with withering sarcasm, "Oh, certainly; you know how toput on kid gloves, don't you? A self-complacent ass, ready to beflattered out of your senses by every petticoat that chooses to take thetrouble to do it!"
The silence of the boys annoyed me. Finally Dan said musingly:
"Some gentlemen don't know how to put on kid gloves at all, but some do."
And the doctor said (to the moon, I thought):
"But it is always easy to tell when a gentleman is used to putting on kidgloves."
Dan soliloquized after a pause:
"Ah, yes; there is a grace about it that only comes with long, very longpractice."
"Yes, indeed, I've noticed that when a man hauls on a kid glove like hewas dragging a cat out of an ash hole by the tail, he understands puttingon kid gloves; he's had ex--"
"Boys, enough of a thing's enough! You think you are very smart, Isuppose, but I don't. And if you go and tell any of those old gossips inthe ship about this thing, I'll never forgive you for it; that's all."
They let me alone then for the time being. We always let each otheralone in time to prevent ill feeling from spoiling a joke. But they hadbought gloves, too, as I did. We threw all the purchases away togetherthis morning. They were coarse, unsubstantial, freckled all over withbroad yellow splotches, and could neither stand wear nor publicexhibition. We had entertained an angel unawares, but we did not takeher in. She did that for us.
Tangier! A tribe of stalwart Moors are wading into the sea to carry usashore on their backs from the small boats.
