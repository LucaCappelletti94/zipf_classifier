We had a pleasant journey of it seaward again. We found that for thethree past nights our ship had been in a state of war. The first nightthe sailors of a British ship, being happy with grog, came down on thepier and challenged our sailors to a free fight. They accepted withalacrity, repaired to the pier, and gained--their share of a drawnbattle. Several bruised and bloody members of both parties were carriedoff by the police and imprisoned until the following morning. The nextnight the British boys came again to renew the fight, but our men had hadstrict orders to remain on board and out of sight. They did so, and thebesieging party grew noisy and more and more abusive as the fact becameapparent (to them) that our men were afraid to come out. They went awayfinally with a closing burst of ridicule and offensive epithets. Thethird night they came again and were more obstreperous than ever. Theyswaggered up and down the almost deserted pier, and hurled curses,obscenity, and stinging sarcasms at our crew. It was more than humannature could bear. The executive officer ordered our men ashore--withinstructions not to fight. They charged the British and gained abrilliant victory. I probably would not have mentioned this war had itended differently. But I travel to learn, and I still remember that theypicture no French defeats in the battle-galleries of Versailles.
It was like home to us to step on board the comfortable ship again andsmoke and lounge about her breezy decks. And yet it was not altogetherlike home, either, because so many members of the family were away. Wemissed some pleasant faces which we would rather have found at dinner,and at night there were gaps in the euchre-parties which could not besatisfactorily filled. "Moult" was in England, Jack in Switzerland,Charley in Spain. Blucher was gone, none could tell where. But we wereat sea again, and we had the stars and the ocean to look at, and plentyof room to meditate in.
In due time the shores of Italy were sighted, and as we stood gazing fromthe decks, early in the bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoarose up out of the sea and flung back the sunlight from her hundredpalaces.
Here we rest for the present--or rather, here we have been trying torest, for some little time, but we run about too much to accomplish agreat deal in that line.
I would like to remain here. I had rather not go any further. There maybe prettier women in Europe, but I doubt it. The population of Genoa is120,000; two-thirds of these are women, I think, and at least two-thirdsof the women are beautiful. They are as dressy and as tasteful and asgraceful as they could possibly be without being angels. However, angelsare not very dressy, I believe. At least the angels in pictures are not--they wear nothing but wings. But these Genoese women do look socharming. Most of the young demoiselles are robed in a cloud of whitefrom head to foot, though many trick themselves out more elaborately.Nine-tenths of them wear nothing on their heads but a filmy sort of veil,which falls down their backs like a white mist. They are very fair, andmany of them have blue eyes, but black and dreamy dark brown ones are metwith oftenest.
The ladies and gentlemen of Genoa have a pleasant fashion of promenadingin a large park on the top of a hill in the center of the city, from sixtill nine in the evening, and then eating ices in a neighboring garden anhour or two longer. We went to the park on Sunday evening. Two thousandpersons were present, chiefly young ladies and gentlemen. The gentlemenwere dressed in the very latest Paris fashions, and the robes of theladies glinted among the trees like so many snowflakes. The multitudemoved round and round the park in a great procession. The bands played,and so did the fountains; the moon and the gas lamps lit up the scene,and altogether it was a brilliant and an animated picture. I scannedevery female face that passed, and it seemed to me that all werehandsome. I never saw such a freshet of loveliness before. I did notsee how a man of only ordinary decision of character could marry here,because before he could get his mind made up he would fall in love withsomebody else.
Never smoke any Italian tobacco. Never do it on any account. It makesme shudder to think what it must be made of. You cannot throw an oldcigar "stub" down anywhere, but some vagabond will pounce upon it on theinstant. I like to smoke a good deal, but it wounds my sensibilities tosee one of these stub-hunters watching me out of the corners of hishungry eyes and calculating how long my cigar will be likely to last.It reminded me too painfully of that San Francisco undertaker who used togo to sick-beds with his watch in his hand and time the corpse. One ofthese stub-hunters followed us all over the park last night, and we neverhad a smoke that was worth anything. We were always moved to appease himwith the stub before the cigar was half gone, because he looked soviciously anxious. He regarded us as his own legitimate prey, by rightof discovery, I think, because he drove off several other professionalswho wanted to take stock in us.
Now, they surely must chew up those old stubs, and dry and sell them forsmoking-tobacco. Therefore, give your custom to other than Italianbrands of the article.
"The Superb" and the "City of Palaces" are names which Genoa has held forcenturies. She is full of palaces, certainly, and the palaces aresumptuous inside, but they are very rusty without and make no pretensionsto architectural magnificence. "Genoa the Superb" would be a felicitoustitle if it referred to the women.
We have visited several of the palaces--immense thick-walled piles, withgreat stone staircases, tesselated marble pavements on the floors,(sometimes they make a mosaic work, of intricate designs, wrought inpebbles or little fragments of marble laid in cement,) and grand salonshung with pictures by Rubens, Guido, Titian, Paul Veronese, and so on,and portraits of heads of the family, in plumed helmets and gallant coatsof mail, and patrician ladies in stunning costumes of centuries ago.But, of course, the folks were all out in the country for the summer, andmight not have known enough to ask us to dinner if they had been at home,and so all the grand empty salons, with their resounding pavements, theirgrim pictures of dead ancestors, and tattered banners with the dust ofbygone centuries upon them, seemed to brood solemnly of death and thegrave, and our spirits ebbed away, and our cheerfulness passed from us.We never went up to the eleventh story. We always began to suspectghosts. There was always an undertaker-looking servant along, too, whohanded us a program, pointed to the picture that began the list of thesalon he was in, and then stood stiff and stark and unsmiling in hispetrified livery till we were ready to move on to the next chamber,whereupon he marched sadly ahead and took up another malignantlyrespectful position as before. I wasted so much time praying that theroof would fall in on these dispiriting flunkies that I had but littleleft to bestow upon palace and pictures.
And besides, as in Paris, we had a guide. Perdition catch all theguides. This one said he was the most gifted linguist in Genoa, as faras English was concerned, and that only two persons in the city besidehimself could talk the language at all. He showed us the birthplace ofChristopher Columbus, and after we had reflected in silent awe before itfor fifteen minutes, he said it was not the birthplace of Columbus, butof Columbus' grandmother! When we demanded an explanation of his conducthe only shrugged his shoulders and answered in barbarous Italian. Ishall speak further of this guide in a future chapter. All theinformation we got out of him we shall be able to carry along with us, Ithink.
I have not been to church so often in a long time as I have in the lastfew weeks. The people in these old lands seem to make churches theirspecialty. Especially does this seem to be the case with the citizens ofGenoa. I think there is a church every three or four hundred yards allover town. The streets are sprinkled from end to end with shovel-hatted,long-robed, well-fed priests, and the church bells by dozens are pealingall the day long, nearly. Every now and then one comes across a friar oforders gray, with shaven head, long, coarse robe, rope girdle and beads,and with feet cased in sandals or entirely bare. These worthies sufferin the flesh and do penance all their lives, I suppose, but they looklike consummate famine-breeders. They are all fat and serene.
The old Cathedral of San Lorenzo is about as notable a building as wehave found in Genoa. It is vast, and has colonnades of noble pillars,and a great organ, and the customary pomp of gilded moldings, pictures,frescoed ceilings, and so forth. I cannot describe it, of course--itwould require a good many pages to do that. But it is a curious place.They said that half of it--from the front door halfway down to the altar--was a Jewish synagogue before the Saviour was born, and that noalteration had been made in it since that time. We doubted thestatement, but did it reluctantly. We would much rather have believedit. The place looked in too perfect repair to be so ancient.
The main point of interest about the cathedral is the little Chapel ofSt. John the Baptist. They only allow women to enter it on one day inthe year, on account of the animosity they still cherish against the sexbecause of the murder of the Saint to gratify a caprice of Herodias. Inthis Chapel is a marble chest, in which, they told us, were the ashes ofSt. John; and around it was wound a chain, which, they said, had confinedhim when he was in prison. We did not desire to disbelieve thesestatements, and yet we could not feel certain that they were correct--partly because we could have broken that chain, and so could St. John,and partly because we had seen St. John's ashes before, in anotherchurch. We could not bring ourselves to think St. John had two sets ofashes.
They also showed us a portrait of the Madonna which was painted by St.Luke, and it did not look half as old and smoky as some of the picturesby Rubens. We could not help admiring the Apostle's modesty in neveronce mentioning in his writings that he could paint.
But isn't this relic matter a little overdone? We find a piece of thetrue cross in every old church we go into, and some of the nails thatheld it together. I would not like to be positive, but I think we haveseen as much as a keg of these nails. Then there is the crown of thorns;they have part of one in Sainte Chapelle, in Paris, and part of one alsoin Notre Dame. And as for bones of St. Denis, I feel certain we haveseen enough of them to duplicate him if necessary.
I only meant to write about the churches, but I keep wandering from thesubject. I could say that the Church of the Annunciation is a wildernessof beautiful columns, of statues, gilded moldings, and pictures almostcountless, but that would give no one an entirely perfect idea of thething, and so where is the use? One family built the whole edifice, andhave got money left. There is where the mystery lies. We had an idea atfirst that only a mint could have survived the expense.
These people here live in the heaviest, highest, broadest, darkest,solidest houses one can imagine. Each one might "laugh a siege toscorn." A hundred feet front and a hundred high is about the style, andyou go up three flights of stairs before you begin to come upon signs ofoccupancy. Everything is stone, and stone of the heaviest--floors,stairways, mantels, benches--everything. The walls are four to five feetthick. The streets generally are four or five to eight feet wide and ascrooked as a corkscrew. You go along one of these gloomy cracks, andlook up and behold the sky like a mere ribbon of light, far above yourhead, where the tops of the tall houses on either side of the street bendalmost together. You feel as if you were at the bottom of sometremendous abyss, with all the world far above you. You wind in and outand here and there, in the most mysterious way, and have no more idea ofthe points of the compass than if you were a blind man. You can neverpersuade yourself that these are actually streets, and the frowning,dingy, monstrous houses dwellings, till you see one of these beautiful,prettily dressed women emerge from them--see her emerge from a dark,dreary-looking den that looks dungeon all over, from the ground awayhalfway up to heaven. And then you wonder that such a charming mothcould come from such a forbidding shell as that. The streets are wiselymade narrow and the houses heavy and thick and stony, in order that thepeople may be cool in this roasting climate. And they are cool, and stayso. And while I think of it--the men wear hats and have very darkcomplexions, but the women wear no headgear but a flimsy veil like agossamer's web, and yet are exceedingly fair as a general thing.Singular, isn't it?
The huge palaces of Genoa are each supposed to be occupied by one family,but they could accommodate a hundred, I should think. They are relics ofthe grandeur of Genoa's palmy days--the days when she was a greatcommercial and maritime power several centuries ago. These houses, solidmarble palaces though they be, are in many cases of a dull pinkish color,outside, and from pavement to eaves are pictured with Genoese battlescenes, with monstrous Jupiters and Cupids, and with familiarillustrations from Grecian mythology. Where the paint has yielded to ageand exposure and is peeling off in flakes and patches, the effect is nothappy. A noseless Cupid or a Jupiter with an eye out or a Venus with afly-blister on her breast, are not attractive features in a picture.Some of these painted walls reminded me somewhat of the tall van,plastered with fanciful bills and posters, that follows the bandwagon ofa circus about a country village. I have not read or heard that theoutsides of the houses of any other European city are frescoed in thisway.
I can not conceive of such a thing as Genoa in ruins. Such massivearches, such ponderous substructions as support these toweringbroad-winged edifices, we have seldom seen before; and surely the greatblocks of stone of which these edifices are built can never decay; wallsthat are as thick as an ordinary American doorway is high cannotcrumble.
The republics of Genoa and Pisa were very powerful in the Middle Ages.Their ships filled the Mediterranean, and they carried on an extensivecommerce with Constantinople and Syria. Their warehouses were the greatdistributing depots from whence the costly merchandise of the East wassent abroad over Europe. They were warlike little nations and defied, inthose days, governments that overshadow them now as mountains overshadowmolehills. The Saracens captured and pillaged Genoa nine hundred yearsago, but during the following century Genoa and Pisa entered into anoffensive and defensive alliance and besieged the Saracen colonies inSardinia and the Balearic Isles with an obstinacy that maintained itspristine vigor and held to its purpose for forty long years. They werevictorious at last and divided their conquests equably among their greatpatrician families. Descendants of some of those proud families stillinhabit the palaces of Genoa, and trace in their own features aresemblance to the grim knights whose portraits hang in their statelyhalls, and to pictured beauties with pouting lips and merry eyes whoseoriginals have been dust and ashes for many a dead and forgotten century.
The hotel we live in belonged to one of those great orders of knights ofthe Cross in the times of the Crusades, and its mailed sentinels oncekept watch and ward in its massive turrets and woke the echoes of thesehalls and corridors with their iron heels.
But Genoa's greatness has degenerated into an unostentatious commerce invelvets and silver filagree-work. They say that each European town hasits specialty. These filagree things are Genoa's specialty. Her smithstake silver ingots and work them up into all manner of graceful andbeautiful forms. They make bunches of flowers, from flakes and wires ofsilver, that counterfeit the delicate creations the frost weaves upon awindowpane; and we were shown a miniature silver temple whose flutedcolumns, whose Corinthian capitals and rich entablatures, whose spire,statues, bells, and ornate lavishness of sculpture were wrought inpolished silver, and with such matchless art that every detail was afascinating study and the finished edifice a wonder of beauty.
We are ready to move again, though we are not really tired yet of thenarrow passages of this old marble cave. Cave is a good word--whenspeaking of Genoa under the stars. When we have been prowling atmidnight through the gloomy crevices they call streets, where nofootfalls but ours were echoing, where only ourselves were abroad, andlights appeared only at long intervals and at a distance, andmysteriously disappeared again, and the houses at our elbows seemed tostretch upward farther than ever toward the heavens, the memory of a caveI used to know at home was always in my mind, with its lofty passages,its silence and solitude, its shrouding gloom, its sepulchral echoes, itsflitting lights, and more than all, its sudden revelations of branchingcrevices and corridors where we least expected them.
We are not tired of the endless processions of cheerful, chatteringgossipers that throng these courts and streets all day long, either; norof the coarse-robed monks; nor of the "Asti" wines, which that old doctor(whom we call the Oracle,) with customary felicity in the matter ofgetting everything wrong, misterms "nasty." But we must go,nevertheless.
Our last sight was the cemetery (a burial place intended to accommodate60,000 bodies,) and we shall continue to remember it after we shall haveforgotten the palaces. It is a vast marble collonaded corridor extendingaround a great unoccupied square of ground; its broad floor is marble,and on every slab is an inscription--for every slab covers a corpse. Oneither side, as one walks down the middle of the passage, are monuments,tombs, and sculptured figures that are exquisitely wrought and are fullof grace and beauty. They are new and snowy; every outline is perfect,every feature guiltless of mutilation, flaw, or blemish; and therefore,to us these far-reaching ranks of bewitching forms are a hundred foldmore lovely than the damaged and dingy statuary they have saved from thewreck of ancient art and set up in the galleries of Paris for the worshipof the world.
Well provided with cigars and other necessaries of life, we are now readyto take the cars for Milan.
