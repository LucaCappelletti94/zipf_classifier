The Time Is at Hand
THE YOUNG can sink into abysses of despondency, and it was so with Noeland me now; but the hopes of the young are quick to rise again, and itwas so with ours. We called back that vague promise of the Voices, andsaid the one to the other that the glorious release was to happen at "thelast moment"--"that other time was not the last moment, but this is; itwill happen now; the King will come, La Hire will come, and with them ourveterans, and behind them all France!" And so we were full of heartagain, and could already hear, in fancy, that stirring music the clash ofsteel and the war-cries and the uproar of the onset, and in fancy see ourprisoner free, her chains gone, her sword in her hand.
But this dream was to pass also, and come to nothing. Late at night, whenManchon came in, he said:
"I am come from the dungeon, and I have a message for you from that poorchild."
A message to me! If he had been noticing I think he would have discoveredme--discovered that my indifference concerning the prisoner was apretense; for I was caught off my guard, and was so moved and so exaltedto be so honored by her that I must have shown my feeling in my face andmanner.
"A message for me, your reverence?"
"Yes. It is something she wishes done. She said she had noticed the youngman who helps me, and that he had a good face; and did I think he woulddo a kindness for her? I said I knew you would, and asked her what itwas, and she said a letter--would you write a letter to her mother?
"And I said you would. But I said I would do it myself, and gladly; butshe said no, that my labors were heavy, and she thought the young manwould not mind the doing of this service for one not able to do it forherself, she not knowing how to write. Then I would have sent for you,and at that the sadness vanished out of her face. Why, it was as if shewas going to see a friend, poor friendless thing. But I was notpermitted. I did my best, but the orders remain as strict as ever, thedoors are closed against all but officials; as before, none but officialsmay speak to her. So I went back and told her, and she sighed, and wassad again. Now this is what she begs you to write to her mother. It ispartly a strange message, and to me means nothing, but she said hermother would understand. You will 'convey her adoring love to her familyand her village friends, and say there will be no rescue, for that thisnight--and it is the third time in the twelvemonth, and is final--she hasseen the Vision of the Tree.'"
"How strange!"
"Yes, it is strange, but that is what she said; and said her parentswould understand. And for a little time she was lost in dreams andthinkings, and her lips moved, and I caught in her muttering these lines,which she said over two or three times, and they seemed to bring peaceand contentment to her. I set them down, thinking they might have someconnection with her letter and be useful; but it was not so; they were amere memory, floating idly in a tired mind, and they have no meaning, atleast no relevancy."
I took the piece of paper, and found what I knew I should find:
And when in exile wand'ring, we Shall fainting yearn for glimpse of thee,Oh, rise upon our sight!
There was no hope any more. I knew it now. I knew that Joan's letter wasa message to Noel and me, as well as to her family, and that its objectwas to banish vain hopes from our minds and tell us from her own mouth ofthe blow that was going to fall upon us, so that we, being her soldiers,would know it for a command to bear it as became us and her, and sosubmit to the will of God; and in thus obeying, find assuagement of ourgrief. It was like her, for she was always thinking of others, not ofherself. Yes, her heart was sore for us; she could find time to think ofus, the humblest of her servants, and try to soften our pain, lighten theburden of our troubles--she that was drinking of the bitter waters; shethat was walking in the Valley of the Shadow of Death.
I wrote the letter. You will know what it cost me, without my tellingyou. I wrote it with the same wooden stylus which had put upon parchmentthe first words ever dictated by Joan of Arc--that high summons to theEnglish to vacate France, two years past, when she was a lass ofseventeen; it had now set down the last ones which she was ever todictate. Then I broke it. For the pen that had served Joan of Arc couldnot serve any that would come after her in this earth without abasement.
The next day, May 29th, Cauchon summoned his serfs, and forty-tworesponded. It is charitable to believe that the other twenty were ashamedto come. The forty-two pronounced her a relapsed heretic, and condemnedher to be delivered over to the secular arm. Cauchon thanked them.
Then he sent orders that Joan of Arc be conveyed the next morning to theplace known as the Old Market; and that she be then delivered to thecivil judge, and by the civil judge to the executioner. That meant shewould be burnt.
All the afternoon and evening of Tuesday, the 29th, the news was flying,and the people of the country-side flocking to Rouen to see thetragedy--all, at least, who could prove their English sympathies andcount upon admission. The press grew thicker and thicker in the streets,the excitement grew higher and higher. And now a thing was noticeableagain which had been noticeable more than once before--that there waspity for Joan in the hearts of many of these people. Whenever she hadbeen in great danger it had manifested itself, and now it was apparentagain--manifest in a pathetic dumb sorrow which was visible in manyfaces.
Early the next morning, Wednesday, Martin Ladvenu and another friar weresent to Joan to prepare her for death; and Manchon and I went withthem--a hard service for me. We tramped through the dim corridors,winding this way and that, and piercing ever deeper and deeper into thatvast heart of stone, and at last we stood before Joan. But she did notknow it. She sat with her hands in her lap and her head bowed, thinking,and her face was very sad. One might not know what she was thinking of.Of her home, and the peaceful pastures, and the friends she was no moreto see? Of her wrongs, and her forsaken estate, and the cruelties whichhad been put upon her? Or was it of death--the death which she had longedfor, and which was now so close?
Or was it of the kind of death she must suffer? I hoped not; for shefeared only one kind, and that one had for her unspeakable terrors. Ibelieved she so feared that one that with her strong will she would shutthe thought of it wholly out of her mind, and hope and believe that Godwould take pity on her and grant her an easier one; and so it mightchance that the awful news which we were bringing might come as asurprise to her at last.
We stood silent awhile, but she was still unconscious of us, still deepin her sad musings and far away. Then Martin Ladvenu said, softly:
"Joan."
She looked up then, with a little start and a wan smile, and said:
"Speak. Have you a message for me?"
"Yes, my poor child. Try to bear it. Do you think you can bear it?"
"Yes"--very softly, and her head drooped again.
"I am come to prepare you for death."
A faint shiver trembled through her wasted body. There was a pause. Inthe stillness we could hear our breathings. Then she said, still in thatlow voice:
"When will it be?"
The muffled notes of a tolling bell floated to our ears out of thedistance.
"Now. The time is at hand."
That slight shiver passed again.
"It is so soon--ah, it is so soon!"
There was a long silence. The distant throbbings of the bell pulsedthrough it, and we stood motionless and listening. But it was broken atlast:
"What death is it?"
"By fire!"
"Oh, I knew it, I knew it!" She sprang wildly to her feet, and wound herhands in her hair, and began to writhe and sob, oh, so piteously, andmourn and grieve and lament, and turn to first one and then another ofus, and search our faces beseechingly, as hoping she might find help andfriendliness there, poor thing--she that had never denied these to anycreature, even her wounded enemy on the battle-field.
"Oh, cruel, cruel, to treat me so! And must my body, that has never beendefiled, be consumed today and turned to ashes? Ah, sooner would I thatmy head were cut off seven times than suffer this woeful death. I had thepromise of the Church's prison when I submitted, and if I had but beenthere, and not left here in the hands of my enemies, this miserable fatehad not befallen me.
"Oh, I appeal to God the Great Judge, against the injustice which hasbeen done me."
There was none there that could endure it. They turned away, with thetears running down their faces. In a moment I was on my knees at herfeet. At once she thought only of my danger, and bent and whispered in myhear: "Up!--do not peril yourself, good heart. There--God bless youalways!" and I felt the quick clasp of her hand. Mine was the last handshe touched with hers in life. None saw it; history does not know of itor tell of it, yet it is true, just as I have told it. The next momentshe saw Cauchon coming, and she went and stood before him and reproachedhim, saying:
"Bishop, it is by you that I die!"
He was not shamed, not touched; but said, smoothly:
"Ah, be patient, Joan. You die because you have not kept your promise,but have returned to your sins."
"Alas," she said, "if you had put me in the Church's prison, and given meright and proper keepers, as you promised, this would not have happened.And for this I summon you to answer before God!"
Then Cauchon winced, and looked less placidly content than before, and heturned him about and went away.
Joan stood awhile musing. She grew calmer, but occasionally she wiped hereyes, and now and then sobs shook her body; but their violence wasmodifying now, and the intervals between them were growing longer.Finally she looked up and saw Pierre Maurice, who had come in with theBishop, and she said to him:
"Master Peter, where shall I be this night?"
"Have you not good hope in God?"
"Yes--and by His grace I shall be in Paradise."
Now Martin Ladvenu heard her in confession; then she begged for thesacrament. But how grant the communion to one who had been publicly cutoff from the Church, and was now no more entitled to its privileges thanan unbaptized pagan? The brother could not do this, but he sent toCauchon to inquire what he must do. All laws, human and divine, werealike to that man--he respected none of them. He sent back orders togrant Joan whatever she wished. Her last speech to him had reached hisfears, perhaps; it could not reach his heart, for he had none.
The Eucharist was brought now to that poor soul that had yearned for itwith such unutterable longing all these desolate months. It was a solemnmoment. While we had been in the deeps of the prison, the public courtsof the castle had been filling up with crowds of the humbler sort of menand women, who had learned what was going on in Joan's cell, and had comewith softened hearts to do--they knew not what; to hear--they knew notwhat. We knew nothing of this, for they were out of our view. And therewere other great crowds of the like caste gathered in masses outside thecastle gates. And when the lights and the other accompaniments of theSacrament passed by, coming to Joan in the prison, all those multitudeskneeled down and began to pray for her, and many wept; and when thesolemn ceremony of the communion began in Joan's cell, out of thedistance a moving sound was borne moaning to our ears--it was thoseinvisible multitudes chanting the litany for a departing soul.
The fear of the fiery death was gone from Joan of Arc now, to come againno more, except for one fleeting instant--then it would pass, andserenity and courage would take its place and abide till the end.
