  Hollow rang the house when I knocked on the door,	And I lingered on the threshold with my hand	Upraised to knock and knock once more:	Listening for the sound of her feet across the floor,	Hollow re-echoed my heart.  The low-hung lamps stretched down the road	With shadows drifting underneath,	With a music of soft, melodious feet	Quickening my hope as I hastened to meet	The low-hung light of her eyes.  The golden lamps down the street went out,	The last car trailed the night behind;	And I in the darkness wandered about	With a flutter of hope and of dark-shut doubt	In the dying lamp of my love.  Two brown ponies trotting slowly	Stopped at a dim-lit trough to drink:	The dark van drummed down the distance slowly;	While the city stars so dim and holy	Drew nearer to search through the streets.  A hastening car swept shameful past,	I saw her hid in the shadow,	I saw her step to the curb, and fast	Run to the silent door, where last	I had stood with my hand uplifted. She clung to the door in her haste to enter,	Entered, and quickly cast	It shut behind her, leaving the street aghast.
