"Did you do as I told you?  Did you look up the Mexican Plug?"
"Yes, I made his acquaintance before night and got his friendship."
"I liked him.  Did you?"
"Not at first.  He took me for a reptile, and it troubled me,because I didn't know whether it was a compliment or not.  Icouldn't ask him, because it would look ignorant.  So I didn't sayanything, and soon liked him very well indeed.  Was it acompliment, do you think?"
"Yes, that is what it was.  They are very rare, the reptiles; veryfew left, now-a-days."
"Is that so?  What is a reptile?"
"It is a plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hasn'tany wings and is uncertain."
"Well, it - it sounds fine, it surely does."
"And it IS fine.  You may be thankful you are one."
"I am.  It seems wonderfully grand and elegant for a person that isso humble as I am; but I am thankful, I am indeed, and will try tolive up to it.  It is hard to remember.  Will you say it again,please, and say it slow?"
"Plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hasn't any wingsand is uncertain."
"It is beautiful, anybody must grant it; beautiful, and of a noblesound.  I hope it will not make me proud and stuck-up - I shouldnot like to be that.  It is much more distinguished and honorableto be a reptile than a dog, don't you think, Soldier?"
"Why, there's no comparison.  It is awfully aristocratic.  Often aduke is called a reptile; it is set down so, in history."
"Isn't that grand!  Potter wouldn't ever associate with me, but Ireckon he'll be glad to when he finds out what I am."
"You can depend upon it."
"I will thank Mongrel for this. He is a very good sort, for aMexican Plug.  Don't you think he is?"
"It is my opinion of him; and as for his birth, he cannot helpthat.  We cannot all be reptiles, we cannot all be fossils; we haveto take what comes and be thankful it is no worse.  It is the truephilosophy."
"For those others?"
"Stick to the subject, please.  Did it turn out that my suspicionswere right?"
"Yes, perfectly right.  Mongrel has heard them planning.  They areafter BB's life, for running them out of Medicine Bow and takingtheir stolen horses away from them."
"Well, they'll get him yet, for sure."
"Not if he keeps a sharp look-out."
"HE keep a sharp lookout!  He never does; he despises them, and alltheir kind.  His life is always being threatened, and so it hascome to be monotonous."
"Does he know they are here?"
"Oh yes, he knows it.  He is always the earliest to know who comesand who goes.  But he cares nothing for them and their threats; heonly laughs when people warn him.  They'll shoot him from behind atree the first he knows.  Did Mongrel tell you their plans?"
"Yes.  They have found out that he starts for Fort Clayton dayafter to-morrow, with one of his scouts; so they will leave to-morrow, letting on to go south, but they will fetch around northall in good time."
"Shekels, I don't like the look of it."
