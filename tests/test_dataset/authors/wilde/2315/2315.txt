THE ARTIST
ONE evening there came into his soul the desire to fashion an imageof THE PLEASURE THAT ABIDETH FOR A MOMENT. And he went forth intothe world to look for bronze. For he could think only in bronze.
But all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared, nor anywherein the whole world was there any bronze to be found, save only thebronze of the image of THE SORROW THAT ENDURETH FOR EVER.
Now this image he had himself, and with his own hands, fashioned,and had set it on the tomb of the one thing he had loved in life.On the tomb of the dead thing he had most loved had he set thisimage of his own fashioning, that it might serve as a sign of thelove of man that dieth not, and a symbol of the sorrow of man thatendureth for ever. And in the whole world there was no otherbronze save the bronze of this image.
And he took the image he had fashioned, and set it in a greatfurnace, and gave it to the fire.
And out of the bronze of the image of THE SORROW THAT ENDURETH FOREVER he fashioned an image of THE PLEASURE THAT ABIDETH FOR AMOMENT.
THE DOER OF GOOD
It was night-time and He was alone.
And He saw afar-off the walls of a round city and went towards thecity.
And when He came near He heard within the city the tread of thefeet of joy, and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and the loudnoise of many lutes. And He knocked at the gate and certain of thegate-keepers opened to Him.
And He beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars ofmarble before it. The pillars were hung with garlands, and withinand without there were torches of cedar. And He entered the house.
And when He had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the hallof jasper, and reached the long hall of feasting, He saw lying on acouch of sea-purple one whose hair was crowned with red roses andwhose lips were red with wine.
And He went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and said tohim, 'Why do you live like this?'
And the young man turned round and recognised Him, and made answerand said, 'But I was a leper once, and you healed me. How elseshould I live?'
And He passed out of the house and went again into the street.
And after a little while He saw one whose face and raiment werepainted and whose feet were shod with pearls. And behind her came,slowly as a hunter, a young man who wore a cloak of two colours.Now the face of the woman was as the fair face of an idol, and theeyes of the young man were bright with lust.
And He followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man andsaid to him, 'Why do you look at this woman and in such wise?'
And the young man turned round and recognised Him and said, 'But Iwas blind once, and you gave me sight. At what else should Ilook?'
And He ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman andsaid to her, 'Is there no other way in which to walk save the wayof sin?'
And the woman turned round and recognised Him, and laughed andsaid, 'But you forgave me my sins, and the way is a pleasant way.'
And He passed out of the city.
And when He had passed out of the city He saw seated by theroadside a young man who was weeping.
And He went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair andsaid to him, 'Why are you weeping?'
And the young man looked up and recognised Him and made answer,'But I was dead once, and you raised me from the dead. What elseshould I do but weep?'
THE DISCIPLE
When Narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup ofsweet waters into a cup of salt tears, and the Oreads came weepingthrough the woodland that they might sing to the pool and give itcomfort.
And when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweetwaters into a cup of salt tears, they loosened the green tresses oftheir hair and cried to the pool and said, 'We do not wonder thatyou should mourn in this manner for Narcissus, so beautiful washe.'
'But was Narcissus beautiful?' said the pool.
'Who should know that better than you?' answered the Oreads. 'Usdid he ever pass by, but you he sought for, and would lie on yourbanks and look down at you, and in the mirror of your waters hewould mirror his own beauty.'
And the pool answered, 'But I loved Narcissus because, as he lay onmy banks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his eyes I sawever my own beauty mirrored.'
THE MASTER
Now when the darkness came over the earth Joseph of Arimathea,having lighted a torch of pinewood, passed down from the hill intothe valley. For he had business in his own home.
And kneeling on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation he sawa young man who was naked and weeping. His hair was the colour ofhoney, and his body was as a white flower, but he had wounded hisbody with thorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown.
And he who had great possessions said to the young man who wasnaked and weeping, 'I do not wonder that your sorrow is so great,for surely He was a just man.'
And the young man answered, 'It is not for Him that I am weeping,but for myself. I too have changed water into wine, and I havehealed the leper and given sight to the blind. I have walked uponthe waters, and from the dwellers in the tombs I have cast outdevils. I have fed the hungry in the desert where there was nofood, and I have raised the dead from their narrow houses, and atmy bidding, and before a great multitude, of people, a barren fig-tree withered away. All things that this man has done I have donealso. And yet they have not crucified me.'
THE HOUSE OF JUDGMENT
And there was silence in the House of Judgment, and the Man camenaked before God.
And God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.
And God said to the Man, 'Thy life hath been evil, and thou hastshown cruelty to those who were in need of succour, and to thosewho lacked help thou hast been bitter and hard of heart. The poorcalled to thee and thou didst not hearken, and thine ears wereclosed to the cry of My afflicted. The inheritance of thefatherless thou didst take unto thyself, and thou didst send thefoxes into the vineyard of thy neighbour's field. Thou didst takethe bread of the children and give it to the dogs to eat, and Mylepers who lived in the marshes, and were at peace and praised Me,thou didst drive forth on to the highways, and on Mine earth out ofwhich I made thee thou didst spill innocent blood.'
And the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'
And again God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.
And God said to the Man, 'Thy life hath been evil, and the Beauty Ihave shown thou hast sought for, and the Good I have hidden thoudidst pass by. The walls of thy chamber were painted with images,
and from the bed of thine abominations thou didst rise up to thesound of flutes. Thou didst build seven altars to the sins I havesuffered, and didst eat of the thing that may not be eaten, and thepurple of thy raiment was broidered with the three signs of shame.Thine idols were neither of gold nor of silver that endure, but offlesh that dieth. Thou didst stain their hair with perfumes andput pomegranates in their hands. Thou didst stain their feet withsaffron and spread carpets before them. With antimony thou didststain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear with myrrh.Thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them, and the thronesof thine idols were set in the sun. Thou didst show to the sun thyshame and to the moon thy madness.'
And the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'
And a third time God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.
And God said to the Man, 'Evil hath been thy life, and with evildidst thou requite good, and with wrongdoing kindness. The handsthat fed thee thou didst wound, and the breasts that gave thee suckthou didst despise. He who came to thee with water went awaythirsting, and the outlawed men who hid thee in their tents atnight thou didst betray before dawn. Thine enemy who spared theethou didst snare in an ambush, and the friend who walked with theethou didst sell for a price, and to those who brought thee Lovethou didst ever give Lust in thy turn.'
And the Man made answer and said, 'Even so did I.'
And God closed the Book of the Life of the Man, and said, 'Surely Iwill send thee into Hell. Even into Hell will I send thee.'
And the Man cried out, 'Thou canst not.'
And God said to the Man, 'Wherefore can I not send thee to Hell,and for what reason?'
'Because in Hell have I always lived,' answered the Man.
And there was silence in the House of Judgment.
And after a space God spake, and said to the Man, 'Seeing that Imay not send thee into Hell, surely I will send thee unto Heaven.Even unto Heaven will I send thee.'
And the Man cried out, 'Thou canst not.'
And God said to the Man, 'Wherefore can I not send thee untoHeaven, and for what reason?'
'Because never, and in no place, have I been able to imagine it,'answered the Man.
And there was silence in the House of Judgment.
THE TEACHER OF WISDOM
From his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfectknowledge of God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of thesaints, as well as certain holy women who dwelt in the free city ofhis birth, had been stirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom ofhis answers.
And when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhoodhe kissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that hemight speak to the world about God. For there were at that timemany in the world who either knew not God at all, or had but anincomplete knowledge of Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwellin groves and have no care of their worshippers.
And he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking withoutsandals, as he had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdlea leathern wallet and a little water-bottle of burnt clay.
And as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy thatcomes from the perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises untoGod without ceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land inwhich there were many cities.
And he passed through eleven cities. And some of these cities werein valleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, andothers were set on hills. And in each city he found a disciple wholoved him and followed him, and a great multitude also of peoplefollowed him from each city, and the knowledge of God spread in thewhole land, and many of the rulers were converted, and the priestsof the temples in which there were idols found that half of theirgain was gone, and when they beat upon their drums at noon none, orbut a few, came with peacocks and with offerings of flesh as hadbeen the custom of the land before his coming.
Yet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number ofhis disciples, the greater became his sorrow. And he knew not whyhis sorrow was so great. For he spake ever about God, and out ofthe fulness of that perfect knowledge of God which God had Himselfgiven to him.
And one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was acity of Armenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of peoplefollowed after him; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down ona rock that was on the mountain, and his disciples stood round him,and the multitude knelt in the valley.
And he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul,'Why is it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of mydisciples is an enemy that walks in the noonday?' And his Soulanswered him and said, 'God filled thee with the perfect knowledgeof Himself, and thou hast given this knowledge away to others. Thepearl of great price thou hast divided, and the vesture withoutseam thou hast parted asunder. He who giveth away wisdom robbethhimself. He is as one who giveth his treasure to a robber. Is notGod wiser than thou art? Who art thou to give away the secret thatGod hath told thee? I was rich once, and thou hast made me poor.Once I saw God, and now thou hast hidden Him from me.'
And he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him,and that he had given to others the perfect knowledge of God, andthat he was as one clinging to the skirts of God, and that hisfaith was leaving him by reason of the number of those who believedin him.
And he said to himself, 'I will talk no more about God. He whogiveth away wisdom robbeth himself.'
And after the space of some hours his disciples came near him andbowed themselves to the ground and said, 'Master, talk to us aboutGod, for thou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and no man savethee hath this knowledge.'
And he answered them and said, 'I will talk to you about all otherthings that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will nottalk to you. Neither now, nor at any time, will I talk to youabout God.'
And they were wroth with him and said to him, 'Thou hast led usinto the desert that we might hearken to thee. Wilt thou send usaway hungry, and the great multitude that thou hast made to followthee?'
And he answered them and said, 'I will not talk to you about God.'
And the multitude murmured against him and said to him, 'Thou hastled us into the desert, and hast given us no food to eat. Talk tous about God and it will suffice us.'
But he answered them not a word. For he knew that if he spake tothem about God he would give away his treasure.
And his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of peoplereturned to their own homes. And many died on the way.
And when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, andjourneyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making anyanswer. And when the seventh moon had waned he reached that desertwhich is the desert of the Great River. And having found a cavernin which a Centaur had once dwelt, he took it for his place ofdwelling, and made himself a mat of reeds on which to lie, andbecame a hermit. And every hour the Hermit praised God that He hadsuffered him to keep some knowledge of Him and of His wonderfulgreatness.
Now, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern inwhich he had made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man ofevil and beautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and withempty hands. Every evening with empty hands the young man passedby, and every morning he returned with his hands full of purple andpearls. For he was a Robber and robbed the caravans of themerchants.
And the Hermit looked at him and pitied him. But he spake not aword. For he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.
And one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full ofpurple and pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot uponthe sand, and said to the Hermit: 'Why do you look at me ever inthis manner as I pass by? What is it that I see in your eyes? Forno man has looked at me before in this manner. And the thing is athorn and a trouble to me.'
And the Hermit answered him and said, 'What you see in my eyes ispity. Pity is what looks out at you from my eyes.'
And the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in abitter voice, and said to him, 'I have purple and pearls in myhands, and you have but a mat of reeds on which to lie. What pityshould you have for me? And for what reason have you this pity?'
'I have pity for you,' said the Hermit, 'because you have noknowledge of God.'
'Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?' asked the young man,and he came close to the mouth of the cavern.
'It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of theworld,' answered the Hermit.
'And have you got it?' said the young Robber, and he came closerstill.
'Once, indeed,' answered the Hermit, 'I possessed the perfectknowledge of God. But in my foolishness I parted with it, anddivided it amongst others. Yet even now is such knowledge asremains to me more precious than purple or pearls.'
And when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple andthe pearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharpsword of curved steel he said to the Hermit, 'Give me, forthwiththis knowledge of God that you possess, or I will surely slay you.Wherefore should I not slay him who has a treasure greater than mytreasure?'
And the Hermit spread out his arms and said, 'Were it not betterfor me to go unto the uttermost courts of God and praise Him, thanto live in the world and have no knowledge of Him? Slay me if thatbe your desire. But I will not give away my knowledge of God.'
And the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermitwould not talk to him about God, nor give him his Treasure, and theyoung Robber rose up and said to the Hermit, 'Be it as you will.As for myself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is butthree days' journey from this place, and for my purple they willgive me pleasure, and for my pearls they will sell me joy.' And hetook up the purple and the pearls and went swiftly away.
And the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him. Forthe space of three days he followed the young Robber on the roadand entreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of theSeven Sins.
And ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit andcalled to him, and said, 'Will you give me this knowledge of Godwhich is more precious than purple and pearls? If you will give methat, I will not enter the city.'
And ever did the Hermit answer, 'All things that I have I will givethee, save that one thing only. For that thing it is not lawfulfor me to give away.'
And in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the greatscarlet gates of the City of the Seven Sins. And from the citythere came the sound of much laughter.
And the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at thegate. And as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him bythe skirts of his raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth yourhands, and set your arms around my neck, and put your ear close tomy lips, and I will give you what remains to me of the knowledge ofGod.' And the young Robber stopped.
And when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he fellupon the ground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him thecity and the young Robber, so that he saw them no more.
And as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standingbeside him; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brassand hair like fine wool. And He raised the Hermit up, and said tohim: 'Before this time thou hadst the perfect knowledge of God.Now thou shalt have the perfect love of God. Wherefore art thouweeping?' And he kissed him.
