A nice phrase: "A People's Theatre." But what about it? There's nosuch thing in existence as a People's Theatre: or even on the way toexistence, as far as we can tell. The name is chosen, the baby isn'teven begotten: nay, the would-be parents aren't married, nor yetcourting.
A People's Theatre. Note the indefinite article. It isn't ThePeople's Theatre, but A People's Theatre. Not the theatre of Plebs,the proletariat, but the theatre of A People. What people? Quelpeuple donc?--A People's Theatre. Translate it into French foryourself.
A People's Theatre. Since we can't produce it, let us deduce it.Major premise: the seats are cheap. Minor premiss: the plays aregood. Conclusion: A People's Theatre. How much will you give mefor my syllogism? Not a slap in the eye, I hope.
We stick to our guns. The seats are cheap. That has a nastyproletarian look about it. But appearances are deceptive. Theproletariat isn't poor. Everybody is poor except Capital and Labour.Between these upper and nether millstones great numbers of decentpeople are squeezed.
The seats are cheap: in decency's name. Nobody wants to swank, tosit in the front of a box like a geranium on a window-sill--"thecynosure of many eyes." Nobody wants to profiteer. We all feel thatit is as humiliating to pay high prices as to charge them. No manconsents in his heart to pay high prices unless he feels that what hepays with his right hand he will get back with his left, either outof the pocket of a man who isn't looking, or out of the envy of thepoor neighbour who IS looking, but can't afford the figure. The seatsare cheap. Why should A People, fabulous and lofty giraffe, want tocharge or pay high prices? If it were THE PEOPLE now.--But it isn't.It isn't Plebs, the proletariat. The seats are cheap.
The plays are good. Pah!--this has a canting smell. Any play is goodto the man who likes to look at it. And at that rate Chu Chin Chow isextra-super-good. What about your GOOD plays? Whose good? PFUI toyour goodness!
That minor premiss is a bad egg: it will hatch no bird. Good plays?You might as well say mimsy bomtittle plays, you'd be saying as much.The plays are--don't say good or you'll be beaten. The plays--theplays of A People's Theatre are--oh heaven, what are they?--notpopular nor populous nor plebian nor proletarian nor folk nor parishplays. None of that adjectival spawn.
The only clue-word is People's for all that. A People's---Chasteword, it will bring forth no adjective. The plays of A People'sTheatre are People's plays. The plays of A People's Theatre areplays about people.
It doesn't look much, at first sight. After all--people! Yes,People! Not THE PEOPLE, _i.e._ Plebs, nor yet the Upper Ten.People. Neither Piccoli nor Grandi in our republic. People.
People, ah God! Not mannequins. Not lords nor proletariats norbishops nor husbands nor co-respondents nor virgins nor adultressesnor uncles nor noses. Not even white rabbits nor presidents. People.
Men who are somebody, not men who are something. Men who HAPPEN tobe bishops or co-respondents, women who happen to be chaste, just asthey happen to freckle, because it's one of their innumerable oddqualities. Even men who happen, by the way, to have long noses.But not noses on two legs, not burly pairs of gaiters, stuffed andvoluble, not white meringues of chastity, not incarnations of co-respondence. Not proletariats, petitioners, president's, noses, bitsof fluff. Heavens, what an assortment of bits! And aren't we sickof them!
People, I say. And after all, it's saying something. It's harder tobe a human being than to be a president or a bit of fluff. You canbe a president, or a bit of fluff, or even a nose, by clockwork.Given a role, a PART, you can play it by clockwork. But you can'thave a clockwork human being.
We're dead sick of parts. It's no use your protesting that there isa man behind the nose. We can't see him, and he can't see himself.Nothing but nose. Neither can you make us believe there is a maninside the gaiters. He's never showed his head yet.
It may be, in real life, the gaiters wear the man, as the nose wearsCyrano. It may be Sir Auckland Geddes and Mr. J. H. Thomas are onlyclippings from the illustrated press. It may be that a miner is acomplicated machine for cutting coal and voting on a ballot-paper.It may be that coal-owners are like the _petit bleu_ arrangement, asystem of vacuum tubes for whooshing Bradburys about from one to theother.
It may be that everybody delights in bits, in parts, that the publicinsists on noses, gaiters, white rabbits, bits of fluff, automata andgewgaws. If they do, then let 'em. Chu Chin Chow for ever!
In spite of them all: A People's Theatre. A People's Theatre showsmen, and not parts. Not bits, nor bundles of bits. A whole bunch ofroles tied into one won't make an individual. Though gaiters perish,we will have men.
Although most miners may be pick-cum-shovel-cum-ballot implements,and no more, still, among miners there must be two or three livingindividuals. The same among the masters. The majority are suction-tubes for Bradburys. But is this Sodom of Industrialism there aresurely ten men, all told. My poor little withered grain of mustardseed, I am half afraid to take you across to the seed-testingdepartment!
And if there are men, there is A People's Theatre.
How many tragic situations did Goethe say were possible? Somethinglike thirty-two. Which seems a lot. Anyhow, granted that men aremen still, that not all of them are bits, parts, machine-sections,then we have added another tragic possibility to the list: the Strikesituation. As yet no one tackles this situation. It is a sort ofMedusa head, which turns--no, not to stone, but to sloppy treacle.Mr. Galsworthy had a peep, and sank down towards bathos.
Granted that men are still men, Labour _v_. Capitalism is a tragicstruggle. If men are no more than implements, it is non-tragic andmerely disastrous. In tragedy the man is more than his part. Hamletis more than Prince of Denmark, Macbeth is more than murderer ofDuncan. The man is caught in the wheels of his part, his fate, hemay be torn asunder. He may be killed, but the resistant, integralsoul in him is not destroyed. He comes through, though he dies. Hegoes through with his fate, though death swallows him. And it is inthis facing of fate, this going right through with it, that tragedylies. Tragedy is not disaster. It is a disaster when a cart-wheelgoes over a frog, but it is not a tragedy, not the hugest; not thedeath of ten million men. It is only a cartwheel going over a frog.There must be a supreme STRUGGLE.
In Shakespeare's time it was the people _versus_ king storm that wasbrewing. Majesty was about to have its head off. Come what might,Hamlet and Macbeth and Goneril and Regan had to see the businessthrough.
Now a new wind is getting up. We call it Labour _versus_ Capitalism.We say it is a mere material struggle, a money-grabbing affair. Butthis is only one aspect of it. In so far as men are merely mechanical,the struggle is one which, though it may bring disaster and death tomillions, is no more than accident, an accidental collision of forces.But in so far as men are men, the situation is tragic. It is notreally the bone we are fighting for. We are fighting to havesomebody's head off. The conflict is in pure, passional antagonism,turning upon the poles of belief. Majesty was only _hors d'oevres_to this tragic repast.
So, the strike situation has this dual aspect. First it is amechanico-material struggle, two mechanical forces pulling asunderfrom the central object, the bone. All it can result in is thepulling asunder of the fabric of civilisation, and even of life,without any creative issue. It is no more than a frog under a cart-wheel. The mechanical forces, rolling on, roll over the body of lifeand squash it.
The second is the tragic aspect. According to this view, we seemore than two dogs fighting for a bone, and life hopping under theJuggernaut wheel. The two dogs are making the bone a pretext for afight with each other. That old bull-dog, the British capitalist,has got the bone in his teeth. That unsatisfied mongrel, Plebs, theproletariat, shivers with rage not so much at the sight of the bone,as at sight of the great wrinkled jowl that holds it. There is theold dog, with his knowing look and his massive grip on the bone: andthere is the insatiable mongrel, with his great splay paws. The oneis all head and arrogance, the other all paws and grudge. The boneis only the pretext. A first condition of the being of Bully is thathe shall hate the prowling great paws of the Plebs, whilst Plebs byinherent nature goes mad at the sight of Bully's jowl. "Drop it!"cries Plebs. "Hands off!" growls Bully. It is hands against head,the shambling, servile body in a rage of insurrection at last againstthe wrinkled, heavy head.
Labour not only wants his debt. He wants his pound of flesh. It isa quandary. In our heart of hearts we must admit the debt. We mustadmit that it is long overdue. But this last condition! In vain westudy our anatomy to see which part we can best spare.
Where is our Portia, to save us with a timely quibble? We've plentyof Portias. They've recited their heads off--"The quality of mercyis not strained." But the old Shylock of the proletariat persists.He pops up again, and says, "All right, I can't have my pound of fleshwith the blood. But then you can't keep my pound of flesh with yourblood--you owe it to me. It is your business to deliver the goods.Deliver it then--with or without blood--deliver it." The Portiascratches her head, and thinks again.
What's the solution? There is no solution. But still there is achoice. There's a choice between a mess and a tragedy. If Plebs andBully hang on one to each end of the bone, and pull for grim life,they will at last tear the bone to atoms: in short, destroy the wholematerial substance of life, and so perish by accident, no better thana frog under the wheel of destiny. That may be a disaster, but it isonly a mess for all that.
On the other hand, if they have a fight to fight they might reallydrop the bone. Instead of wrangling the bone to bits they mightreally go straight for one another. They are like hostile parties onboard a ship, who both proceed to scuttle the ship so as to sink theother party. Down goes the ship, with all the bally lot on board. Afew survivors swim and squeal among the bubbles--and then silence.
It is too much to suppose that the combatants will ever drop theobvious old bone. But it is not too much to imagine that some menmight acknowledge the bone to be merely a pretext, and hollow _casusbelli_. If we really could know what we were fighting for, if weif we could deeply believe in what we were fighting for, then thestruggle might have dignity, beauty, satisfaction for us. If it werea profound struggle for something that was coming to life in us, astruggle that we were convinced would bring us to a new freedom, anew life, then it would be a creative activity, a creative activityin which death is a climax in the progression towards new being. Andthis is tragedy.
Therefore, if we could but comprehend or feel the tragedy in thegreat Labour struggle, the intrinsic tragedy of having to passthrough death to birth, our souls would still know some happiness,the very happiness of creative suffering. Instead of which we pileaccident on accident, we tear the fabric of our existence fibre byfibre, we confidently look forward to the time when the whole greatstructure will come down on our heads. Yet after all that, when weare squirming under the debris, we shall have no more faith or hopeor satisfaction than we have now. We shall crawl from under onecart-wheel straight under another.
The essence of tragedy, which is creative crisis, is that a manshould go through with his fate, and not dodge it and go bumping intoan accident. And the whole business of life, at the great criticalperiods of mankind, is that men should accept and be one with theirtragedy. Therefore we should open our hearts. For one thing weshould have a People's Theatre. Perhaps it would help us in thishour of confusion better than anything.
