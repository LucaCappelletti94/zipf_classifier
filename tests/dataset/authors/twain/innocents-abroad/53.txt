A fast walker could go outside the walls of Jerusalem and walk entirelyaround the city in an hour. I do not know how else to make oneunderstand how small it is. The appearance of the city is peculiar. Itis as knobby with countless little domes as a prison door is withbolt-heads. Every house has from one to half a dozen of these whiteplastered domes of stone, broad and low, sitting in the centre of, or ina cluster upon, the flat roof. Wherefore, when one looks down from aneminence, upon the compact mass of houses (so closely crowded together,in fact, that there is no appearance of streets at all, and so the citylooks solid,) he sees the knobbiest town in the world, exceptConstantinople. It looks as if it might be roofed, from centre tocircumference, with inverted saucers. The monotony of the view isinterrupted only by the great Mosque of Omar, the Tower of Hippicus, andone or two other buildings that rise into commanding prominence.
The houses are generally two stories high, built strongly of masonry,whitewashed or plastered outside, and have a cage of wooden lattice-workprojecting in front of every window. To reproduce a Jerusalem street, itwould only be necessary to up-end a chicken-coop and hang it before eachwindow in an alley of American houses.
The streets are roughly and badly paved with stone, and are tolerablycrooked--enough so to make each street appear to close togetherconstantly and come to an end about a hundred yards ahead of a pilgrim aslong as he chooses to walk in it. Projecting from the top of the lowerstory of many of the houses is a very narrow porch-roof or shed, withoutsupports from below; and I have several times seen cats jump across thestreet from one shed to the other when they were out calling. The catscould have jumped double the distance without extraordinary exertion. Imention these things to give an idea of how narrow the streets are.Since a cat can jump across them without the least inconvenience, it ishardly necessary to state that such streets are too narrow for carriages.These vehicles cannot navigate the Holy City.
The population of Jerusalem is composed of Moslems, Jews, Greeks, Latins,Armenians, Syrians, Copts, Abyssinians, Greek Catholics, and a handful ofProtestants. One hundred of the latter sect are all that dwell now inthis birthplace of Christianity. The nice shades of nationalitycomprised in the above list, and the languages spoken by them, arealtogether too numerous to mention. It seems to me that all the racesand colors and tongues of the earth must be represented among thefourteen thousand souls that dwell in Jerusalem. Rags, wretchedness,poverty and dirt, those signs and symbols that indicate the presence ofMoslem rule more surely than the crescent-flag itself, abound. Lepers,cripples, the blind, and the idiotic, assail you on every hand, and theyknow but one word of but one language apparently--the eternal"bucksheesh." To see the numbers of maimed, malformed and diseasedhumanity that throng the holy places and obstruct the gates, one mightsuppose that the ancient days had come again, and that the angel of theLord was expected to descend at any moment to stir the waters ofBethesda. Jerusalem is mournful, and dreary, and lifeless. I would notdesire to live here.
One naturally goes first to the Holy Sepulchre. It is right in the city,near the western gate; it and the place of the Crucifixion, and, in fact,every other place intimately connected with that tremendous event, areingeniously massed together and covered by one roof--the dome of theChurch of the Holy Sepulchre.
Entering the building, through the midst of the usual assemblage ofbeggars, one sees on his left a few Turkish guards--for Christians ofdifferent sects will not only quarrel, but fight, also, in this sacredplace, if allowed to do it. Before you is a marble slab, which coversthe Stone of Unction, whereon the Saviour's body was laid to prepare itfor burial. It was found necessary to conceal the real stone in this wayin order to save it from destruction. Pilgrims were too much given tochipping off pieces of it to carry home. Near by is a circular railingwhich marks the spot where the Virgin stood when the Lord's body wasanointed.
Entering the great Rotunda, we stand before the most sacred locality inChristendom--the grave of Jesus. It is in the centre of the church, andimmediately under the great dome. It is inclosed in a sort of littletemple of yellow and white stone, of fanciful design. Within the littletemple is a portion of the very stone which was rolled away from the doorof the Sepulchre, and on which the angel was sitting when Mary camethither "at early dawn." Stooping low, we enter the vault--the Sepulchreitself. It is only about six feet by seven, and the stone couch on whichthe dead Saviour lay extends from end to end of the apartment andoccupies half its width. It is covered with a marble slab which has beenmuch worn by the lips of pilgrims. This slab serves as an altar, now.Over it hang some fifty gold and silver lamps, which are kept alwaysburning, and the place is otherwise scandalized by trumpery, gewgaws, andtawdry ornamentation.
All sects of Christians (except Protestants,) have chapels under the roofof the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, and each must keep to itself and notventure upon another's ground. It has been proven conclusively that theycan not worship together around the grave of the Saviour of the World inpeace. The chapel of the Syrians is not handsome; that of the Copts isthe humblest of them all. It is nothing but a dismal cavern, roughlyhewn in the living rock of the Hill of Calvary. In one side of it twoancient tombs are hewn, which are claimed to be those in which Nicodemusand Joseph of Aramathea were buried.
As we moved among the great piers and pillars of another part of thechurch, we came upon a party of black-robed, animal-looking Italianmonks, with candles in their hands, who were chanting something in Latin,and going through some kind of religious performance around a disk ofwhite marble let into the floor. It was there that the risen Saviourappeared to Mary Magdalen in the likeness of a gardener. Near by was asimilar stone, shaped like a star--here the Magdalen herself stood, atthe same time. Monks were performing in this place also. They performeverywhere--all over the vast building, and at all hours. Their candlesare always flitting about in the gloom, and making the dim old churchmore dismal than there is any necessity that it should be, even though itis a tomb.
We were shown the place where our Lord appeared to His mother after theResurrection. Here, also, a marble slab marks the place where St.Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, found the crosses aboutthree hundred years after the Crucifixion. According to the legend, thisgreat discovery elicited extravagant demonstrations of joy. But theywere of short duration. The question intruded itself: "Which bore theblessed Saviour, and which the thieves?" To be in doubt, in so mighty amatter as this--to be uncertain which one to adore--was a grievousmisfortune. It turned the public joy to sorrow. But when lived there aholy priest who could not set so simple a trouble as this at rest? Oneof these soon hit upon a plan that would be a certain test. A noble ladylay very ill in Jerusalem. The wise priests ordered that the threecrosses be taken to her bedside one at a time. It was done. When hereyes fell upon the first one, she uttered a scream that was heard beyondthe Damascus Gate, and even upon the Mount of Olives, it was said, andthen fell back in a deadly swoon. They recovered her and brought thesecond cross. Instantly she went into fearful convulsions, and it waswith the greatest difficulty that six strong men could hold her. Theywere afraid, now, to bring in the third cross. They began to fear thatpossibly they had fallen upon the wrong crosses, and that the true crosswas not with this number at all. However, as the woman seemed likely todie with the convulsions that were tearing her, they concluded that thethird could do no more than put her out of her misery with a happydispatch. So they brought it, and behold, a miracle! The woman sprangfrom her bed, smiling and joyful, and perfectly restored to health. Whenwe listen to evidence like this, we cannot but believe. We would beashamed to doubt, and properly, too. Even the very part of Jerusalemwhere this all occurred is there yet. So there is really no room fordoubt.
The priests tried to show us, through a small screen, a fragment of thegenuine Pillar of Flagellation, to which Christ was bound when theyscourged him. But we could not see it, because it was dark inside thescreen. However, a baton is kept here, which the pilgrim thrusts througha hole in the screen, and then he no longer doubts that the true Pillarof Flagellation is in there. He can not have any excuse to doubt it, forhe can feel it with the stick. He can feel it as distinctly as he couldfeel any thing.
Not far from here was a niche where they used to preserve a piece of theTrue Cross, but it is gone, now. This piece of the cross was discoveredin the sixteenth century. The Latin priests say it was stolen away, longago, by priests of another sect. That seems like a hard statement tomake, but we know very well that it was stolen, because we have seen itourselves in several of the cathedrals of Italy and France.
But the relic that touched us most was the plain old sword of that stoutCrusader, Godfrey of Bulloigne--King Godfrey of Jerusalem. No blade inChristendom wields such enchantment as this--no blade of all that rust inthe ancestral halls of Europe is able to invoke such visions of romancein the brain of him who looks upon it--none that can prate of suchchivalric deeds or tell such brave tales of the warrior days of old. Itstirs within a man every memory of the Holy Wars that has been sleepingin his brain for years, and peoples his thoughts with mail-clad images,with marching armies, with battles and with sieges. It speaks to him ofBaldwin, and Tancred, the princely Saladin, and great Richard of the LionHeart. It was with just such blades as these that these splendid heroesof romance used to segregate a man, so to speak, and leave the half ofhim to fall one way and the other half the other. This very sword hascloven hundreds of Saracen Knights from crown to chin in those old timeswhen Godfrey wielded it. It was enchanted, then, by a genius that wasunder the command of King Solomon. When danger approached its master'stent it always struck the shield and clanged out a fierce alarm upon thestartled ear of night. In times of doubt, or in fog or darkness, if itwere drawn from its sheath it would point instantly toward the foe, andthus reveal the way--and it would also attempt to start after them of itsown accord. A Christian could not be so disguised that it would not knowhim and refuse to hurt him--nor a Moslem so disguised that it would notleap from its scabbard and take his life. These statements are all wellauthenticated in many legends that are among the most trustworthy legendsthe good old Catholic monks preserve. I can never forget old Godfrey'ssword, now. I tried it on a Moslem, and clove him in twain like adoughnut. The spirit of Grimes was upon me, and if I had had a graveyardI would have destroyed all the infidels in Jerusalem. I wiped the bloodoff the old sword and handed it back to the priest--I did not want thefresh gore to obliterate those sacred spots that crimsoned its brightnessone day six hundred years ago and thus gave Godfrey warning that beforethe sun went down his journey of life would end.
Still moving through the gloom of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre wecame to a small chapel, hewn out of the rock--a place which has beenknown as "The Prison of Our Lord" for many centuries. Tradition saysthat here the Saviour was confined just previously to the crucifixion.Under an altar by the door was a pair of stone stocks for human legs.These things are called the "Bonds of Christ," and the use they were onceput to has given them the name they now bear.
The Greek Chapel is the most roomy, the richest and the showiest chapelin the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Its altar, like that of all theGreek churches, is a lofty screen that extends clear across the chapel,and is gorgeous with gilding and pictures. The numerous lamps that hangbefore it are of gold and silver, and cost great sums.
But the feature of the place is a short column that rises from the middleof the marble pavement of the chapel, and marks the exact centre of theearth. The most reliable traditions tell us that this was known to bethe earth's centre, ages ago, and that when Christ was upon earth he setall doubts upon the subject at rest forever, by stating with his own lipsthat the tradition was correct. Remember, He said that that particularcolumn stood upon the centre of the world. If the centre of the worldchanges, the column changes its position accordingly. This column hasmoved three different times of its own accord. This is because, in greatconvulsions of nature, at three different times, masses of the earth--whole ranges of mountains, probably--have flown off into space, thuslessening the diameter of the earth, and changing the exact locality ofits centre by a point or two. This is a very curious and interestingcircumstance, and is a withering rebuke to those philosophers who wouldmake us believe that it is not possible for any portion of the earth tofly off into space.
To satisfy himself that this spot was really the centre of the earth, asceptic once paid well for the privilege of ascending to the dome of thechurch to see if the sun gave him a shadow at noon. He came downperfectly convinced. The day was very cloudy and the sun threw noshadows at all; but the man was satisfied that if the sun had come outand made shadows it could not have made any for him. Proofs like theseare not to be set aside by the idle tongues of cavilers. To such as arenot bigoted, and are willing to be convinced, they carry a convictionthat nothing can ever shake.
If even greater proofs than those I have mentioned are wanted, to satisfythe headstrong and the foolish that this is the genuine centre of theearth, they are here. The greatest of them lies in the fact that fromunder this very column was taken the dust from which Adam was made. Thiscan surely be regarded in the light of a settler. It is not likely thatthe original first man would have been made from an inferior quality ofearth when it was entirely convenient to get first quality from theworld's centre. This will strike any reflecting mind forcibly. ThatAdam was formed of dirt procured in this very spot is amply proven by thefact that in six thousand years no man has ever been able to prove thatthe dirt was not procured here whereof he was made.
It is a singular circumstance that right under the roof of this samegreat church, and not far away from that illustrious column, Adamhimself, the father of the human race, lies buried. There is no questionthat he is actually buried in the grave which is pointed out as his--there can be none--because it has never yet been proven that that graveis not the grave in which he is buried.
The tomb of Adam! How touching it was, here in a land of strangers, faraway from home, and friends, and all who cared for me, thus to discoverthe grave of a blood relation. True, a distant one, but still arelation. The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recognition. Thefountain of my filial affection was stirred to its profoundest depths,and I gave way to tumultuous emotion. I leaned upon a pillar and burstinto tears. I deem it no shame to have wept over the grave of my poordead relative. Let him who would sneer at my emotion close this volumehere, for he will find little to his taste in my journeyings through HolyLand. Noble old man--he did not live to see me--he did not live to seehis child. And I--I--alas, I did not live to see him. Weighed down bysorrow and disappointment, he died before I was born--six thousand briefsummers before I was born. But let us try to bear it with fortitude.Let us trust that he is better off where he is. Let us take comfort inthe thought that his loss is our eternal gain.
The next place the guide took us to in the holy church was an altardedicated to the Roman soldier who was of the military guard thatattended at the Crucifixion to keep order, and who--when the vail of theTemple was rent in the awful darkness that followed; when the rock ofGolgotha was split asunder by an earthquake; when the artillery of heaventhundered, and in the baleful glare of the lightnings the shrouded deadflitted about the streets of Jerusalem--shook with fear and said, "Surelythis was the Son of God!" Where this altar stands now, that Romansoldier stood then, in full view of the crucified Saviour--in full sightand hearing of all the marvels that were transpiring far and wide aboutthe circumference of the Hill of Calvary. And in this self-same spot thepriests of the Temple beheaded him for those blasphemous words he hadspoken.
In this altar they used to keep one of the most curious relics that humaneyes ever looked upon--a thing that had power to fascinate the beholderin some mysterious way and keep him gazing for hours together. It wasnothing less than the copper plate Pilate put upon the Saviour's cross,and upon which he wrote, "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS." I think St.Helena, the mother of Constantine, found this wonderful memento when shewas here in the third century. She traveled all over Palestine, and wasalways fortunate. Whenever the good old enthusiast found a thingmentioned in her Bible, Old or New, she would go and search for thatthing, and never stop until she found it. If it was Adam, she would findAdam; if it was the Ark, she would find the Ark; if it was Goliath, orJoshua, she would find them. She found the inscription here that I wasspeaking of, I think. She found it in this very spot, close to where themartyred Roman soldier stood. That copper plate is in one of thechurches in Rome, now. Any one can see it there. The inscription isvery distinct.
We passed along a few steps and saw the altar built over the very spotwhere the good Catholic priests say the soldiers divided the raiment ofthe Saviour.
Then we went down into a cavern which cavilers say was once a cistern.It is a chapel, now, however--the Chapel of St. Helena. It is fifty-onefeet long by forty-three wide. In it is a marble chair which Helena usedto sit in while she superintended her workmen when they were digging anddelving for the True Cross. In this place is an altar dedicated to St.Dimas, the penitent thief. A new bronze statue is here--a statue of St.Helena. It reminded us of poor Maximilian, so lately shot. He presentedit to this chapel when he was about to leave for his throne in Mexico.
From the cistern we descended twelve steps into a large roughly-shapedgrotto, carved wholly out of the living rock. Helena blasted it out whenshe was searching for the true Cross. She had a laborious piece of work,here, but it was richly rewarded. Out of this place she got the crown ofthorns, the nails of the cross, the true Cross itself, and the cross ofthe penitent thief. When she thought she had found every thing and wasabout to stop, she was told in a dream to continue a day longer. It wasvery fortunate. She did so, and found the cross of the other thief.
The walls and roof of this grotto still weep bitter tears in memory ofthe event that transpired on Calvary, and devout pilgrims groan and sobwhen these sad tears fall upon them from the dripping rock. The monkscall this apartment the "Chapel of the Invention of the Cross"--a namewhich is unfortunate, because it leads the ignorant to imagine that atacit acknowledgment is thus made that the tradition that Helena foundthe true Cross here is a fiction--an invention. It is a happiness toknow, however, that intelligent people do not doubt the story in any ofits particulars.
Priests of any of the chapels and denominations in the Church of the HolySepulchre can visit this sacred grotto to weep and pray and worship thegentle Redeemer. Two different congregations are not allowed to enter atthe same time, however, because they always fight.
Still marching through the venerable Church of the Holy Sepulchre, amongchanting priests in coarse long robes and sandals; pilgrims of all colorsand many nationalities, in all sorts of strange costumes; under duskyarches and by dingy piers and columns; through a sombre cathedral gloomfreighted with smoke and incense, and faintly starred with scores ofcandles that appeared suddenly and as suddenly disappeared, or driftedmysteriously hither and thither about the distant aisles like ghostlyjack-o'-lanterns--we came at last to a small chapel which is called the"Chapel of the Mocking." Under the altar was a fragment of a marblecolumn; this was the seat Christ sat on when he was reviled, andmockingly made King, crowned with a crown of thorns and sceptred with areed. It was here that they blindfolded him and struck him, and said inderision, "Prophesy who it is that smote thee." The tradition that thisis the identical spot of the mocking is a very ancient one. The guidesaid that Saewulf was the first to mention it. I do not know Saewulf,but still, I cannot well refuse to receive his evidence--none of us can.
They showed us where the great Godfrey and his brother Baldwin, the firstChristian Kings of Jerusalem, once lay buried by that sacred sepulchrethey had fought so long and so valiantly to wrest from the hands of theinfidel. But the niches that had contained the ashes of these renownedcrusaders were empty. Even the coverings of their tombs were gone--destroyed by devout members of the Greek Church, because Godfrey andBaldwin were Latin princes, and had been reared in a Christian faithwhose creed differed in some unimportant respects from theirs.
We passed on, and halted before the tomb of Melchisedek! You willremember Melchisedek, no doubt; he was the King who came out and levied atribute on Abraham the time that he pursued Lot's captors to Dan, andtook all their property from them. That was about four thousand yearsago, and Melchisedek died shortly afterward. However, his tomb is in agood state of preservation.
When one enters the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Sepulchre itself isthe first thing he desires to see, and really is almost the first thinghe does see. The next thing he has a strong yearning to see is the spotwhere the Saviour was crucified. But this they exhibit last. It is thecrowning glory of the place. One is grave and thoughtful when he standsin the little Tomb of the Saviour--he could not well be otherwise in sucha place--but he has not the slightest possible belief that ever the Lordlay there, and so the interest he feels in the spot is very, very greatlymarred by that reflection. He looks at the place where Mary stood, inanother part of the church, and where John stood, and Mary Magdalen;where the mob derided the Lord; where the angel sat; where the crown ofthorns was found, and the true Cross; where the risen Saviour appeared--he looks at all these places with interest, but with the same convictionhe felt in the case of the Sepulchre, that there is nothing genuine aboutthem, and that they are imaginary holy places created by the monks. Butthe place of the Crucifixion affects him differently. He fully believesthat he is looking upon the very spot where the Savior gave up hislife. He remembers that Christ was very celebrated, long before he cameto Jerusalem; he knows that his fame was so great that crowds followedhim all the time; he is aware that his entry into the city produced astirring sensation, and that his reception was a kind of ovation; he cannot overlook the fact that when he was crucified there were very many inJerusalem who believed that he was the true Son of God. To publiclyexecute such a personage was sufficient in itself to make the locality ofthe execution a memorable place for ages; added to this, the storm, thedarkness, the earthquake, the rending of the vail of the Temple, and theuntimely waking of the dead, were events calculated to fix the executionand the scene of it in the memory of even the most thoughtless witness.Fathers would tell their sons about the strange affair, and point out thespot; the sons would transmit the story to their children, and thus aperiod of three hundred years would easily be spanned--[The thought isMr. Prime's, not mine, and is full of good sense. I borrowed it from his"Tent Life."--M. T.]--at which time Helena came and built a church uponCalvary to commemorate the death and burial of the Lord and preserve thesacred place in the memories of men; since that time there has alwaysbeen a church there. It is not possible that there can be any mistakeabout the locality of the Crucifixion. Not half a dozen persons knewwhere they buried the Saviour, perhaps, and a burial is not a startlingevent, any how; therefore, we can be pardoned for unbelief in theSepulchre, but not in the place of the Crucifixion. Five hundred yearshence there will be no vestige of Bunker Hill Monument left, but Americawill still know where the battle was fought and where Warren fell. Thecrucifixion of Christ was too notable an event in Jerusalem, and the Hillof Calvary made too celebrated by it, to be forgotten in the short spaceof three hundred years. I climbed the stairway in the church whichbrings one to the top of the small inclosed pinnacle of rock, and lookedupon the place where the true cross once stood, with a far more absorbinginterest than I had ever felt in any thing earthly before. I could notbelieve that the three holes in the top of the rock were the actual onesthe crosses stood in, but I felt satisfied that those crosses had stoodso near the place now occupied by them, that the few feet of possibledifference were a matter of no consequence.
When one stands where the Saviour was crucified, he finds it all he cando to keep it strictly before his mind that Christ was not crucified in aCatholic Church. He must remind himself every now and then that thegreat event transpired in the open air, and not in a gloomy,candle-lighted cell in a little corner of a vast church, up-stairs--a small cell all bejeweled and bespangled with flashy ornamentation,in execrable taste.
Under a marble altar like a table, is a circular hole in the marblefloor, corresponding with the one just under it in which the true Crossstood. The first thing every one does is to kneel down and take a candleand examine this hole. He does this strange prospecting with an amountof gravity that can never be estimated or appreciated by a man who hasnot seen the operation. Then he holds his candle before a richlyengraved picture of the Saviour, done on a messy slab of gold, andwonderfully rayed and starred with diamonds, which hangs above the holewithin the altar, and his solemnity changes to lively admiration. Herises and faces the finely wrought figures of the Saviour and themalefactors uplifted upon their crosses behind the altar, and bright witha metallic lustre of many colors. He turns next to the figures close tothem of the Virgin and Mary Magdalen; next to the rift in the living rockmade by the earthquake at the time of the Crucifixion, and an extensionof which he had seen before in the wall of one of the grottoes below; helooks next at the show-case with a figure of the Virgin in it, and isamazed at the princely fortune in precious gems and jewelry that hangs sothickly about the form as to hide it like a garment almost. All aboutthe apartment the gaudy trappings of the Greek Church offend the eye andkeep the mind on the rack to remember that this is the Place of theCrucifixion--Golgotha--the Mount of Calvary. And the last thing he looksat is that which was also the first--the place where the true Crossstood. That will chain him to the spot and compel him to look once more,and once again, after he has satisfied all curiosity and lost allinterest concerning the other matters pertaining to the locality.
And so I close my chapter on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre--the mostsacred locality on earth to millions and millions of men, and women, andchildren, the noble and the humble, bond and free. In its history fromthe first, and in its tremendous associations, it is the most illustriousedifice in Christendom. With all its clap-trap side-shows and unseemlyimpostures of every kind, it is still grand, reverend, venerable--for agod died there; for fifteen hundred years its shrines have been wet withthe tears of pilgrims from the earth's remotest confines; for more thantwo hundred, the most gallant knights that ever wielded sword wastedtheir lives away in a struggle to seize it and hold it sacred frominfidel pollution. Even in our own day a war, that cost millions oftreasure and rivers of blood, was fought because two rival nationsclaimed the sole right to put a new dome upon it. History is full ofthis old Church of the Holy Sepulchre--full of blood that was shedbecause of the respect and the veneration in which men held the lastresting-place of the meek and lowly, the mild and gentle, Prince ofPeace!
