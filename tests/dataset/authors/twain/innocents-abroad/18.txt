All day long we sped through a mountainous country whose peaks werebright with sunshine, whose hillsides were dotted with pretty villassitting in the midst of gardens and shrubbery, and whose deep ravineswere cool and shady and looked ever so inviting from where we and thebirds were winging our flight through the sultry upper air.
We had plenty of chilly tunnels wherein to check our perspiration,though. We timed one of them. We were twenty minutes passing throughit, going at the rate of thirty to thirty-five miles an hour.
Beyond Alessandria we passed the battle-field of Marengo.
Toward dusk we drew near Milan and caught glimpses of the city and theblue mountain peaks beyond. But we were not caring for these things--they did not interest us in the least. We were in a fever of impatience;we were dying to see the renowned cathedral! We watched--in thisdirection and that--all around--everywhere. We needed no one to point itout--we did not wish any one to point it out--we would recognize it evenin the desert of the great Sahara.
At last, a forest of graceful needles, shimmering in the amber sunlight,rose slowly above the pygmy housetops, as one sometimes sees, in the farhorizon, a gilded and pinnacled mass of cloud lift itself above the wasteof waves, at sea,--the Cathedral! We knew it in a moment.
Half of that night, and all of the next day, this architectural autocratwas our sole object of interest.
What a wonder it is! So grand, so solemn, so vast! And yet so delicate,so airy, so graceful! A very world of solid weight, and yet it seems inthe soft moonlight only a fairy delusion of frost-work that might vanishwith a breath! How sharply its pinnacled angles and its wilderness ofspires were cut against the sky, and how richly their shadows fell uponits snowy roof! It was a vision!--a miracle!--an anthem sung in stone, apoem wrought in marble!
Howsoever you look at the great cathedral, it is noble, it is beautiful!Wherever you stand in Milan or within seven miles of Milan, it is visibleand when it is visible, no other object can chain your whole attention.Leave your eyes unfettered by your will but a single instant and theywill surely turn to seek it. It is the first thing you look for when yourise in the morning, and the last your lingering gaze rests upon atnight. Surely it must be the princeliest creation that ever brain of manconceived.
At nine o'clock in the morning we went and stood before this marblecolossus. The central one of its five great doors is bordered with abas-relief of birds and fruits and beasts and insects, which have been soingeniously carved out of the marble that they seem like livingcreatures--and the figures are so numerous and the design so complex thatone might study it a week without exhausting its interest. On the greatsteeple--surmounting the myriad of spires--inside of the spires--over thedoors, the windows--in nooks and corners--every where that a niche or aperch can be found about the enormous building, from summit to base,there is a marble statue, and every statue is a study in itself!Raphael, Angelo, Canova--giants like these gave birth to the designs, andtheir own pupils carved them. Every face is eloquent with expression,and every attitude is full of grace. Away above, on the lofty roof, rankon rank of carved and fretted spires spring high in the air, and throughtheir rich tracery one sees the sky beyond. In their midst the centralsteeple towers proudly up like the mainmast of some great Indiaman amonga fleet of coasters.
We wished to go aloft. The sacristan showed us a marble stairway (ofcourse it was marble, and of the purest and whitest--there is no otherstone, no brick, no wood, among its building materials) and told us to goup one hundred and eighty-two steps and stop till he came. It was notnecessary to say stop--we should have done that any how. We were tiredby the time we got there. This was the roof. Here, springing from itsbroad marble flagstones, were the long files of spires, looking very tallclose at hand, but diminishing in the distance like the pipes of anorgan. We could see now that the statue on the top of each was the sizeof a large man, though they all looked like dolls from the street. Wecould see, also, that from the inside of each and every one of thesehollow spires, from sixteen to thirty-one beautiful marble statues lookedout upon the world below.
From the eaves to the comb of the roof stretched in endless successiongreat curved marble beams, like the fore-and-aft braces of a steamboat,and along each beam from end to end stood up a row of richly carvedflowers and fruits--each separate and distinct in kind, and over 15,000species represented. At a little distance these rows seem to closetogether like the ties of a railroad track, and then the minglingtogether of the buds and blossoms of this marble garden forms a picturethat is very charming to the eye.
We descended and entered. Within the church, long rows of flutedcolumns, like huge monuments, divided the building into broad aisles, andon the figured pavement fell many a soft blush from the painted windowsabove. I knew the church was very large, but I could not fullyappreciate its great size until I noticed that the men standing far downby the altar looked like boys, and seemed to glide, rather than walk. Weloitered about gazing aloft at the monster windows all aglow withbrilliantly colored scenes in the lives of the Saviour and his followers.Some of these pictures are mosaics, and so artistically are theirthousand particles of tinted glass or stone put together that the workhas all the smoothness and finish of a painting. We counted sixty panesof glass in one window, and each pane was adorned with one of thesemaster achievements of genius and patience.
The guide showed us a coffee-colored piece of sculpture which he said wasconsidered to have come from the hand of Phidias, since it was notpossible that any other artist, of any epoch, could have copied naturewith such faultless accuracy. The figure was that of a man without askin; with every vein, artery, muscle, every fiber and tendon and tissueof the human frame represented in minute detail. It looked natural,because somehow it looked as if it were in pain. A skinned man would belikely to look that way unless his attention were occupied with someother matter. It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascinationabout it some where. I am very sorry I saw it, because I shall alwayssee it now. I shall dream of it sometimes. I shall dream that it isresting its corded arms on the bed's head and looking down on me with itsdead eyes; I shall dream that it is stretched between the sheets with meand touching me with its exposed muscles and its stringy cold legs.
It is hard to forget repulsive things. I remember yet how I ran off fromschool once, when I was a boy, and then, pretty late at night, concludedto climb into the window of my father's office and sleep on a lounge,because I had a delicacy about going home and getting thrashed. As I layon the lounge and my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, I fancied Icould see a long, dusky, shapeless thing stretched upon the floor. Acold shiver went through me. I turned my face to the wall. That did notanswer. I was afraid that that thing would creep over and seize me inthe dark. I turned back and stared at it for minutes and minutes--theyseemed hours. It appeared to me that the lagging moonlight never, neverwould get to it. I turned to the wall and counted twenty, to pass thefeverish time away. I looked--the pale square was nearer. I turnedagain and counted fifty--it was almost touching it. With desperate willI turned again and counted one hundred, and faced about, all in atremble. A white human hand lay in the moonlight! Such an awful sinkingat the heart--such a sudden gasp for breath! I felt--I cannot tell whatI felt. When I recovered strength enough, I faced the wall again. Butno boy could have remained so with that mysterious hand behind him. Icounted again and looked--the most of a naked arm was exposed. I put myhands over my eyes and counted till I could stand it no longer, and then--the pallid face of a man was there, with the corners of the mouth drawndown, and the eyes fixed and glassy in death! I raised to a sittingposture and glowered on that corpse till the light crept down the barebreastline by line--inch by inch--past the nipple--and then it discloseda ghastly stab!
I went away from there. I do not say that I went away in any sort of ahurry, but I simply went--that is sufficient. I went out at the window,and I carried the sash along with me. I did not need the sash, but itwas handier to take it than it was to leave it, and so I took it.--I wasnot scared, but I was considerably agitated.
When I reached home, they whipped me, but I enjoyed it. It seemedperfectly delightful. That man had been stabbed near the office thatafternoon, and they carried him in there to doctor him, but he only livedan hour. I have slept in the same room with him often since then--in mydreams.
Now we will descend into the crypt, under the grand altar of MilanCathedral, and receive an impressive sermon from lips that have beensilent and hands that have been gestureless for three hundred years.
The priest stopped in a small dungeon and held up his candle. This wasthe last resting-place of a good man, a warm-hearted, unselfish man; aman whose whole life was given to succoring the poor, encouraging thefaint-hearted, visiting the sick; in relieving distress, whenever andwherever he found it. His heart, his hand, and his purse were alwaysopen. With his story in one's mind he can almost see his benignantcountenance moving calmly among the haggard faces of Milan in the dayswhen the plague swept the city, brave where all others were cowards, fullof compassion where pity had been crushed out of all other breasts by theinstinct of self-preservation gone mad with terror, cheering all, prayingwith all, helping all, with hand and brain and purse, at a time whenparents forsook their children, the friend deserted the friend, and thebrother turned away from the sister while her pleadings were stillwailing in his ears.
This was good St. Charles Borromeo, Bishop of Milan. The people idolizedhim; princes lavished uncounted treasures upon him. We stood in histomb. Near by was the sarcophagus, lighted by the dripping candles. Thewalls were faced with bas-reliefs representing scenes in his life done inmassive silver. The priest put on a short white lace garment over hisblack robe, crossed himself, bowed reverently, and began to turn awindlass slowly. The sarcophagus separated in two parts, lengthwise, andthe lower part sank down and disclosed a coffin of rock crystal as clearas the atmosphere. Within lay the body, robed in costly habilimentscovered with gold embroidery and starred with scintillating gems. Thedecaying head was black with age, the dry skin was drawn tight to thebones, the eyes were gone, there was a hole in the temple and another inthe cheek, and the skinny lips were parted as in a ghastly smile! Overthis dreadful face, its dust and decay and its mocking grin, hung a crownsown thick with flashing brilliants; and upon the breast lay crosses andcroziers of solid gold that were splendid with emeralds and diamonds.
How poor, and cheap, and trivial these gew-gaws seemed in presence of thesolemnity, the grandeur, the awful majesty of Death! Think of Milton,Shakespeare, Washington, standing before a reverent world tricked out inthe glass beads, the brass ear-rings and tin trumpery of the savages ofthe plains!
Dead Bartolomeo preached his pregnant sermon, and its burden was: Youthat worship the vanities of earth--you that long for worldly honor,worldly wealth, worldly fame--behold their worth!
To us it seemed that so good a man, so kind a heart, so simple a nature,deserved rest and peace in a grave sacred from the intrusion of pryingeyes, and believed that he himself would have preferred to have it so,but peradventure our wisdom was at fault in this regard.
As we came out upon the floor of the church again, another priestvolunteered to show us the treasures of the church.
What, more? The furniture of the narrow chamber of death we had justvisited weighed six millions of francs in ounces and carats alone,without a penny thrown into the account for the costly workmanshipbestowed upon them! But we followed into a large room filled with tallwooden presses like wardrobes. He threw them open, and behold, thecargoes of "crude bullion" of the assay offices of Nevada faded out of mymemory. There were Virgins and bishops there, above their natural size,made of solid silver, each worth, by weight, from eight hundred thousandto two millions of francs, and bearing gemmed books in their hands wortheighty thousand; there were bas-reliefs that weighed six hundred pounds,carved in solid silver; croziers and crosses, and candlesticks six andeight feet high, all of virgin gold, and brilliant with precious stones;and beside these were all manner of cups and vases, and such things, richin proportion. It was an Aladdin's palace. The treasures here, bysimple weight, without counting workmanship, were valued at fiftymillions of francs! If I could get the custody of them for a while, Ifear me the market price of silver bishops would advance shortly, onaccount of their exceeding scarcity in the Cathedral of Milan.
The priests showed us two of St. Paul's fingers, and one of St. Peter's;a bone of Judas Iscariot, (it was black,) and also bones of all the otherdisciples; a handkerchief in which the Saviour had left the impression ofhis face. Among the most precious of the relics were a stone from theHoly Sepulchre, part of the crown of thorns, (they have a whole one atNotre Dame,) a fragment of the purple robe worn by the Saviour, a nailfrom the Cross, and a picture of the Virgin and Child painted by theveritable hand of St. Luke. This is the second of St. Luke's Virgins wehave seen. Once a year all these holy relics are carried in processionthrough the streets of Milan.
I like to revel in the dryest details of the great cathedral. Thebuilding is five hundred feet long by one hundred and eighty wide, andthe principal steeple is in the neighborhood of four hundred feet high.It has 7,148 marble statues, and will have upwards of three thousand morewhen it is finished. In addition it has one thousand five hundredbas-reliefs. It has one hundred and thirty-six spires--twenty-one moreare to be added. Each spire is surmounted by a statue six and a halffeet high. Every thing about the church is marble, and all from thesame quarry; it was bequeathed to the Archbishopric for this purposecenturies ago. So nothing but the mere workmanship costs; still that isexpensive--the bill foots up six hundred and eighty-four millions offrancs thus far (considerably over a hundred millions of dollars,) andit is estimated that it will take a hundred and twenty years yet tofinish the cathedral. It looks complete, but is far from being so. Wesaw a new statue put in its niche yesterday, alongside of one which hadbeen standing these four hundred years, they said. There are fourstaircases leading up to the main steeple, each of which cost a hundredthousand dollars, with the four hundred and eight statues which adornthem. Marco Compioni was the architect who designed the wonderfulstructure more than five hundred years ago, and it took him forty-sixyears to work out the plan and get it ready to hand over to thebuilders. He is dead now. The building was begun a little less thanfive hundred years ago, and the third generation hence will not see itcompleted.
The building looks best by moonlight, because the older portions of it,being stained with age, contrast unpleasantly with the newer and whiterportions. It seems somewhat too broad for its height, but may befamiliarity with it might dissipate this impression.
They say that the Cathedral of Milan is second only to St. Peter's atRome. I cannot understand how it can be second to anything made by humanhands.
We bid it good-bye, now--possibly for all time. How surely, in somefuture day, when the memory of it shall have lost its vividness, shall wehalf believe we have seen it in a wonderful dream, but never with wakingeyes!
