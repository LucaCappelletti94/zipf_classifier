CHAPTER XXX [Harris Climbs Mountains for Me]
An hour's sail brought us to Lucerne again. I judged it best to go tobed and rest several days, for I knew that the man who undertakes tomake the tour of Europe on foot must take care of himself.
Thinking over my plans, as mapped out, I perceived that they did nottake in the Furka Pass, the Rhone Glacier, the Finsteraarhorn, theWetterhorn, etc. I immediately examined the guide-book to see if thesewere important, and found they were; in fact, a pedestrian tour ofEurope could not be complete without them. Of course that decided me atonce to see them, for I never allow myself to do things by halves, or ina slurring, slipshod way.
I called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make acareful examination of these noted places, on foot, and bring me back awritten report of the result, for insertion in my book. I instructedhim to go to Hospenthal as quickly as possible, and make his grand startfrom there; to extend his foot expedition as far as the Giesbach fall,and return to me from thence by diligence or mule. I told him to takethe courier with him.
He objected to the courier, and with some show of reason, since he wasabout to venture upon new and untried ground; but I thought he mightas well learn how to take care of the courier now as later, therefore Ienforced my point. I said that the trouble, delay, and inconvenienceof traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which acourier's presence commands, and I must insist that as much style bethrown into my journeys as possible.
So the two assumed complete mountaineering costumes and departed. A weeklater they returned, pretty well used up, and my agent handed me thefollowing:
Official Report
OF A VISIT TO THE FURKA REGION. BY H. HARRIS, AGENT
About seven o'clock in the morning, with perfectly fine weather, westarted from Hospenthal, and arrived at the MAISON on the Furka ina little under QUATRE hours. The want of variety in the sceneryfrom Hospenthal made the KAHKAHPONEEKA wearisome; but let none bediscouraged; no one can fail to be completely R'ECOMPENS'EE for hisfatigue, when he sees, for the first time, the monarch of the Oberland,the tremendous Finsteraarhorn. A moment before all was dullness, buta PAS further has placed us on the summit of the Furka; and exactly infront of us, at a HOPOW of only fifteen miles, this magnificent mountainlifts its snow-wreathed precipices into the deep blue sky. The inferiormountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the pictureof their dread lord, and close in the view so completely that no otherprominent feature in the Oberland is visible from this BONG-A-BONG;nothing withdraws the attention from the solitary grandeur of theFinsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form the abutments of thecentral peak.
With the addition of some others, who were also bound for the Grimsel,we formed a large XHVLOJ as we descended the STEG which winds round theshoulder of a mountain toward the Rhone Glacier. We soon left the pathand took to the ice; and after wandering amongst the crevices UN PEU, toadmire the wonders of these deep blue caverns, and hear the rushing ofwaters through their subglacial channels, we struck out a course towardL'AUTRE CÃ”TE and crossed the glacier successfully, a little above thecave from which the infant Rhone takes its first bound from under thegrand precipice of ice. Half a mile below this we began to climb theflowery side of the Meienwand. One of our party started before the rest,but the HITZE was so great, that we found IHM quite exhausted, and lyingat full length in the shade of a large GESTEIN. We sat down with himfor a time, for all felt the heat exceedingly in the climb up this verysteep BOLWOGGOLY, and then we set out again together, and arrived atlast near the Dead Man's Lake, at the foot of the Sidelhorn. This lonelyspot, once used for an extempore burying-place, after a sanguinaryBATTUE between the French and Austrians, is the perfection ofdesolation; there is nothing in sight to mark the hand of man, exceptthe line of weather-beaten whitened posts, set up to indicate thedirection of the pass in the OWDAWAKK of winter. Near this point thefootpath joins the wider track, which connects the Grimsel with the headof the Rhone SCHNAWP; this has been carefully constructed, and leadswith a tortuous course among and over LES PIERRES, down to the bank ofthe gloomy little SWOSH-SWOSH, which almost washes against the walls ofthe Grimsel Hospice. We arrived a little before four o'clock at the endof our day's journey, hot enough to justify the step, taking by most ofthe PARTIE, of plunging into the crystal water of the snow-fed lake.
The next afternoon we started for a walk up the Unteraar glacier, withthe intention of, at all events, getting as far as the HUETTE which isused as a sleeping-place by most of those who cross the Strahleck Passto Grindelwald. We got over the tedious collection of stones and DE'BRISwhich covers the PIED of the GLETCHER, and had walked nearly three hoursfrom the Grimsel, when, just as we were thinking of crossing over to theright, to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut, the clouds, which hadfor some time assumed a threatening appearance, suddenly dropped, anda huge mass of them, driving toward us from the Finsteraarhorn, poureddown a deluge of HABOOLONG and hail. Fortunately, we were not far froma very large glacier-table; it was a huge rock balanced on a pedestalof ice high enough to admit of our all creeping under it for GOWKARAK.A stream of PUCKITTYPUKK had furrowed a course for itself in the iceat its base, and we were obliged to stand with one FUSS on each side ofthis, and endeavor to keep ourselves CHAUD by cutting steps in the steepbank of the pedestal, so as to get a higher place for standing on,as the WASSER rose rapidly in its trench. A very cold BZZZZZZZZEEEaccompanied the storm, and made our position far from pleasant; andpresently came a flash of BLITZEN, apparently in the middle of ourlittle party, with an instantaneous clap of YOKKY, sounding like a largegun fired close to our ears; the effect was startling; but in a fewseconds our attention was fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunderagainst the tremendous mountains which completely surrounded us. Thiswas followed by many more bursts, none of WELCHE, however, was sodangerously near; and after waiting a long DEMI-hour in our icy prison,we sallied out to talk through a HABOOLONG which, though not so heavyas before, was quite enough to give us a thorough soaking before ourarrival at the Hospice.
The Grimsel is CERTAINEMENT a wonderful place; situated at the bottomof a sort of huge crater, the sides of which are utterly savage GEBIRGE,composed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single pine ARBRE,and afford only scanty food for a herd of GMWKWLLOLP, it looks as ifit must be completely BEGRABEN in the winter snows. Enormous avalanchesfall against it every spring, sometimes covering everything to the depthof thirty or forty feet; and, in spite of walls four feet thick, andfurnished with outside shutters, the two men who stay here when theVOYAGEURS are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you thatthe snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations.
Next morning the HOGGLEBUMGULLUP still continued bad, but we made up ourminds to go on, and make the best of it. Half an hour after we started,the REGEN thickened unpleasantly, and we attempted to get shelter undera projecting rock, but being far to NASS already to make standing at allAGRE'ABLE, we pushed on for the Handeck, consoling ourselves with thereflection that from the furious rushing of the river Aar at ourside, we should at all events see the celebrated WASSERFALL in GRANDEPERFECTION. Nor were we NAPPERSOCKET in our expectation; the waterwas roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a mostmagnificent frenzy, while the trees which cling to its rocky sidesswayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought downwith it; even the stream, which falls into the main cascade at rightangles, and TOUTEFOIS forms a beautiful feature in the scene, was nowswollen into a raging torrent; and the violence of this "meeting of thewaters," about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood, wasfearfully grand. While we were looking at it, GLUECKLICHEWEISE a gleamof sunshine came out, and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed bythe spray, and hung in mid-air suspended over the awful gorge.
On going into the CHALET above the fall, we were informed that a BRUECKEhad broken down near Guttanen, and that it would be impossible toproceed for some time; accordingly we were kept in our drenchedcondition for EIN STUNDE, when some VOYAGEURS arrived from Meiringen,and told us that there had been a trifling accident, ABER that we couldnow cross. On arriving at the spot, I was much inclined to suspect thatthe whole story was a ruse to make us SLOWWK and drink the more at theHandeck Inn, for only a few planks had been carried away, and thoughthere might perhaps have been some difficulty with mules, the gap wascertainly not larger than a MMBGLX might cross with a very slight leap.Near Guttanen the HABOOLONG happily ceased, and we had time to walkourselves tolerably dry before arriving at Reichenback, WO we enjoyed agood DINE' at the Hotel des Alps.
Next morning we walked to Rosenlaui, the BEAU ID'EAL of Swiss scenery,where we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier.This was more beautiful than words can describe, for in the constantprogress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formeda vast cavern, as blue as the sky above, and rippled like a frozenocean. A few steps cut in the WHOOPJAMBOREEHOO enabled us to walkcompletely under this, and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliestobjects in creation. The glacier was all around divided by numberlessfissures of the same exquisite color, and the finest wood-ERDBEEREN weregrowing in abundance but a few yards from the ice. The inn stands ina CHARMANT spot close to the CÃ”TE DE LA RIVIÃˆRE, which, lower down,forms the Reichenbach fall, and embosomed in the richest of pine woods,while the fine form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it completes theenchanting BOPPLE. In the afternoon we walked over the Great Scheideckto Grindelwald, stopping to pay a visit to the Upper glacier by the way;but we were again overtaken by bad HOGGLEBUMGULLUP and arrived at thehotel in a SOLCHE a state that the landlord's wardrobe was in greatrequest.
The clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst, for a lovelyday succeeded, which we determined to devote to an ascent of theFaulhorn. We left Grindelwald just as a thunder-storm was dying away,and we hoped to find GUTEN WETTER up above; but the rain, which hadnearly ceased, began again, and we were struck by the rapidly increasingFROID as we ascended. Two-thirds of the way up were completed whenthe rain was exchanged for GNILLIC, with which the BODEN was thicklycovered, and before we arrived at the top the GNILLIC and mist becameso thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty POOPOOdistance, and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough andthickly covered ground. Shivering with cold, we turned into bed with adouble allowance of clothes, and slept comfortably while the windhowled AUTOUR DE LA MAISON; when I awoke, the wall and the window lookedequally dark, but in another hour I found I could just see the formof the latter; so I jumped out of bed, and forced it open, though withgreat difficulty from the frost and the quantities of GNILLIC heaped upagainst it.
A row of huge icicles hung down from the edge of the roof, and anythingmore wintry than the whole ANBLICK could not well be imagined; but thesudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startlingthat I felt no inclination to move toward bed again. The snow whichhad collected upon LA FENÃŠTRE had increased the FINSTERNISS ODER DERDUNKELHEIT, so that when I looked out I was surprised to find that thedaylight was considerable, and that the BALRAGOOMAH would evidently risebefore long. Only the brightest of LES Ã‰TOILES were still shining; thesky was cloudless overhead, though small curling mists lay thousands offeet below us in the valleys, wreathed around the feet of the mountains,and adding to the splendor of their lofty summits. We were soon dressedand out of the house, watching the gradual approach of dawn, thoroughlyabsorbed in the first near view of the Oberland giants, which brokeupon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the evening before."KABAUGWAKKO SONGWASHEE KUM WETTERHORN SNAWPO!" cried some one, as thatgrand summit gleamed with the first rose of dawn; and in a few momentsthe double crest of the Schreckhorn followed its example; peak afterpeak seemed warmed with life, the Jungfrau blushed even more beautifullythan her neighbors, and soon, from the Wetterhorn in the east to theWildstrubel in the west, a long row of fires glowed upon mighty altars,truly worthy of the gods. The WLGW was very severe; our sleeping-placecould hardly be DISTINGUEE' from the snow around it, which had fallento a depth of a FLIRK during the past evening, and we heartily enjoyed arough scramble EN BAS to the Giesbach falls, where we soon found a warmclimate. At noon the day before Grindelwald the thermometer couldnot have stood at less than 100 degrees Fahr. in the sun; and in theevening, judging from the icicles formed, and the state of the windows,there must have been at least twelve DINGBLATTER of frost, thus giving achange of 80 degrees during a few hours.
I said:
"You have done well, Harris; this report is concise, compact, wellexpressed; the language is crisp, the descriptions are vivid and notneedlessly elaborated; your report goes straight to the point, attendsstrictly to business, and doesn't fool around. It is in many ways anexcellent document. But it has a fault--it is too learned, it is muchtoo learned. What is 'DINGBLATTER'?
"'DINGBLATTER' is a Fiji word meaning 'degrees.'"
"You knew the English of it, then?"
"Oh, yes."
"What is 'GNILLIC'?
"That is the Eskimo term for 'snow.'"
"So you knew the English for that, too?"
"Why, certainly."
"What does 'MMBGLX' stand for?"
"That is Zulu for 'pedestrian.'"
"'While the form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it completes theenchanting BOPPLE.' What is 'BOPPLE'?"
"'Picture.' It's Choctaw."
"What is 'SCHNAWP'?"
"'Valley.' That is Choctaw, also."
"What is 'BOLWOGGOLY'?"
"That is Chinese for 'hill.'"
"'KAHKAHPONEEKA'?"
"'Ascent.' Choctaw."
"'But we were again overtaken by bad HOGGLEBUMGULLUP.' What does'HOGGLEBUMGULLUP' mean?"
"That is Chinese for 'weather.'"
"Is 'HOGGLEBUMGULLUP' better than the English word? Is it any moredescriptive?"
"No, it means just the same."
"And 'DINGBLATTER' and 'GNILLIC,' and 'BOPPLE,' and 'SCHNAWP'--are theybetter than the English words?"
"No, they mean just what the English ones do."
"Then why do you use them? Why have you used all this Chinese andChoctaw and Zulu rubbish?"
"Because I didn't know any French but two or three words, and I didn'tknow any Latin or Greek at all."
"That is nothing. Why should you want to use foreign words, anyhow?"
"They adorn my page. They all do it."
"Who is 'all'?"
"Everybody. Everybody that writes elegantly. Anybody has a right to thatwants to."
"I think you are mistaken." I then proceeded in the following scathingmanner. "When really learned men write books for other learned mento read, they are justified in using as many learned words as theyplease--their audience will understand them; but a man who writes a bookfor the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pageswith untranslated foreign expressions. It is an insolence toward themajority of the purchasers, for it is a very frank and impudent way ofsaying, 'Get the translations made yourself if you want them, thisbook is not written for the ignorant classes.' There are men who knowa foreign language so well and have used it so long in their dailylife that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their Englishwritings unconsciously, and so they omit to translate, as much ashalf the time. That is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the man'sreaders. What is the excuse for this? The writer would say he only usesthe foreign language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyedin English. Very well, then he writes his best things for the tenth man,and he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book. However, theexcuse he offers is at least an excuse; but there is another set ofmen who are like YOU; they know a WORD here and there, of a foreignlanguage, or a few beggarly little three-word phrases, filched from theback of the Dictionary, and these are continually peppering into theirliterature, with a pretense of knowing that language--what excuse canthey offer? The foreign words and phrases which they use have theirexact equivalents in a nobler language--English; yet they think they'adorn their page' when they say STRASSE for street, and BAHNHOF forrailway-station, and so on--flaunting these fluttering rags of povertyin the reader's face and imagining he will be ass enough to takethem for the sign of untold riches held in reserve. I will let your'learning' remain in your report; you have as much right, I suppose, to'adorn your page' with Zulu and Chinese and Choctaw rubbish as others ofyour sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched fromhalf a dozen learned tongues whose A-B ABS they don't even know."
When the musing spider steps upon the red-hot shovel, he first exhibitsa wild surprise, then he shrivels up. Similar was the effect of theseblistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting Agent. I can bedreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me.
