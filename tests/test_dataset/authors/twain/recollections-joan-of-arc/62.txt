The Third Trial Fails
SO THE SECOND trial in the prison was over. Over, and no definite result.The character of it I have described to you. It was baser in oneparticular than the previous one; for this time the charges had not beencommunicated to Joan, therefore she had been obliged to fight in thedark.
There was no opportunity to do any thinking beforehand; there was noforeseeing what traps might be set, and no way to prepare for them. Trulyit was a shabby advantage to take of a girl situated as this one was. Oneday, during the course of it, an able lawyer of Normandy, Maetre Lohier,happened to be in Rouen, and I will give you his opinion of that trial,so that you may see that I have been honest with you, and that mypartisanship has not made me deceive you as to its unfair and illegalcharacter. Cauchon showed Lohier the proces and asked his opinion aboutthe trial. Now this was the opinion which he gave to Cauchon. He saidthat the whole thing was null and void; for these reasons: 1, because thetrial was secret, and full freedom of speech and action on the part ofthose present not possible; 2, because the trial touched the honor of theKing of France, yet he was not summoned to defend himself, nor any oneappointed to represent him; 3, because the charges against the prisonerwere not communicated to her; 4, because the accused, although young andsimple, had been forced to defend her cause without help of counsel,notwithstanding she had so much at stake.
Did that please Bishop Cauchon? It did not. He burst out upon Lohier withthe most savage cursings, and swore he would have him drowned. Lohierescaped from Rouen and got out of France with all speed, and so saved hislife.
Well, as I have said, the second trial was over, without definite result.But Cauchon did not give up. He could trump up another. And still anotherand another, if necessary. He had the half-promise of an enormousprize--the Archbishopric of Rouen--if he should succeed in burning thebody and damning to hell the soul of this young girl who had never donehim any harm; and such a prize as that, to a man like the Bishop ofBeauvais, was worth the burning and damning of fifty harmless girls, letalone one.
So he set to work again straight off next day; and with high confidence,too, intimating with brutal cheerfulness that he should succeed thistime. It took him and the other scavengers nine days to dig matter enoughout of Joan's testimony and their own inventions to build up the new massof charges. And it was a formidable mass indeed, for it numberedsixty-six articles.
This huge document was carried to the castle the next day, March 27th;and there, before a dozen carefully selected judges, the new trial wasbegun.
Opinions were taken, and the tribunal decided that Joan should hear thearticles read this time.
Maybe that was on account of Lohier's remark upon that head; or maybe itwas hoped that the reading would kill the prisoner with fatigue--for, asit turned out, this reading occupied several days. It was also decidedthat Joan should be required to answer squarely to every article, andthat if she refused she should be considered convicted. You see, Cauchonwas managing to narrow her chances more and more all the time; he wasdrawing the toils closer and closer.
Joan was brought in, and the Bishop of Beauvais opened with a speech toher which ought to have made even himself blush, so laden it was withhypocrisy and lies. He said that this court was composed of holy andpious churchmen whose hearts were full of benevolence and compassiontoward her, and that they had no wish to hurt her body, but only a desireto instruct her and lead her into the way of truth and salvation.
Why, this man was born a devil; now think of his describing himself andthose hardened slaves of his in such language as that.
And yet, worse was to come. For now having in mind another of Lovier'shints, he had the cold effrontery to make to Joan a proposition which, Ithink, will surprise you when you hear it. He said that this court,recognizing her untaught estate and her inability to deal with thecomplex and difficult matters which were about to be considered, haddetermined, out of their pity and their mercifulness, to allow her tochoose one or more persons out of their own number to help her withcounsel and advice!
Think of that--a court made up of Loyseleur and his breed of reptiles. Itwas granting leave to a lamb to ask help of a wolf. Joan looked up to seeif he was serious, and perceiving that he was at least pretending to be,she declined, of course.
The Bishop was not expecting any other reply. He had made a show offairness and could have it entered on the minutes, therefore he wassatisfied.
Then he commanded Joan to answer straitly to every accusation; andthreatened to cut her off from the Church if she failed to do that ordelayed her answers beyond a given length of time.
Yes, he was narrowing her chances down, step by step.
Thomas de Courcelles began the reading of that interminable document,article by article. Joan answered to each article in its turn; sometimesmerely denying its truth, sometimes by saying her answer would be foundin the records of the previous trials.
What a strange document that was, and what an exhibition and exposure ofthe heart of man, the one creature authorized to boast that he is made inthe image of God. To know Joan of Arc was to know one who was whollynoble, pure, truthful, brave, compassionate, generous, pious, unselfish,modest, blameless as the very flowers in the fields--a nature fine andbeautiful, a character supremely great. To know her from that documentwould be to know her as the exact reverse of all that. Nothing that shewas appears in it, everything that she was not appears there in detail.
Consider some of the things it charges against her, and remember who itis it is speaking of. It calls her a sorceress, a false prophet, aninvoker and companion of evil spirits, a dealer in magic, a personignorant of the Catholic faith, a schismatic; she is sacrilegious, anidolater, an apostate, a blasphemer of God and His saints, scandalous,seditious, a disturber of the peace; she incites men to war, and to thespilling of human blood; she discards the decencies and proprieties ofher sex, irreverently assuming the dress of a man and the vocation of asoldier; she beguiles both princes and people; she usurps divine honors,and has caused herself to be adored and venerated, offering her hands andher vestments to be kissed.
There it is--every fact of her life distorted, perverted, reversed. As achild she had loved the fairies, she had spoken a pitying word for themwhen they were banished from their home, she had played under their treeand around their fountain--hence she was a comrade of evil spirits.
She had lifted France out of the mud and moved her to strike for freedom,and led her to victory after victory--hence she was a disturber of thepeace--as indeed she was, and a provoker of war--as indeed she was again!and France will be proud of it and grateful for it for many a century tocome. And she had been adored--as if she could help that, poor thing, orwas in any way to blame for it. The cowed veteran and the waveringrecruit had drunk the spirit of war from her eyes and touched her swordwith theirs and moved forward invincible--hence she was a sorceress.
And so the document went on, detail by detail, turning these waters oflife to poison, this gold to dross, these proofs of a noble and beautifullife to evidences of a foul and odious one.
Of course, the sixty-six articles were just a rehash of the things whichhad come up in the course of the previous trials, so I will touch uponthis new trial but lightly. In fact, Joan went but little into detailherself, usually merely saying, "That is not true--passez outre"; or, "Ihave answered that before--let the clerk read it in his record," orsaying some other brief thing.
She refused to have her mission examined and tried by the earthly Church.The refusal was taken note of.
She denied the accusation of idolatry and that she had sought men'shomage. She said:
"If any kissed my hands and my vestments it was not by my desire, and Idid what I could to prevent it."
She had the pluck to say to that deadly tribunal that she did not knowthe fairies to be evil beings. She knew it was a perilous thing to say,but it was not in her nature to speak anything but the truth when shespoke at all. Danger had no weight with her in such things. Note wastaken of her remark.
She refused, as always before, when asked if she would put off the maleattire if she were given permission to commune. And she added this:
"When one receives the sacrament, the manner of his dress is a smallthing and of no value in the eyes of Our Lord."
She was charge with being so stubborn in clinging to her male dress thatshe would not lay it off even to get the blessed privilege of hearingmass. She spoke out with spirit and said:
"I would rather die than be untrue to my oath to God."
She was reproached with doing man's work in the wars and thus desertingthe industries proper to her sex. She answered, with some little touch ofsoldierly disdain:
"As to the matter of women's work, there's plenty to do it."
It was always a comfort to me to see the soldier spirit crop up in her.While that remained in her she would be Joan of Arc, and able to looktrouble and fate in the face.
"It appears that this mission of yours which you claim you had from God,was to make war and pour out human blood."
Joan replied quite simply, contenting herself with explaining that warwas not her first move, but her second:
"To begin with, I demanded that peace should be made. If it was refused,then I would fight."
The judge mixed the Burgundians and English together in speaking of theenemy which Joan had come to make war upon. But she showed that she madea distinction between them by act and word, the Burgundians beingFrenchmen and therefore entitled to less brusque treatment than theEnglish. She said:
"As to the Duke of Burgundy, I required of him, both by letters and byhis ambassadors, that he make peace with the King. As to the English, theonly peace for them was that they leave the country and go home."
Then she said that even with the English she had shown a pacificdisposition, since she had warned them away by proclamation beforeattacking them.
"If they had listened to me," said she, "they would have done wisely." Atthis point she uttered her prophecy again, saying with emphasis, "Beforeseven years they will see it themselves."
Then they presently began to pester her again about her male costume, andtried to persuade her to voluntarily promise to discard it. I was neverdeep, so I think it no wonder that I was puzzled by their persistency inwhat seemed a thing of no consequence, and could not make out what theirreason could be. But we all know now. We all know now that it was anotherof their treacherous projects. Yes, if they could but succeed in gettingher to formally discard it they could play a game upon her which wouldquickly destroy her. So they kept at their evil work until at last shebroke out and said:
"Peace! Without the permission of God I will not lay it off though youcut off my head!"
At one point she corrected the proces verbal, saying:
"It makes me say that everything which I have done was done by thecounsel of Our Lord. I did not say that, I said 'all which I have welldone.'"
Doubt was cast upon the authenticity of her mission because of theignorance and simplicity of the messenger chosen. Joan smiled at that.She could have reminded these people that Our Lord, who is no respecterof persons, had chosen the lowly for his high purposes even oftener thanhe had chosen bishops and cardinals; but she phrased her rebuke insimpler terms:
"It is the prerogative of Our Lord to choose His instruments where Hewill."
She was asked what form of prayer she used in invoking counsel from onhigh. She said the form was brief and simple; then she lifted her pallidface and repeated it, clasping her chained hands:
"Most dear God, in honor of your holy passion I beseech you, if you loveme, that you will reveal to me what I am to answer to these churchmen. Asconcerns my dress, I know by what command I have put it on, but I knownot in what manner I am to lay it off. I pray you tell me what to do."
She was charged with having dared, against the precepts of God and Hissaints, to assume empire over men and make herself Commander-in-Chief.That touched the soldier in her. She had a deep reverence for priests,but the soldier in her had but small reverence for a priest's opinionsabout war; so, in her answer to this charge she did not condescend to gointo any explanations or excuses, but delivered herself with blandindifference and military brevity.
"If I was Commander-in-Chief, it was to thrash the English."
Death was staring her in the face here all the time, but no matter; shedearly loved to make these English-hearted Frenchmen squirm, and wheneverthey gave her an opening she was prompt to jab her sting into it. She gotgreat refreshment out of these little episodes. Her days were a desert;these were the oases in it.
Her being in the wars with men was charged against her as an indelicacy.She said:
"I had a woman with me when I could--in towns and lodgings. In the fieldI always slept in my armor."
That she and her family had been ennobled by the King was charged againsther as evidence that the source of her deeds were sordid self-seeking.She answered that she had not asked this grace of the King; it was hisown act.
This third trial was ended at last. And once again there was no definiteresult.
Possibly a fourth trial might succeed in defeating this apparentlyunconquerable girl. So the malignant Bishop set himself to work to planit.
He appointed a commission to reduce the substance of the sixty-sixarticles to twelve compact lies, as a basis for the new attempt. This wasdone. It took several days.
Meantime Cauchon went to Joan's cell one day, with Manchon and two of thejudges, Isambard de la Pierre and Martin Ladvenue, to see if he could notmanage somehow to beguile Joan into submitting her mission to theexamination and decision of the Church Militant--that is to say, to thatpart of the Church Militant which was represented by himself and hiscreatures.
Joan once more positively refused. Isambard de la Pierre had a heart inhis body, and he so pitied this persecuted poor girl that he ventured todo a very daring thing; for he asked her if she would be willing to haveher case go before the Council of Basel, and said it contained as manypriests of her party as of the English party.
Joan cried out that she would gladly go before so fairly constructed atribunal as that; but before Isambard could say another word Cauchonturned savagely upon him and exclaimed:
"Shut up, in the devil's name!"
Then Manchon ventured to do a brave thing, too, though he did it in greatfear for his life. He asked Cauchon if he should enter Joan's submissionto the Council of Basel upon the minutes.
"No! It is not necessary."
"Ah," said poor Joan, reproachfully, "you set down everything that isagainst me, but you will not set down what is for me."
It was piteous. It would have touched the heart of a brute. But Cauchonwas more than that.
