A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we wouldtake some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot break-fast. And afterwards we would watch the lonesome-ness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by andby lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look tosee what done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughingalong up-stream, so far off towards the other side youcouldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was astern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour therewouldn't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see -- justsolid lonesomeness. Next you'd see a raft sliding by,away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping,because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'dsee the axe flash and come down -- you don'thear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and bythe time it's above the man's head then you hear theK'CHUNK! -- it had took all that time to come over thewater. So we would put in the day, lazying around,listening to the stillness. Once there was a thick fog,and the rafts and things that went by was beating tinpans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them. Ascow or a raft went by so close we could hear themtalking and cussing and laughing -- heard them plain;but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made you feelcrawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in theair. Jim said he believed it was spirits; but I says:
"No; spirits wouldn't say, 'Dern the dern fog.'"
Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we gother out to about the middle we let her alone, and lether float wherever the current wanted her to; then welit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, andtalked about all kinds of things -- we was alwaysnaked, day and night, whenever the mosquitoes wouldlet us -- the new clothes Buck's folks made for me wastoo good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't gomuch on clothes, nohow.
Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselvesfor the longest time. Yonder was the banks and theislands, across the water; and maybe a spark -- whichwas a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on thewater you could see a spark or two -- on a raft or ascow, you know; and maybe you could hear a fiddleor a song coming over from one of them crafts. It'slovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, allspeckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backsand look up at them, and discuss about whether theywas made or only just happened. Jim he allowedthey was made, but I allowed they happened; I judgedit would have took too long to MAKE so many. Jimsaid the moon could a LAID them; well, that lookedkind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing against it,because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so ofcourse it could be done. We used to watch the starsthat fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowedthey'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.
Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboatslipping along in the dark, and now and then shewould belch a whole world of sparks up out of herchimbleys, and they would rain down in the river andlook awful pretty; then she would turn a corner andher lights would wink out and her powwow shut offand leave the river still again; and by and by herwaves would get to us, a long time after she was gone,and joggle the raft a bit, and after that you wouldn'thear nothing for you couldn't tell how long, exceptmaybe frogs or something.
After midnight the people on shore went to bed,and then for two or three hours the shores was black --no more sparks in the cabin windows. These sparkswas our clock -- the first one that showed again meantmorning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide andtie up right away.
One morning about daybreak I found a canoe andcrossed over a chute to the main shore -- it was onlytwo hundred yards -- and paddled about a mile up acrick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn'tget some berries. Just as I was passing a place wherea kind of a cowpath crossed the crick, here comes acouple of men tearing up the path as tight as theycould foot it. I thought I was a goner, for wheneveranybody was after anybody I judged it was ME -- ormaybe Jim. I was about to dig out from there in ahurry, but they was pretty close to me then, and sungout and begged me to save their lives -- said theyhadn't been doing nothing, and was being chased forit -- said there was men and dogs a-coming. Theywanted to jump right in, but I says:
"Don't you do it. I don't hear the dogs and horsesyet; you've got time to crowd through the brush andget up the crick a little ways; then you take to thewater and wade down to me and get in -- that'll throwthe dogs off the scent."
They done it, and soon as they was aboard I litout for our towhead, and in about five or ten minuteswe heard the dogs and the men away off, shouting.We heard them come along towards the crick, butcouldn't see them; they seemed to stop and foolaround a while; then, as we got further and furtheraway all the time, we couldn't hardly hear them at all;by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us andstruck the river, everything was quiet, and we paddledover to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods andwas safe.
One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards,and had a bald head and very gray whiskers. He hadan old battered-up slouch hat on, and a greasy bluewoollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffedinto his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses -- no, heonly had one. He had an old long-tailed blue jeanscoat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm, andboth of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.
The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed aboutas ornery. After breakfast we all laid off and talked,and the first thing that come out was that these chapsdidn't know one another.
"What got you into trouble?" says the baldhead tot'other chap.
"Well, I'd been selling an article to take the tartaroff the teeth -- and it does take it off, too, and generlythe enamel along with it -- but I stayed about onenight longer than I ought to, and was just in the act ofsliding out when I ran across you on the trail this sideof town, and you told me they were coming, and beggedme to help you to get off. So I told you I was ex-pecting trouble myself, and would scatter out WITH you.That's the whole yarn -- what's yourn?
"Well, I'd ben a-running' a little temperance revivalthar 'bout a week, and was the pet of the womenfolks, big and little, for I was makin' it mighty warmfor the rummies, I TELL you, and takin' as much as fiveor six dollars a night -- ten cents a head, children andniggers free -- and business a-growin' all the time,when somehow or another a little report got aroundlast night that I had a way of puttin' in my time witha private jug on the sly. A nigger rousted me outthis mornin', and told me the people was getherin' onthe quiet with their dogs and horses, and they'd bealong pretty soon and give me 'bout half an hour'sstart, and then run me down if they could; and if theygot me they'd tar and feather me and ride me on arail, sure. I didn't wait for no breakfast -- I warn'thungry."
"Old man," said the young one, "I reckon wemight double-team it together; what do you think?"
"I ain't undisposed. What's your line -- mainly?"
"Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medi-cines; theater-actor -- tragedy, you know; take a turnto mesmerism and phrenology when there's a chance;teach singing-geography school for a change; sling alecture sometimes -- oh, I do lots of things -- mostanything that comes handy, so it ain't work. What'syour lay?"
"I've done considerble in the doctoring way in mytime. Layin' on o' hands is my best holt -- for cancerand paralysis, and sich things; and I k'n tell a fortunepretty good when I've got somebody along to find outthe facts for me. Preachin's my line, too, andworkin' camp-meetin's, and missionaryin' around."
Nobody never said anything for a while; then theyoung man hove a sigh and says:
"Alas!"
"What 're you alassin' about?" says the bald-head.
"To think I should have lived to be leading such alife, and be degraded down into such company." Andhe begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag.
"Dern your skin, ain't the company good enoughfor you?" says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.
" Yes, it IS good enough for me; it's as good as Ideserve; for who fetched me so low when I was sohigh? I did myself. I don't blame YOU, gentlemen --far from it; I don't blame anybody. I deserve it all.Let the cold world do its worst; one thing I know --there's a grave somewhere for me. The world maygo on just as it's always done, and take everythingfrom me -- loved ones, property, everything; but itcan't take that. Some day I'll lie down in it and for-get it all, and my poor broken heart will be at rest."He went on a-wiping.
"Drot your pore broken heart," says the baldhead;"what are you heaving your pore broken heart at USf'r? WE hain't done nothing."
"No, I know you haven't. I ain't blaming you,gentlemen. I brought myself down -- yes, I did itmyself. It's right I should suffer -- perfectly right --I don't make any moan."
"Brought you down from whar? Whar was youbrought down from?"
"Ah, you would not believe me; the world neverbelieves -- let it pass -- 'tis no matter. The secret ofmy birth --"
"The secret of your birth! Do you mean to say --"
"Gentlemen," says the young man, very solemn,"I will reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confi-dence in you. By rights I am a duke!"
Jim's eyes bugged out when he heard that; and Ireckon mine did, too. Then the baldhead says:"No! you can't mean it?"
"Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of theDuke of Bridgewater, fled to this country about theend of the last century, to breathe the pure air of free-dom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his ownfather dying about the same time. The second son ofthe late duke seized the titles and estates -- the infantreal duke was ignored. I am the lineal descendant ofthat infant -- I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater;and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate,hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged,worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the companion-ship of felons on a raft!"
Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. Wetried to comfort him, but he said it warn't much use,he couldn't be much comforted; said if we was a mindto acknowledge him, that would do him more goodthan most anything else; so we said we would, if hewould tell us how. He said we ought to bow whenwe spoke to him, and say "Your Grace," or "MyLord," or "Your Lordship" -- and he wouldn't mindit if we called him plain "Bridgewater," which, hesaid, was a title anyway, and not a name; and one ofus ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any littlething for him he wanted done.
Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All throughdinner Jim stood around and waited on him, and says,"Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or some o' dat?"and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasingto him.
But the old man got pretty silent by and by -- didn'thave much to say, and didn't look pretty comfortableover all that petting that was going on around thatduke. He seemed to have something on his mind.So, along in the afternoon, he says:
"Looky here, Bilgewater," he says, "I'm nationsorry for you, but you ain't the only person that's hadtroubles like that."
"No?"
"No you ain't. You ain't the only person that'sben snaked down wrongfully out'n a high place."
"Alas!"
"No, you ain't the only person that's had a secretof his birth." And, by jings, HE begins to cry.
"Hold! What do you mean?"
"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?" says the old man,still sort of sobbing.
"To the bitter death!" He took the old man bythe hand and squeezed it, and says, "That secret ofyour being: speak!"
"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!"
You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Thenthe duke says:
"You are what?"
"Yes, my friend, it is too true -- your eyes is look-in' at this very moment on the pore disappearedDauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Six-teen and Marry Antonette."
"You! At your age! No! You mean you'rethe late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hun-dred years old, at the very least."
"Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has doneit; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this prema-ture balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you,in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled, tram-pled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France."
Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jimdidn't know hardly what to do, we was so sorry -- andso glad and proud we'd got him with us, too. So weset in, like we done before with the duke, and tried tocomfort HIM. But he said it warn't no use, nothingbut to be dead and done with it all could do him anygood; though he said it often made him feel easier andbetter for a while if people treated him according tohis rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him,and always called him "Your Majesty," and waitedon him first at meals, and didn't set down in hispresence till he asked them. So Jim and me set tomajestying him, and doing this and that and t'otherfor him, and standing up till he told us we might setdown. This done him heaps of good, and so he gotcheerful and comfortable. But the duke kind of souredon him, and didn't look a bit satisfied with the waythings was going; still, the king acted real friendlytowards him, and said the duke's great-grandfatherand all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good dealthought of by HIS father, and was allowed to come tothe palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy agood while, till by and by the king says:
"Like as not we got to be together a blamed longtime on this h-yer raft, Bilgewater, and so what's theuse o' your bein' sour? It 'll only make things on-comfortable. It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,it ain't your fault you warn't born a king -- so what'sthe use to worry? Make the best o' things the wayyou find 'em, says I -- that's my motto. This ain'tno bad thing that we've struck here -- plenty gruband an easy life -- come, give us your hand, duke, andle's all be friends."
The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty gladto see it. It took away all the uncomfortableness andwe felt mighty good over it, because it would a been amiserable business to have any unfriendliness on theraft; for what you want, above all things, on a raft, isfor everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kindtowards the others.
It didn't take me long to make up my mind thatthese liars warn't no kings nor dukes at all, but justlow-down humbugs and frauds. But I never saidnothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the bestway; then you don't have no quarrels, and don't getinto no trouble. If they wanted us to call them kingsand dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as it wouldkeep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tellJim, so I didn't tell him. If I never learnt nothingelse out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get alongwith his kind of people is to let them have their ownway.
