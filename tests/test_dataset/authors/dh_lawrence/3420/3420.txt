  Since you did depart	Out of my reach, my darling,	Into the hidden,	I see each shadow start	With recognition, and I Am wonder-ridden.	 I am dazed with the farewell,	But I scarcely feel your loss.	You left me a gift	Of tongues, so the shadows tell Me things, and silences toss	Me their drift.	 You sent me a cloven fire	Out of death, and it burns in the draught	Of the breathing hosts, Kindles the darkening pyre	For the sorrowful, till strange brands waft	Like candid ghosts.	 Form after form, in the streets	Waves like a ghost along, Kindled to me;	The star above the house-top greets	Me every eve with a long	Song fierily.	 All day long, the town Glimmers with subtle ghosts	Going up and down	In a common, prison-like dress;	But their daunted looking flickers	To me, and I answer, Yes!  So I am not lonely nor sad	Although bereaved of you,	My little love.	I move among a kinsfolk clad	With words, but the dream shows through As they move.
