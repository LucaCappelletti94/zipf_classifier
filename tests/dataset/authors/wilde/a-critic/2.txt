(Century Guild Hobby Horse, July 1886)


During my tour in America I happened one evening to find myself in
Louisville, Kentucky. The subject I had selected to speak on was the
Mission of Art in the Nineteenth Century, and in the course of my lecture
I had occasion to quote Keats's Sonnet on Blue as an example of the
poet's delicate sense of colour-harmonies. When my lecture was concluded
there came round to see me a lady of middle age, with a sweet gentle
manner and a most musical voice. She introduced herself to me as Mrs.
Speed, the daughter of George Keats, and invited me to come and examine
the Keats manuscripts in her possession. I spent most of the next day
with her, reading the letters of Keats to her father, some of which were
at that time unpublished, poring over torn yellow leaves and faded scraps
of paper, and wondering at the little Dante in which Keats had written
those marvellous notes on Milton. Some months afterwards, when I was in
California, I received a letter from Mrs. Speed asking my acceptance of
the original manuscript of the sonnet which I had quoted in my lecture.
This manuscript I have had reproduced here, as it seems to me to possess
much psychological interest. It shows us the conditions that preceded
the perfected form, the gradual growth, not of the conception but of the
expression, and the workings of that spirit of selection which is the
secret of style. In the case of poetry, as in the case of the other
arts, what may appear to be simply technicalities of method are in their
essence spiritual not mechanical, and although, in all lovely work, what
concerns us is the ultimate form, not the conditions that necessitate
that form, yet the preference that precedes perfection, the evolution of
the beauty, and the mere making of the music, have, if not their artistic
value, at least their value to the artist.
It will be remembered that this sonnet was first published in 1848 by
Lord Houghton in his Life, Letters, and Literary Remains of John
Keats. Lord Houghton does not definitely state where he found it, but
it was probably among the Keats manuscripts belonging to Mr. Charles
Brown. It is evidently taken from a version later than that in my
possession, as it accepts all the corrections, and makes three
variations. As in my manuscript the first line is torn away, I give the
sonnet here as it appears in Lord Houghton's edition.



          Dark eyes are dearer far
    Than those that make the hyacinthine bell. {5}
                                                        By J. H. REYNOLDS.

    Blue!  'Tis the life of heaven,--the domain
       Of Cynthia,--the wide palace of the sun,--
    The tent of Hesperus and all his train,--
       The bosomer of clouds, gold, grey and dun.
    Blue!  'Tis the life of waters--ocean
       And all its vassal streams: pools numberless
    May rage, and foam, and fret, but never can
       Subside if not to dark-blue nativeness.
    Blue! gentle cousin of the forest green,
       Married to green in all the sweetest flowers,
    Forget-me-not,--the blue-bell,--and, that queen
       Of secrecy, the violet: what strange powers
    Hast thou, as a mere shadow!  But how great,
       When in an Eye thou art alive with fate!
                                                              Feb. 1818


In the Athenaeum of the 3rd of June 1876 appeared a letter from Mr. A.
J. Horwood, stating that he had in his possession a copy of The Garden
of Florence in which this sonnet was transcribed. Mr. Horwood, who was
unaware that the sonnet had been already published by Lord Houghton,
gives the transcript at length. His version reads hue for life in
the first line, and bright for wide in the second, and gives the
sixth line thus:
 With all his tributary streams, pools numberless,
a foot too long: it also reads to for of in the ninth line. Mr.
Buxton Forman is of opinion that these variations are decidedly genuine,
but indicative of an earlier state of the poem than that adopted in Lord
Houghton's edition. However, now that we have before us Keats's first
draft of his sonnet, it is difficult to believe that the sixth line in
Mr. Horwood's version is really a genuine variation. Keats may have
written,
                Ocean
    His tributary streams, pools numberless,

and the transcript may have been carelessly made, but having got his line
right in his first draft, Keats probably did not spoil it in his second.
The Athenaeum version inserts a comma after art in the last line,
which seems to me a decided improvement, and eminently characteristic of
Keats's method. I am glad to see that Mr. Buxton Forman has adopted it.
As for the corrections that Lord Houghton's version shows Keats to have
made in the eighth and ninth lines of this sonnet, it is evident that
they sprang from Keats's reluctance to repeat the same word in
consecutive lines, except in cases where a word's music or meaning was to
be emphasized. The substitution of 'its' for 'his' in the sixth line is
more difficult of explanation. It was due probably to a desire on
Keats's part not to mar by any echo the fine personification of Hesperus.
It may be noticed that Keats's own eyes were brown, and not blue, as
stated by Mrs. Proctor to Lord Houghton. Mrs. Speed showed me a note to
that effect written by Mrs. George Keats on the margin of the page in
Lord Houghton's Life (p. 100, vol. i.), where Mrs. Proctor's
description is given. Cowden Clarke made a similar correction in his
Recollections, and in some of the later editions of Lord Houghton's
book the word 'blue' is struck out. In Severn's portraits of Keats also
the eyes are given as brown.
The exquisite sense of colour expressed in the ninth and tenth lines may
be paralleled by
    The Ocean with its vastness, its blue green,
of the sonnet to George Keats.


{5} 'Make' is of course a mere printer's error for 'mock,' and was
subsequently corrected by Lord Houghton. The sonnet as given in The
Garden of Florence reads 'orbs for 'those.'
