  The darkness steals the forms of all the queens,	But oh, the palms of his two black hands are red,	Inflamed with binding up the sheaves of dead	Hours that were once all glory and all queens.	 And I remember all the sunny hours Of queens in hyacinth and skies of gold,	And morning singing where the woods are scrolled	And diapered above the chaunting flowers.	 Here lamps are white like snowdrops in the grass;	The town is like a churchyard, all so still And grey now night is here; nor will	Another torn red sunset come to pass.
