His attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked hispleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without.
"Admit him, admit him!" exclaimed the King eagerly.
The Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King's couch,saying--
"I have given order, and, according to the King's command, thepeers of the realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of theHouse, where, having confirmed the Duke of Norfolk's doom, theyhumbly wait his majesty's further pleasure in the matter."
The King's face lit up with a fierce joy.  Said he--
"Lift me up!  In mine own person will I go before my Parliament,and with mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of--"
His voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks;and the attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedlyassisted him with restoratives.  Presently he said sorrowfully--
"Alack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late itcometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance.  But speed ye,speed ye! let others do this happy office sith 'tis denied to me.I put my Great Seal in commission:  choose thou the lords thatshall compose it, and get ye to your work.  Speed ye, man!  Beforethe sun shall rise and set again, bring me his head that I may seeit."
"According to the King's command, so shall it be.  Will't pleaseyour majesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so thatI may forth upon the business?"
"The Seal?  Who keepeth the Seal but thou?"
"Please your majesty, you did take it from me two days since,saying it should no more do its office till your own royal handshould use it upon the Duke of Norfolk's warrant."
"Why, so in sooth I did:  I do remember . . . What did I with it?. . . I am very feeble . . . So oft these days doth my memory playthe traitor with me . . . 'Tis strange, strange--"
The King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his greyhead weakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollectwhat he had done with the Seal.  At last my Lord Hertford venturedto kneel and offer information--
"Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do rememberwith me how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of hishighness the Prince of Wales to keep against the day that--"
"True, most true!" interrupted the King.  "Fetch it!  Go:  timeflieth!"
Lord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before verylong, troubled and empty-handed.  He delivered himself to thiseffect--
"It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcometidings; but it is the will of God that the prince's afflictionabideth still, and he cannot recall to mind that he received theSeal.  So came I quickly to report, thinking it were waste ofprecious time, and little worth withal, that any should attempt tosearch the long array of chambers and saloons that belong unto hisroyal high--"
A groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point.  After alittle while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone--
"Trouble him no more, poor child.  The hand of God lieth heavyupon him, and my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, andsorrow that I may not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weightedshoulders, and so bring him peace."
He closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent.After a time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly arounduntil his glance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor.Instantly his face flushed with wrath--
"What, thou here yet!  By the glory of God, an' thou gettest notabout that traitor's business, thy mitre shall have holiday themorrow for lack of a head to grace withal!"
The trembling Chancellor answered--
"Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy!  I but waited for the Seal."
"Man, hast lost thy wits?  The small Seal which aforetime I waswont to take with me abroad lieth in my treasury.  And, since theGreat Seal hath flown away, shall not it suffice?  Hast lost thywits?  Begone!  And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring hishead."
The poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from thisdangerous vicinity; nor did the commission waste time in givingthe royal assent to the work of the slavish Parliament, andappointing the morrow for the beheading of the premier peer ofEngland, the luckless Duke of Norfolk. {1}
