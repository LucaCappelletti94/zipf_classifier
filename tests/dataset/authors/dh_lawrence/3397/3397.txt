From Amores, (1916).

  Always, sweetheart,	Carry into your room the blossoming boughs of cherry,	Almond and apple and pear diffuse with light, that very	Soon strews itself on the floor; and keep the radiance of spring	Fresh quivering; keep the sunny-swift March-days waiting In a little throng at your door, and admit the one who is plaiting	Her hair for womanhood, and play awhile with her, then bid her depart.	  A come and go of March-day loves	 Through the flower-vine, trailing screen;	 A fluttering in of doves.  Then a launch abroad of shrinking doves	 Over the waste where no hope is seen	 Of open hands:	 Dance in and out 
Small-bosomed girls of the spring of love, With a bubble of laughter, and shrilly shout	Of mirth; then the dripping of tears on your glove.
