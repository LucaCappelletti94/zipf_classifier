Noise proves nothing. Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles asif she had laid an asteroid. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
WEDNESDAY, Sept. 11. In this world we often make mistakes of judgment.We do not as a rule get out of them sound and whole, but sometimes we do.At dinner yesterday evening-present, a mixture of Scotch, English,American, Canadian, and Australasian folk--a discussion broke out aboutthe pronunciation of certain Scottish words. This was private ground,and the non-Scotch nationalities, with one exception, discreetly keptstill. But I am not discreet, and I took a hand. I didn't know anythingabout the subject, but I took a hand just to have something to do. Atthat moment the word in dispute was the word three. One Scotchman wasclaiming that the peasantry of Scotland pronounced it three, hisadversaries claimed that they didn't--that they pronounced it 'thraw'.The solitary Scot was having a sultry time of it, so I thought I wouldenrich him with my help. In my position I was necessarily quiteimpartial, and was equally as well and as ill equipped to fight on theone side as on the other. So I spoke up and said the peasantrypronounced the word three, not thraw. It was an error of judgment.There was a moment of astonished and ominous silence, then weatherensued. The storm rose and spread in a surprising way, and I was snowedunder in a very few minutes. It was a bad defeat for me--a kind ofWaterloo. It promised to remain so, and I wished I had had better sensethan to enter upon such a forlorn enterprise. But just then I had asaving thought--at least a thought that offered a chance. While thestorm was still raging, I made up a Scotch couplet, and then spoke up andsaid:
"Very well, don't say any more. I confess defeat. I thought I knew, butI see my mistake. I was deceived by one of your Scotch poets."
"A Scotch poet! O come! Name him."
"Robert Burns."
It is wonderful the power of that name. These men looked doubtful--butparalyzed, all the same. They were quite silent for a moment; then oneof them said--with the reverence in his voice which is always present ina Scotchman's tone when he utters the name.
"Does Robbie Burns say--what does he say?"
"This is what he says:
 'There were nae bairns but only three --Ane at the breast, twa at the knee.'"
It ended the discussion. There was no man there profane enough, disloyalenough, to say any word against a thing which Robert Burns had settled.I shall always honor that great name for the salvation it brought me inthis time of my sore need.
It is my belief that nearly any invented quotation, played withconfidence, stands a good chance to deceive. There are people who thinkthat honesty is always the best policy. This is a superstition; thereare times when the appearance of it is worth six of it.
We are moving steadily southward-getting further and further down underthe projecting paunch of the globe. Yesterday evening we saw the BigDipper and the north star sink below the horizon and disappear from ourworld. No, not "we," but they. They saw it--somebody saw it--and toldme about it. But it is no matter, I was not caring for those things, Iam tired of them, any way. I think they are well enough, but one doesn'twant them always hanging around. My interest was all in the SouthernCross. I had never seen that. I had heard about it all my life, and itwas but natural that I should be burning to see it. No otherconstellation makes so much talk. I had nothing against the Big Dipper--and naturally couldn't have anything against it, since it is a citizen ofour own sky, and the property of the United States--but I did want it tomove out of the way and give this foreigner a chance. Judging by thesize of the talk which the Southern Cross had made, I supposed it wouldneed a sky all to itself.
But that was a mistake. We saw the Cross to-night, and it is not large.Not large, and not strikingly bright. But it was low down toward thehorizon, and it may improve when it gets up higher in the sky. It isingeniously named, for it looks just as a cross would look if it lookedlike something else. But that description does not describe; it is toovague, too general, too indefinite. It does after a fashion suggest across across that is out of repair--or out of drawing; not correctlyshaped. It is long, with a short cross-bar, and the cross-bar is cantedout of the straight line.
It consists of four large stars and one little one. The little one isout of line and further damages the shape. It should have been placed atthe intersection of the stem and the cross-bar. If you do not draw animaginary line from star to star it does not suggest a cross--noranything in particular.
One must ignore the little star, and leave it out of the combination--itconfuses everything. If you leave it out, then you can make out of thefour stars a sort of cross--out of true; or a sort of kite--out of true;or a sort of coffin-out of true.
Constellations have always been troublesome things to name. If you giveone of them a fanciful name, it will always refuse to live up to it; itwill always persist in not resembling the thing it has been named for.Ultimately, to satisfy the public, the fanciful name has to be discardedfor a common-sense one, a manifestly descriptive one. The Great Bearremained the Great Bear--and unrecognizable as such--for thousands ofyears; and people complained about it all the time, and quite properly;but as soon as it became the property of the United States, Congresschanged it to the Big Dipper, and now every body is satisfied, and thereis no more talk about riots. I would not change the Southern Cross tothe Southern Coffin, I would change it to the Southern Kite; for up therein the general emptiness is the proper home of a kite, but not forcoffins and crosses and dippers. In a little while, now--I cannottell exactly how long it will be--the globe will belong to theEnglish-speaking race; and of course the skies also. Then theconstellations will be re-organized, and polished up, and re-named--themost of them "Victoria," I reckon, but this one will sail thereafter asthe Southern Kite, or go out of business. Several towns and things, hereand there, have been named for Her Majesty already.
In these past few days we are plowing through a mighty Milky Way ofislands. They are so thick on the map that one would hardly expect tofind room between them for a canoe; yet we seldom glimpse one. Once wesaw the dim bulk of a couple of them, far away, spectral and dreamythings; members of the Horne-Alofa and Fortuna. On the larger one aretwo rival native kings--and they have a time together. They areCatholics; so are their people. The missionaries there are Frenchpriests.
From the multitudinous islands in these regions the "recruits" for theQueensland plantations were formerly drawn; are still drawn from them, Ibelieve. Vessels fitted up like old-time slavers came here and carriedoff the natives to serve as laborers in the great Australian province.In the beginning it was plain, simple man-stealing, as per testimony ofthe missionaries. This has been denied, but not disproven. Afterward itwas forbidden by law to "recruit" a native without his consent, andgovernmental agents were sent in all recruiting vessels to see that thelaw was obeyed--which they did, according to the recruiting people; andwhich they sometimes didn't, according to the missionaries. A man couldbe lawfully recruited for a three-years term of service; he couldvolunteer for another term if he so chose; when his time was up he couldreturn to his island. And would also have the means to do it; for thegovernment required the employer to put money in its hands for thispurpose before the recruit was delivered to him.
Captain Wawn was a recruiting ship-master during many years. From hispleasant book one gets the idea that the recruiting business was quitepopular with the islanders, as a rule. And yet that did not make thebusiness wholly dull and uninteresting; for one finds rather frequentlittle breaks in the monotony of it--like this, for instance:
 "The afternoon of our arrival at Leper Island the schooner was lying almost becalmed under the lee of the lofty central portion of the island, about three-quarters of a mile from the shore. The boats were in sight at some distance. The recruiter-boat had run into a small nook on the rocky coast, under a high bank, above which stood a solitary hut backed by dense forest. The government agent and mate in the second boat lay about 400 yards to the westward.
 "Suddenly we heard the sound of firing, followed by yells from the natives on shore, and then we saw the recruiter-boat push out with a seemingly diminished crew. The mate's boat pulled quickly up, took her in tow, and presently brought her alongside, all her own crew being more or less hurt. It seems the natives had called them into the place on pretence of friendship. A crowd gathered about the stern of the boat, and several fellows even got into her. All of a sudden our men were attacked with clubs and tomahawks. The recruiter escaped the first blows aimed at him, making play with his fists until he had an opportunity to draw his revolver. 'Tom Sayers,' a Mare man, received a tomahawk blow on the head which laid the scalp open but did not penetrate his skull, fortunately. 'Bobby Towns,' another Mare boatman, had both his thumbs cut in warding off blows, one of them being so nearly severed from the hand that the doctors had to finish the operation. Lihu, a Lifu boy, the recruiter's special attendant, was cut and pricked in various places, but nowhere seriously. Jack, an unlucky Tanna recruit, who had been engaged to act as boatman, received an arrow through his forearm, the head of which--apiece of bone seven or eight inches long--was still in the limb, protruding from both sides, when the boats returned. The recruiter himself would have got off scot-free had not an arrow pinned one of his fingers to the loom of the steering-oar just as they were getting off. The fight had been short but sharp. The enemy lost two men, both shot dead."
The truth is, Captain Wawn furnishes such a crowd of instances of fatalencounters between natives and French and English recruiting-crews (forthe French are in the business for the plantations of New Caledonia),that one is almost persuaded that recruiting is not thoroughly popularamong the islanders; else why this bristling string of attacks andbloodcurdling slaughter? The captain lays it all to "Exeter Hallinfluence." But for the meddling philanthropists, the native fathers andmothers would be fond of seeing their children carted into exile and nowand then the grave, instead of weeping about it and trying to kill thekind recruiters.
