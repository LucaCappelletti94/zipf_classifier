"Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!"
He flung a bag of something into the boat, and thengot in himself and set down. It was Packard. ThenBill HE come out and got in. Packard says, in a lowvoice:
"All ready -- shove off!"
I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was soweak. But Bill says:
"Hold on -- 'd you go through him?"
"No. Didn't you?"
"No. So he's got his share o' the cash yet."
"Well, then, come along; no use to take truck andleave money."
"Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?"
"Maybe he won't. But we got to have it anyway.Come along."
So they got out and went in.
The door slammed to because it was on the careenedside; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jimcome tumbling after me. I out with my knife and cutthe rope, and away we went!
We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak norwhisper, nor hardly even breathe. We went glidingswift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two morewe was a hundred yards below the wreck, and thedarkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and wewas safe, and knowed it.
When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at thetexas door for a second, and we knowed by that thatthe rascals had missed their boat, and was beginningto understand that they was in just as much trouble nowas Jim Turner was.
Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out afterour raft. Now was the first time that I begun to worryabout the men -- I reckon I hadn't had time to before.I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for mur-derers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, thereain't no telling but I might come to be a murderermyself yet, and then how would I like it? So says Ito Jim:
"The first light we see we'll land a hundred yardsbelow it or above it, in a place where it's a goodhiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I'll go andfix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to gofor that gang and get them out of their scrape, so theycan be hung when their time comes."
But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begunto storm again, and this time worse than ever. Therain poured down, and never a light showed; every-body in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down theriver, watching for lights and watching for our raft.After a long time the rain let up, but the cloudsstayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by andby a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, andwe made for it.
It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to getaboard of it again. We seen a light now away downto the right, on shore. So I said I would go for it.The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang hadstole there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raftin a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and showa light when he judged he had gone about two mile,and keep it burning till I come; then I manned myoars and shoved for the light. As I got down towardsit three or four more showed -- up on a hillside. Itwas a village. I closed in above the shore light, andlaid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see itwas a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hullferryboat. I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and by Ifound him roosting on the bitts forward, with his headdown between his knees. I gave his shoulder two orthree little shoves, and begun to cry.
He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but whenhe see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch,and then he says:
"Hello, what's up? Don't cry, bub. What's thetrouble?"
I says:
"Pap, and mam, and sis, and --"
Then I broke down. He says:
"Oh, dang it now, DON'T take on so; we all has tohave our troubles, and this 'n 'll come out all right.What's the matter with 'em?"
"They're -- they're -- are you the watchman of theboat?"
"Yes," he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like."I'm the captain and the owner and the mate and thepilot and watchman and head deck-hand; and some-times I'm the freight and passengers. I ain't as richas old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' gener-ous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is,and slam around money the way he does; but I'vetold him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places withhim; for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, andI'm derned if I'D live two mile out o' town, wherethere ain't nothing ever goin' on, not for all his spon-dulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I --"
I broke in and says:
"They're in an awful peck of trouble, and --"
"WHO is?"
"Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker;and if you'd take your ferryboat and go up there --"
"Up where? Where are they?"
"On the wreck."
"What wreck?"
"Why, there ain't but one."
"What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?"
"Yes."
"Good land! what are they doin' THERE, for gracioussakes?"
"Well, they didn't go there a-purpose."
"I bet they didn't! Why, great goodness, thereain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mightyquick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git intosuch a scrape?"
"Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting upthere to the town --"
"Yes, Booth's Landing -- go on."
"She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, andjust in the edge of the evening she started over withher nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all nightat her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-herQIdisremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a-floating down,stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on thewreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman andthe horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made agrab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hourafter dark we come along down in our trading-scow,and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till wewas right on it; and so WE saddle-baggsed; but all ofus was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh, he WAS thebest cretur ! -- I most wish 't it had been me, I do."
"My George! It's the beatenest thing I everstruck. And THEN what did you all do?"
"Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so widethere we couldn't make nobody hear. So pap saidsomebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. Iwas the only one that could swim, so I made a dashfor it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike helpsooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he'dfix the thing. I made the land about a mile below,and been fooling along ever since, trying to get peopleto do something, but they said, 'What, in such a nightand such a current? There ain't no sense in it; gofor the steam ferry.' Now if you'll go and --"
"By Jackson, I'd LIKE to, and, blame it, I don'tknow but I will; but who in the dingnation's a-going'to PAY for it? Do you reckon your pap --"
"Why THAT'S all right. Miss Hooker she tole me,PARTICULAR, that her uncle Hornback --"
"Great guns! is HE her uncle? Looky here, youbreak for that light over yonder-way, and turn outwest when you git there, and about a quarter of a mileout you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart youout to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill. Anddon't you fool around any, because he'll want to knowthe news. Tell him I'll have his niece all safe beforehe can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out myengineer."
I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned thecorner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed herout, and then pulled up shore in the easy water aboutsix hundred yards, and tucked myself in among somewoodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could seethe ferryboat start. But take it all around, I was feel-ing ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all thistrouble for that gang, for not many would a done it.I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged shewould be proud of me for helping these rapscallions,because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind thewidow and good people takes the most interest in.
Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim anddusky, sliding along down! A kind of cold shiverwent through me, and then I struck out for her. Shewas very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't muchchance for anybody being alive in her. I pulled allaround her and hollered a little, but there wasn't anyanswer; all dead still. I felt a little bit heavy-heartedabout the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if theycould stand it I could.
Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for themiddle of the river on a long down-stream slant; andwhen I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on myoars, and looked back and see her go and smell aroundthe wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because thecaptain would know her uncle Hornback would wantthem; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it upand went for the shore, and I laid into my work andwent a-booming down the river.
It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's lightshowed up; and when it did show it looked like it wasa thousand mile off. By the time I got there the skywas beginning to get a little gray in the east; so westruck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk theskiff, and turned in and slept like dead people.
