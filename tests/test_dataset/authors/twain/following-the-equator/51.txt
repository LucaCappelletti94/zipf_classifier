Let me make the superstitions of a nation and I care not who makes itslaws or its songs either. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Yes, the city of Benares is in effect just a big church, a religioushive, whose every cell is a temple, a shrine or a mosque, and whose everyconceivable earthly and heavenly good is procurable under one roof, so tospeak--a sort of Army and Navy Stores, theologically stocked.
I will make out a little itinerary for the pilgrim; then you will see howhandy the system is, how convenient, how comprehensive. If you go toBenares with a serious desire to spiritually benefit yourself, you willfind it valuable. I got some of the facts from conversations with theRev. Mr. Parker and the others from his Guide to Benares; they aretherefore trustworthy.
1. Purification. At sunrise you must go down to the Ganges and bathe,pray, and drink some of the water. This is for your generalpurification.
2. Protection against Hunger. Next, you must fortify yourself againstthe sorrowful earthly ill just named. This you will do by worshiping fora moment in the Cow Temple. By the door of it you will find an image ofGanesh, son of Shiva; it has the head of an elephant on a human body; itsface and hands are of silver. You will worship it a little, and pass on,into a covered veranda, where you will find devotees reciting from thesacred books, with the help of instructors. In this place are groups ofrude and dismal idols. You may contribute something for their support;then pass into the temple, a grim and stenchy place, for it is populouswith sacred cows and with beggars. You will give something to thebeggars, and "reverently kiss the tails" of such cows as pass along, forthese cows are peculiarly holy, and this act of worship will secure youfrom hunger for the day.
3. "The Poor Man's Friend." You will next worship this god. He is atthe bottom of a stone cistern in the temple of Dalbhyeswar, under theshade of a noble peepul tree on the bluff overlooking the Ganges, so youmust go back to the river. The Poor Man's Friend is the god of materialprosperity in general, and the god of the rain in particular. You willsecure material prosperity, or both, by worshiping him. He is Shiva,under a new alias, and he abides in the bottom of that cistern, in theform of a stone lingam. You pour Ganges water over him, and in returnfor this homage you get the promised benefits. If there is any delayabout the rain, you must pour water in until the cistern is full; therain will then be sure to come.
4. Fever. At the Kedar Ghat you will find a long flight of stone stepsleading down to the river. Half way down is a tank filled with sewage.Drink as much of it as you want. It is for fever.
5. Smallpox. Go straight from there to the central Ghat. At itsupstream end you will find a small whitewashed building, which is atemple sacred to Sitala, goddess of smallpox. Her under-study is there--a rude human figure behind a brass screen. You will worship this forreasons to be furnished presently.
6. The Well of Fate. For certain reasons you will next go and do homageat this well. You will find it in the Dandpan Temple, in the city. Thesunlight falls into it from a square hole in the masonry above. You willapproach it with awe, for your life is now at stake. You will bend overand look. If the fates are propitious, you will see your face picturedin the water far down in the well. If matters have been otherwiseordered, a sudden cloud will mask the sun and you will see nothing. Thismeans that you have not six months to live. If you are already at thepoint of death, your circumstances are now serious. There is no time tolose. Let this world go, arrange for the next one. Handily situated, atyour very elbow, is opportunity for this. You turn and worship the imageof Maha Kal, the Great Fate, and happiness in the life to come issecured. If there is breath in your body yet, you should now make aneffort to get a further lease of the present life. You have a chance.There is a chance for everything in this admirably stocked andwonderfully systemized Spiritual and Temporal Army and Navy Store. Youmust get yourself carried to the
7. Well of Long Life. This is within the precincts of the mouldering andvenerable Briddhkal Temple, which is one of the oldest in Benares. Youpass in by a stone image of the monkey god, Hanuman, and there, among theruined courtyards, you will find a shallow pool of stagnant sewage. Itsmells like the best limburger cheese, and is filthy with the washings ofrotting lepers, but that is nothing, bathe in it; bathe in it gratefullyand worshipfully, for this is the Fountain of Youth; these are the Watersof Long Life. Your gray hairs will disappear, and with them yourwrinkles and your rheumatism, the burdens of care and the weariness ofage, and you will come out young, fresh, elastic, and full of eagernessfor the new race of life. Now will come flooding upon you the manifolddesires that haunt the dear dreams of the morning of life. You will gowhither you will find
8. Fulfillment of Desire. To wit, to the Kameshwar Temple, sacred toShiva as the Lord of Desires. Arrange for yours there. And if you liketo look at idols among the pack and jam of temples, there you will findenough to stock a museum. You will begin to commit sins now with afresh, new vivacity; therefore, it will be well to go frequently to aplace where you can get
9. Temporary Cleansing from Sin. To wit, to the Well of the Earring.You must approach this with the profoundest reverence, for it isunutterably sacred. It is, indeed, the most sacred place in Benares, thevery Holy of Holies, in the estimation of the people. It is a railedtank, with stone stairways leading down to the water. The water is notclean. Of course it could not be, for people are always bathing in it.As long as you choose to stand and look, you will see the files ofsinners descending and ascending--descending soiled with sin, ascendingpurged from it. "The liar, the thief, the murderer, and the adulterermay here wash and be clean," says the Rev. Mr. Parker, in his book. Verywell. I know Mr. Parker, and I believe it; but if anybody else had saidit, I should consider him a person who had better go down in the tank andtake another wash. The god Vishnu dug this tank. He had nothing to digwith but his "discus." I do not know what a discus is, but I know it is apoor thing to dig tanks with, because, by the time this one was finished,it was full of sweat--Vishnu's sweat. He constructed the site thatBenares stands on, and afterward built the globe around it, and thoughtnothing of it, yet sweated like that over a little thing like this tank.One of these statements is doubtful. I do not know which one it is, butI think it difficult not to believe that a god who could build a worldaround Benares would not be intelligent enough to build it around thetank too, and not have to dig it. Youth, long life, temporarypurification from sin, salvation through propitiation of the Great Fate--these are all good. But you must do something more. You must
10. Make Salvation Sure. There are several ways. To get drowned inthe Ganges is one, but that is not pleasant. To die within the limits ofBenares is another; but that is a risky one, because you might be out oftown when your time came. The best one of all is the Pilgrimage Aroundthe City. You must walk; also, you must go barefoot. The tramp isforty-four miles, for the road winds out into the country a piece, andyou will be marching five or six days. But you will have plenty ofcompany. You will move with throngs and hosts of happy pilgrims whoseradiant costumes will make the spectacle beautiful and whose glad songsand holy pans of triumph will banish your fatigues and cheer your spirit;and at intervals there will be temples where you may sleep and berefreshed with food. The pilgrimage completed, you have purchasedsalvation, and paid for it. But you may not get it unless you
11. Get Your Redemption Recorded. You can get this done at the SakhiBinayak Temple, and it is best to do it, for otherwise you might not beable to prove that you had made the pilgrimage in case the matter shouldsome day come to be disputed. That temple is in a lane back of the CowTemple. Over the door is a red image of Ganesh of the elephant head, sonand heir of Shiva, and Prince of Wales to the Theological Monarchy, so tospeak. Within is a god whose office it is to record your pilgrimage andbe responsible for you. You will not see him, but you will see a Brahminwho will attend to the matter and take the money. If he should forget tocollect the money, you can remind him. He knows that your salvation isnow secure, but of course you would like to know it yourself. You havenothing to do but go and pray, and pay at the
12. Well of the Knowledge of Salvation. It is close to the GoldenTemple. There you will see, sculptured out of a single piece of blackmarble, a bull which is much larger than any living bull you have everseen, and yet is not a good likeness after all. And there also you willsee a very uncommon thing--an image of Shiva. You have seen his lingamfifty thousand times already, but this is Shiva himself, and said to be agood likeness. It has three eyes. He is the only god in the firm thathas three. "The well is covered by a fine canopy of stone supported byforty pillars," and around it you will find what you have already seen atalmost every shrine you have visited in Benares, a mob of devout andeager pilgrims. The sacred water is being ladled out to them; with itcomes to them the knowledge, clear, thrilling, absolute, that they aresaved; and you can see by their faces that there is one happiness in thisworld which is supreme, and to which no other joy is comparable. Youreceive your water, you make your deposit, and now what more would youhave? Gold, diamonds, power, fame? All in a single moment these thingshave withered to dirt, dust, ashes. The world has nothing to give younow. For you it is bankrupt.
I do not claim that the pilgrims do their acts of worship in the orderand sequence above charted out in this Itinerary of mine, but I thinklogic suggests that they ought to do so. Instead of a helter-skelterworship, we then have a definite starting-place, and a march whichcarries the pilgrim steadily forward by reasoned and logical progressionto a definite goal. Thus, his Ganges bath in the early morning gives himan appetite; he kisses the cow-tails, and that removes it. It is nowbusiness hours, and longings for material prosperity rise in his mind,and he goes and pours water over Shiva's symbol; this insures theprosperity, but also brings on a rain, which gives him a fever. Then hedrinks the sewage at the Kedar Ghat to cure the fever; it cures the feverbut gives him the smallpox. He wishes to know how it is going to turnout; he goes to the Dandpan Temple and looks down the well. A cloudedsun shows him that death is near. Logically his best course for thepresent, since he cannot tell at what moment he may die, is to secure ahappy hereafter; this he does, through the agency of the Great Fate. Heis safe, now, for heaven; his next move will naturally be to keep out ofit as long as he can. Therefore he goes to the Briddhkal Temple andsecures Youth and long life by bathing in a puddle of leper-pus whichwould kill a microbe. Logically, Youth has re-equipped him for sin andwith the disposition to commit it; he will naturally go to the fane whichis consecrated to the Fulfillment of Desires, and make arrangements.Logically, he will now go to the Well of the Earring from time to time tounload and freshen up for further banned enjoyments. But first and lastand all the time he is human, and therefore in his reflective intervalshe will always be speculating in "futures." He will make the GreatPilgrimage around the city and so make his salvation absolutely sure; hewill also have record made of it, so that it may remain absolutely sureand not be forgotten or repudiated in the confusion of the FinalSettlement. Logically, also, he will wish to have satisfying andtranquilizing personal knowledge that that salvation is secure; thereforehe goes to the Well of the Knowledge of Salvation, adds that completingdetail, and then goes about his affairs serene and content; serene andcontent, for he is now royally endowed with an advantage which noreligion in this world could give him but his own; for henceforth he maycommit as many million sins as he wants to and nothing can come of it.
Thus the system, properly and logically ordered, is neat, compact,clearly defined, and covers the whole ground. I desire to recommend itto such as find the other systems too difficult, exacting, and irksomefor the uses of this fretful brief life of ours.
However, let me not deceive any one. My Itinerary lacks a detail. Imust put it in. The truth is, that after the pilgrim has faithfullyfollowed the requirements of the Itinerary through to the end and hassecured his salvation and also the personal knowledge of that fact, thereis still an accident possible to him which can annul the whole thing. Ifhe should ever cross to the other side of the Ganges and get caught outand die there he would at once come to life again in the form of an ass.Think of that, after all this trouble and expense. You see howcapricious and uncertain salvation is there. The Hindoo has a childishand unreasoning aversion to being turned into an ass. It is hard to tellwhy. One could properly expect an ass to have an aversion to beingturned into a Hindoo. One could understand that he could lose dignity byit; also self-respect, and nine-tenths of his intelligence. But theHindoo changed into an ass wouldn't lose anything, unless you count hisreligion. And he would gain much--release from his slavery to twomillion gods and twenty million priests, fakeers, holy mendicants, andother sacred bacilli; he would escape the Hindoo hell; he would alsoescape the Hindoo heaven. These are advantages which the Hindoo ought toconsider; then he would go over and die on the other side.
Benares is a religious Vesuvius. In its bowels the theological forceshave been heaving and tossing, rumbling, thundering and quaking, boiling,and weltering and flaming and smoking for ages. But a little group ofmissionaries have taken post at its base, and they have hopes. There arethe Baptist Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society, the LondonMissionary Society, the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and the Zenana Bibleand Medical Mission. They have schools, and the principal work seems tobe among the children. And no doubt that part of the work prospers best,for grown people everywhere are always likely to cling to the religionthey were brought up in.
