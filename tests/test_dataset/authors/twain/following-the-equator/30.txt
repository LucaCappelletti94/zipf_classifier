Nature makes the locust with an appetite for crops; man would have madehim with an appetite for sand. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
We spent part of an afternoon and a night at sea, and reached Bluff, inNew Zealand, early in the morning. Bluff is at the bottom of the middleisland, and is away down south, nearly forty-seven degrees below theequator. It lies as far south of the line as Quebec lies north of it,and the climates of the two should be alike; but for some reason or otherit has not been so arranged. Quebec is hot in the summer and cold in thewinter, but Bluff's climate is less intense; the cold weather is not verycold, the hot weather is not very hot; and the difference between thehottest month and the coldest is but 17 degrees Fahrenheit.
In New Zealand the rabbit plague began at Bluff. The man who introducedthe rabbit there was banqueted and lauded; but they would hang him, now,if they could get him. In England the natural enemy of the rabbit isdetested and persecuted; in the Bluff region the natural enemy of therabbit is honored, and his person is sacred. The rabbit's natural enemyin England is the poacher, in Bluff its natural enemy is the stoat, theweasel, the ferret, the cat, and the mongoose. In England any personbelow the Heir who is caught with a rabbit in his possession mustsatisfactorily explain how it got there, or he will suffer fine andimprisonment, together with extinction of his peerage; in Bluff, the catfound with a rabbit in its possession does not have to explain--everybodylooks the other way; the person caught noticing would suffer fine andimprisonment, with extinction of peerage. This is a sure way toundermine the moral fabric of a cat. Thirty years from now there willnot be a moral cat in New Zealand. Some think there is none there now.In England the poacher is watched, tracked, hunted--he dare not show hisface; in Bluff the cat, the weasel, the stoat, and the mongoose go up anddown, whither they will, unmolested. By a law of the legislature, postedwhere all may read, it is decreed that any person found in possession ofone of these creatures (dead) must satisfactorily explain thecircumstances or pay a fine of not less than L5, nor more than L20. Therevenue from this source is not large. Persons who want to pay a hundreddollars for a dead cat are getting rarer and rarer every day. This isbad, for the revenue was to go to the endowment of a University. Allgovernments are more or less short-sighted: in England they fine thepoacher, whereas he ought to be banished to New Zealand. New Zealandwould pay his way, and give him wages.
It was from Bluff that we ought to have cut across to the west coast andvisited the New Zealand Switzerland, a land of superb scenery, made up ofsnowy grandeurs, anal mighty glaciers, and beautiful lakes; and overthere, also, are the wonderful rivals of the Norwegian and Alaskanfiords; and for neighbor, a waterfall of 1,900 feet; but we were obligedto postpone the trip to some later and indefinite time.
November 6. A lovely summer morning; brilliant blue sky. A few milesout from Invercargill, passed through vast level green expanses snowedover with sheep. Fine to see. The green, deep and very vivid sometimes;at other times less so, but delicate and lovely. A passenger reminds methat I am in "the England of the Far South."
Dunedin, same date. The town justifies Michael Davitt's praises.The people are Scotch. They stopped here on their way from home toheaven-thinking they had arrived. The population is stated at 40,000, byMalcolm Ross, journalist; stated by an M. P. at 60,000. A journalistcannot lie.
To the residence of Dr. Hockin. He has a fine collection of booksrelating to New Zealand; and his house is a museum of Maori art andantiquities. He has pictures and prints in color of many native chiefsof the past--some of them of note in history. There is nothing of thesavage in the faces; nothing could be finer than these men's features,nothing more intellectual than these faces, nothing more masculine,nothing nobler than their aspect. The aboriginals of Australia andTasmania looked the savage, but these chiefs looked like Romanpatricians. The tattooing in these portraits ought to suggest thesavage, of course, but it does not. The designs are so flowing andgraceful and beautiful that they are a most satisfactory decoration. Ittakes but fifteen minutes to get reconciled to the tattooing, and butfifteen more to perceive that it is just the thing. After that, theundecorated European face is unpleasant and ignoble.
Dr. Hockiu gave us a ghastly curiosity--a lignified caterpillar with aplant growing out of the back of its neck--a plant with a slender stem 4inches high. It happened not by accident, but by design--Nature'sdesign. This caterpillar was in the act of loyally carrying out a lawinflicted upon him by Nature--a law purposely inflicted upon him to gethim into trouble--a law which was a trap; in pursuance of this law hemade the proper preparations for turning himself into a night-moth; thatis to say, he dug a little trench, a little grave, and then stretchedhimself out in it on his stomach and partially buried himself--thenNature was ready for him. She blew the spores of a peculiar fungusthrough the air with a purpose. Some of them fell into a crease in theback of the caterpillar's neck, and began to sprout and grow--for therewas soil there--he had not washed his neck. The roots forced themselvesdown into the worm's person, and rearward along through its body, suckingup the creature's juices for sap; the worm slowly died, and turned towood. And here he was now, a wooden caterpillar, with every detail ofhis former physique delicately and exactly preserved and perpetuated, andwith that stem standing up out of him for his monument--monumentcommemorative of his own loyalty and of Nature's unfair return for it.
Nature is always acting like that. Mrs. X. said (of course) that thecaterpillar was not conscious and didn't suffer. She should have knownbetter. No caterpillar can deceive Nature. If this one couldn't suffer,Nature would have known it and would have hunted up another caterpillar.Not that she would have let this one go, merely because it was defective.No. She would have waited and let him turn into a night-moth; and thenfried him in the candle.
Nature cakes a fish's eyes over with parasites, so that it shan't be ableto avoid its enemies or find its food. She sends parasites into astar-fish's system, which clog up its prongs and swell them and make themso uncomfortable that the poor creature delivers itself from the prong toease its misery; and presently it has to part with another prong for thesake of comfort, and finally with a third. If it re-grows the prongs,the parasite returns and the same thing is repeated. And finally, whenthe ability to reproduce prongs is lost through age, that poor oldstar-fish can't get around any more, and so it dies of starvation.
In Australia is prevalent a horrible disease due to an "unperfectedtapeworm." Unperfected--that is what they call it, I do not know why,for it transacts business just as well as if it were finished andfrescoed and gilded, and all that.
November 9. To the museum and public picture gallery with the presidentof the Society of Artists. Some fine pictures there, lent by the S. ofA. several of them they bought, the others came to them by gift. Next,to the gallery of the S. of A.--annual exhibition--just opened. Fine.Think of a town like this having two such collections as this, and aSociety of Artists. It is so all over Australasia. If it were amonarchy one might understand it. I mean an absolute monarchy, where itisn't necessary to vote money, but take it. Then art flourishes. Butthese colonies are republics--republics with a wide suffrage; voters ofboth sexes, this one of New Zealand. In republics, neither thegovernment nor the rich private citizen is much given to propagating art.All over Australasia pictures by famous European artists are bought forthe public galleries by the State and by societies of citizens. Livingcitizens--not dead ones. They rob themselves to give, not their heirs.This S. of A. here owns its buildings built it by subscription.
