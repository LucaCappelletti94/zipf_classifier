I am glad to know that you are all well, in San Bernardino.
. . . That grandchild of yours has been here - well, I do not quiteknow how many days it is; nobody can keep account of days oranything else where she is!  Mother, she did what the Indians werenever able to do.  She took the Fort - took it the first day!  Tookme, too; took the colonels, the captains, the women, the children,and the dumb brutes; took Buffalo Bill, and all his scouts; tookthe garrison - to the last man; and in forty-eight hours the Indianencampment was hers, illustrious old Thunder-Bird and all.  Do Iseem to have lost my solemnity, my gravity, my poise, my dignity?You would lose your own, in my circumstances.  Mother, you neversaw such a winning little devil.  She is all energy, and spirit,and sunshine, and interest in everybody and everything, and poursout her prodigal love upon every creature that will take it, highor low, Christian or pagan, feathered or furred; and none hasdeclined it to date, and none ever will, I think.  But she has atemper, and sometimes it catches fire and flames up, and is likelyto burn whatever is near it; but it is soon over, the passion goesas quickly as it comes.  Of course she has an Indian name already;Indians always rechristen a stranger early.  Thunder-Bird attendedto her case.  He gave her the Indian equivalent for firebug, orfire-fly.  He said:
"'Times, ver' quiet, ver' soft, like summer night, but when she madshe blaze."
Isn't it good?  Can't you see the flare?  She's beautiful, mother,beautiful as a picture; and there is a touch of you in her face,and of her father - poor George! and in her unresting activities,and her fearless ways, and her sunbursts and cloudbursts, she isalways bringing George back to me.  These impulsive natures aredramatic.  George was dramatic, so is this Lightning-Bug, so isBuffalo Bill.  When Cathy first arrived - it was in the forenoon -Buffalo Bill was away, carrying orders to Major Fuller, at FiveForks, up in the Clayton Hills.  At mid-afternoon I was at my desk,trying to work, and this sprite had been making it impossible forhalf an hour.  At last I said:
"Oh, you bewitching little scamp, CAN'T you be quiet just a minuteor two, and let your poor old uncle attend to a part of hisduties?"
"I'll try, uncle; I will, indeed," she said.
"Well, then, that's a good child - kiss me.  Now, then, sit up inthat chair, and set your eye on that clock.  There - that's right.If you stir - if you so much as wink - for four whole minutes, I'llbite you!"
It was very sweet and humble and obedient she looked, sittingthere, still as a mouse; I could hardly keep from setting her freeand telling her to make as much racket as she wanted to.  During asmuch as two minutes there was a most unnatural and heavenly quietand repose, then Buffalo Bill came thundering up to the door in allhis scout finery, flung himself out of the saddle, said to hishorse, "Wait for me, Boy," and stepped in, and stopped dead in histracks - gazing at the child.  She forgot orders, and was on thefloor in a moment, saying:
"Oh, you are so beautiful!  Do you like me?"
"No, I don't, I love you!" and he gathered her up with a hug, andthen set her on his shoulder - apparently nine feet from the floor.
She was at home.  She played with his long hair, and admired hisbig hands and his clothes and his carbine, and asked question afterquestion, as fast as he could answer, until I excused them both forhalf an hour, in order to have a chance to finish my work.  Then Iheard Cathy exclaiming over Soldier Boy; and he was worthy of herraptures, for he is a wonder of a horse, and has a reputation whichis as shining as his own silken hide.
