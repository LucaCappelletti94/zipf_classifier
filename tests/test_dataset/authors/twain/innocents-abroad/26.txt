What is it that confers the noblest delight?  What is that which swells aman's breast with pride above that which any other experience can bringto him?  Discovery!  To know that you are walking where none others havewalked; that you are beholding what human eye has not seen before; thatyou are breathing a virgin atmosphere.  To give birth to an idea--todiscover a great thought--an intellectual nugget, right under the dust ofa field that many a brain--plow had gone over before.  To find a newplanet, to invent a new hinge, to find the way to make the lightningscarry your messages.  To be the first--that is the idea.  To dosomething, say something, see something, before any body else--these arethe things that confer a pleasure compared with which other pleasures aretame and commonplace, other ecstasies cheap and trivial.  Morse, with hisfirst message, brought by his servant, the lightning; Fulton, in thatlong-drawn century of suspense, when he placed his hand upon thethrottle-valve and lo, the steamboat moved; Jenner, when his patient withthe cow's virus in his blood, walked through the smallpox hospitalsunscathed; Howe, when the idea shot through his brain that for a hundredand twenty generations the eye had been bored through the wrong end ofthe needle; the nameless lord of art who laid down his chisel in some oldage that is forgotten, now, and gloated upon the finished Laocoon;Daguerre, when he commanded the sun, riding in the zenith, to print thelandscape upon his insignificant silvered plate, and he obeyed; Columbus,in the Pinta's shrouds, when he swung his hat above a fabled sea andgazed abroad upon an unknown world!  These are the men who have reallylived--who have actually comprehended what pleasure is--who have crowdedlong lifetimes of ecstasy into a single moment.
What is there in Rome for me to see that others have not seen before me?What is there for me to touch that others have not touched?  What isthere for me to feel, to learn, to hear, to know, that shall thrill mebefore it pass to others?  What can I discover?--Nothing.  Nothingwhatsoever.  One charm of travel dies here.  But if I were only a Roman!--If, added to my own I could be gifted with modern Roman sloth, modernRoman superstition, and modern Roman boundlessness of ignorance, whatbewildering worlds of unsuspected wonders I would discover!  Ah, if Iwere only a habitant of the Campagna five and twenty miles from Rome!Then I would travel.
I would go to America, and see, and learn, and return to the Campagna andstand before my countrymen an illustrious discoverer.  I would say:
"I saw there a country which has no overshadowing Mother Church, and yetthe people survive.  I saw a government which never was protected byforeign soldiers at a cost greater than that required to carry on thegovernment itself.  I saw common men and common women who could read;I even saw small children of common country people reading from books;if I dared think you would believe it, I would say they could write,also.
"In the cities I saw people drinking a delicious beverage made of chalkand water, but never once saw goats driven through their Broadway ortheir Pennsylvania Avenue or their Montgomery street and milked at thedoors of the houses.  I saw real glass windows in the houses of even thecommonest people.  Some of the houses are not of stone, nor yet ofbricks; I solemnly swear they are made of wood.  Houses there will takefire and burn, sometimes--actually burn entirely down, and not leave asingle vestige behind.  I could state that for a truth, upon mydeath-bed.  And as a proof that the circumstance is not rare, I averthat they have a thing which they call a fire-engine, which vomits forthgreat streams of water, and is kept always in readiness, by night and byday, to rush to houses that are burning.  You would think one enginewould be sufficient, but some great cities have a hundred; they keep menhired, and pay them by the month to do nothing but put out fires.  For acertain sum of money other men will insure that your house shall notburn down; and if it burns they will pay you for it.  There are hundredsand thousands of schools, and any body may go and learn to be wise, likea priest.  In that singular country if a rich man dies a sinner, he isdamned; he can not buy salvation with money for masses.  There is reallynot much use in being rich, there.  Not much use as far as the otherworld is concerned, but much, very much use, as concerns this; becausethere, if a man be rich, he is very greatly honored, and can become alegislator, a governor, a general, a senator, no matter how ignorant anass he is--just as in our beloved Italy the nobles hold all the greatplaces, even though sometimes they are born noble idiots.  There, if aman be rich, they give him costly presents, they ask him to feasts, theyinvite him to drink complicated beverages; but if he be poor and indebt, they require him to do that which they term to 'settle.'  Thewomen put on a different dress almost every day; the dress is usuallyfine, but absurd in shape; the very shape and fashion of it changestwice in a hundred years; and did I but covet to be called anextravagant falsifier, I would say it changed even oftener.  Hair doesnot grow upon the American women's heads; it is made for them by cunningworkmen in the shops, and is curled and frizzled into scandalous andungodly forms. Some persons wear eyes of glass which they see throughwith facility perhaps, else they would not use them; and in the mouthsof some are teeth made by the sacrilegious hand of man.  The dress ofthe men is laughably grotesque.  They carry no musket in ordinary life,nor no long-pointed pole; they wear no wide green-lined cloak; they wearno peaked black felt hat, no leathern gaiters reaching to the knee, nogoat-skin breeches with the hair side out, no hob-nailed shoes, noprodigious spurs.  They wear a conical hat termed a 'nail-keg;' a coatof saddest black; a shirt which shows dirt so easily that it has to bechanged every month, and is very troublesome; things called pantaloons,which are held up by shoulder straps, and on their feet they wear bootswhich are ridiculous in pattern and can stand no wear.  Yet dressed inthis fantastic garb, these people laughed at my costume.  In thatcountry, books are so common that it is really no curiosity to see one.Newspapers also.  They have a great machine which prints such things bythousands every hour.
"I saw common men, there--men who were neither priests nor princes--whoyet absolutely owned the land they tilled.  It was not rented from thechurch, nor from the nobles.  I am ready to take my oath of this.  Inthat country you might fall from a third story window three severaltimes, and not mash either a soldier or a priest.--The scarcity of suchpeople is astonishing.  In the cities you will see a dozen civilians forevery soldier, and as many for every priest or preacher.  Jews, there,are treated just like human beings, instead of dogs.  They can work atany business they please; they can sell brand new goods if they want to;they can keep drug-stores; they can practice medicine among Christians;they can even shake hands with Christians if they choose; they canassociate with them, just the same as one human being does with anotherhuman being; they don't have to stay shut up in one corner of the towns;they can live in any part of a town they like best; it is said they evenhave the privilege of buying land and houses, and owning them themselves,though I doubt that, myself; they never have had to run races nakedthrough the public streets, against jackasses, to please the people incarnival time; there they never have been driven by the soldiers into achurch every Sunday for hundreds of years to hear themselves and theirreligion especially and particularly cursed; at this very day, in thatcurious country, a Jew is allowed to vote, hold office, yea, get up on arostrum in the public street and express his opinion of the government ifthe government don't suit him!  Ah, it is wonderful.  The common peoplethere know a great deal; they even have the effrontery to complain ifthey are not properly governed, and to take hold and help conduct thegovernment themselves; if they had laws like ours, which give one dollarof every three a crop produces to the government for taxes, they wouldhave that law altered: instead of paying thirty-three dollars in taxes,out of every one hundred they receive, they complain if they have to payseven.  They are curious people.  They do not know when they are welloff.  Mendicant priests do not prowl among them with baskets begging forthe church and eating up their substance.  One hardly ever sees aminister of the gospel going around there in his bare feet, with abasket, begging for subsistence.  In that country the preachers are notlike our mendicant orders of friars--they have two or three suits ofclothing, and they wash sometimes.  In that land are mountains far higherthan the Alban mountains; the vast Roman Campagna, a hundred miles longand full forty broad, is really small compared to the United States ofAmerica; the Tiber, that celebrated river of ours, which stretches itsmighty course almost two hundred miles, and which a lad can scarcelythrow a stone across at Rome, is not so long, nor yet so wide, as theAmerican Mississippi--nor yet the Ohio, nor even the Hudson.  In Americathe people are absolutely wiser and know much more than theirgrandfathers did.  They do not plow with a sharpened stick, nor yet witha three-cornered block of wood that merely scratches the top of theground.  We do that because our fathers did, three thousand years ago, Isuppose.  But those people have no holy reverence for their ancestors.They plow with a plow that is a sharp, curved blade of iron, and it cutsinto the earth full five inches.  And this is not all.  They cut theirgrain with a horrid machine that mows down whole fields in a day.  If Idared, I would say that sometimes they use a blasphemous plow that worksby fire and vapor and tears up an acre of ground in a single hour--but--but--I see by your looks that you do not believe the things I am tellingyou.  Alas, my character is ruined, and I am a branded speaker ofuntruths!"
Of course we have been to the monster Church of St. Peter, frequently.I knew its dimensions.  I knew it was a prodigious structure.  I knew itwas just about the length of the capitol at Washington--say seven hundredand thirty feet.  I knew it was three hundred and sixty-four feet wide,and consequently wider than the capitol.  I knew that the cross on thetop of the dome of the church was four hundred and thirty-eight feetabove the ground, and therefore about a hundred or may be a hundred andtwenty-five feet higher than the dome of the capitol.--Thus I had onegauge.  I wished to come as near forming a correct idea of how it wasgoing to look, as possible; I had a curiosity to see how much I woulderr.  I erred considerably.  St. Peter's did not look nearly so large asthe capitol, and certainly not a twentieth part as beautiful, from theoutside.
When we reached the door, and stood fairly within the church, it wasimpossible to comprehend that it was a very large building.  I had tocipher a comprehension of it.  I had to ransack my memory for some moresimiles.  St. Peter's is bulky.  Its height and size would represent twoof the Washington capitol set one on top of the other--if the capitolwere wider; or two blocks or two blocks and a half of ordinary buildingsset one on top of the other.  St. Peter's was that large, but it couldand would not look so.  The trouble was that every thing in it and aboutit was on such a scale of uniform vastness that there were no contraststo judge by--none but the people, and I had not noticed them.  They wereinsects.  The statues of children holding vases of holy water wereimmense, according to the tables of figures, but so was every thing elsearound them.  The mosaic pictures in the dome were huge, and were made ofthousands and thousands of cubes of glass as large as the end of mylittle finger, but those pictures looked smooth, and gaudy of color, andin good proportion to the dome.  Evidently they would not answer tomeasure by.  Away down toward the far end of the church (I thought it wasreally clear at the far end, but discovered afterward that it was in thecentre, under the dome,) stood the thing they call the baldacchino--agreat bronze pyramidal frame-work like that which upholds a mosquito bar.It only looked like a considerably magnified bedstead--nothing more.  YetI knew it was a good deal more than half as high as Niagara Falls.  Itwas overshadowed by a dome so mighty that its own height was snubbed.The four great square piers or pillars that stand equidistant from eachother in the church, and support the roof, I could not work up to theirreal dimensions by any method of comparison.  I knew that the faces ofeach were about the width of a very large dwelling-house front, (fifty orsixty feet,) and that they were twice as high as an ordinary three-storydwelling, but still they looked small.  I tried all the different ways Icould think of to compel myself to understand how large St. Peter's was,but with small success.  The mosaic portrait of an Apostle who waswriting with a pen six feet long seemed only an ordinary Apostle.
But the people attracted my attention after a while.  To stand in thedoor of St. Peter's and look at men down toward its further extremity,two blocks away, has a diminishing effect on them; surrounded by theprodigious pictures and statues, and lost in the vast spaces, they lookvery much smaller than they would if they stood two blocks away in theopen air.  I "averaged" a man as he passed me and watched him as hedrifted far down by the baldacchino and beyond--watched him dwindle to aninsignificant school-boy, and then, in the midst of the silent throng ofhuman pigmies gliding about him, I lost him.  The church had lately beendecorated, on the occasion of a great ceremony in honor of St. Peter, andmen were engaged, now, in removing the flowers and gilt paper from thewalls and pillars.  As no ladders could reach the great heights, the menswung themselves down from balustrades and the capitals of pilasters byropes, to do this work.  The upper gallery which encircles the innersweep of the dome is two hundred and forty feet above the floor of thechurch--very few steeples in America could reach up to it.  Visitorsalways go up there to look down into the church because one gets the bestidea of some of the heights and distances from that point.  While westood on the floor one of the workmen swung loose from that gallery atthe end of a long rope.  I had not supposed, before, that a man couldlook so much like a spider.  He was insignificant in size, and his ropeseemed only a thread.  Seeing that he took up so little space, I couldbelieve the story, then, that ten thousand troops went to St. Peter's,once, to hear mass, and their commanding officer came afterward, and notfinding them, supposed they had not yet arrived.  But they were in thechurch, nevertheless--they were in one of the transepts.  Nearly fiftythousand persons assembled in St. Peter's to hear the publishing of thedogma of the Immaculate Conception.  It is estimated that the floor ofthe church affords standing room for--for a large number of people; Ihave forgotten the exact figures.  But it is no matter--it is nearenough.
They have twelve small pillars, in St. Peter's, which came from Solomon'sTemple.  They have, also--which was far more interesting to me--a pieceof the true cross, and some nails, and a part of the crown of thorns.
Of course we ascended to the summit of the dome, and of course we alsowent up into the gilt copper ball which is above it.--There was roomthere for a dozen persons, with a little crowding, and it was as closeand hot as an oven.  Some of those people who are so fond of writingtheir names in prominent places had been there before us--a million ortwo, I should think.  From the dome of St. Peter's one can see everynotable object in Rome, from the Castle of St. Angelo to the Coliseum.He can discern the seven hills upon which Rome is built.  He can see theTiber, and the locality of the bridge which Horatius kept "in the bravedays of old" when Lars Porsena attempted to cross it with his invadinghost.  He can see the spot where the Horatii and the Curatii fought theirfamous battle.  He can see the broad green Campagna, stretching awaytoward the mountains, with its scattered arches and broken aqueducts ofthe olden time, so picturesque in their gray ruin, and so daintilyfestooned with vines.  He can see the Alban Mountains, the Appenines, theSabine Hills, and the blue Mediterranean.  He can see a panorama that isvaried, extensive, beautiful to the eye, and more illustrious in historythan any other in Europe.--About his feet is spread the remnant of acity that once had a population of four million souls; and among itsmassed edifices stand the ruins of temples, columns, and triumphal archesthat knew the Caesars, and the noonday of Roman splendor; and close bythem, in unimpaired strength, is a drain of arched and heavy masonry thatbelonged to that older city which stood here before Romulus and Remuswere born or Rome thought of.  The Appian Way is here yet, and lookingmuch as it did, perhaps, when the triumphal processions of the Emperorsmoved over it in other days bringing fettered princes from the confinesof the earth.  We can not see the long array of chariots and mail-cladmen laden with the spoils of conquest, but we can imagine the pageant,after a fashion.  We look out upon many objects of interest from the domeof St. Peter's; and last of all, almost at our feet, our eyes rest uponthe building which was once the Inquisition.  How times changed, betweenthe older ages and the new!  Some seventeen or eighteen centuries ago,the ignorant men of Rome were wont to put Christians in the arena of theColiseum yonder, and turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show.  Itwas for a lesson as well.  It was to teach the people to abhor and fearthe new doctrine the followers of Christ were teaching.  The beasts torethe victims limb from limb and made poor mangled corpses of them in thetwinkling of an eye.  But when the Christians came into power, when theholy Mother Church became mistress of the barbarians, she taught them theerror of their ways by no such means.  No, she put them in this pleasantInquisition and pointed to the Blessed Redeemer, who was so gentle and somerciful toward all men, and they urged the barbarians to love him; andthey did all they could to persuade them to love and honor him--first bytwisting their thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by nipping theirflesh with pincers--red-hot ones, because they are the most comfortablein cold weather; then by skinning them alive a little, and finally byroasting them in public.  They always convinced those barbarians.  Thetrue religion, properly administered, as the good Mother Church used toadminister it, is very, very soothing.  It is wonderfully persuasive,also.  There is a great difference between feeding parties to wild beastsand stirring up their finer feelings in an Inquisition.  One is thesystem of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened, civilizedpeople.  It is a great pity the playful Inquisition is no more.
I prefer not to describe St. Peter's.  It has been done before.  Theashes of Peter, the disciple of the Saviour, repose in a crypt under thebaldacchino.  We stood reverently in that place; so did we also in theMamertine Prison, where he was confined, where he converted the soldiers,and where tradition says he caused a spring of water to flow in orderthat he might baptize them.  But when they showed us the print of Peter'sface in the hard stone of the prison wall and said he made that byfalling up against it, we doubted.  And when, also, the monk at thechurch of San Sebastian showed us a paving-stone with two greatfootprints in it and said that Peter's feet made those, we lackedconfidence again.  Such things do not impress one.  The monk said thatangels came and liberated Peter from prison by night, and he started awayfrom Rome by the Appian Way.  The Saviour met him and told him to goback, which he did.  Peter left those footprints in the stone upon whichhe stood at the time.  It was not stated how it was ever discovered whosefootprints they were, seeing the interview occurred secretly and atnight.  The print of the face in the prison was that of a man of commonsize; the footprints were those of a man ten or twelve feet high.  Thediscrepancy confirmed our unbelief.
We necessarily visited the Forum, where Caesar was assassinated, and alsothe Tarpeian Rock.  We saw the Dying Gladiator at the Capitol, and Ithink that even we appreciated that wonder of art; as much, perhaps, aswe did that fearful story wrought in marble, in the Vatican--the Laocoon.And then the Coliseum.
Every body knows the picture of the Coliseum; every body recognizes atonce that "looped and windowed" band-box with a side bitten out.  Beingrather isolated, it shows to better advantage than any other of themonuments of ancient Rome.  Even the beautiful Pantheon, whose paganaltars uphold the cross, now, and whose Venus, tricked out in consecratedgimcracks, does reluctant duty as a Virgin Mary to-day, is built aboutwith shabby houses and its stateliness sadly marred.  But the monarch ofall European ruins, the Coliseum, maintains that reserve and that royalseclusion which is proper to majesty.  Weeds and flowers spring from itsmassy arches and its circling seats, and vines hang their fringes fromits lofty walls.  An impressive silence broods over the monstrousstructure where such multitudes of men and women were wont to assemble inother days.  The butterflies have taken the places of the queens offashion and beauty of eighteen centuries ago, and the lizards sunthemselves in the sacred seat of the Emperor.  More vividly than all thewritten histories, the Coliseum tells the story of Rome's grandeur andRome's decay.  It is the worthiest type of both that exists.  Movingabout the Rome of to-day, we might find it hard to believe in her oldmagnificence and her millions of population; but with this stubbornevidence before us that she was obliged to have a theatre with sittingroom for eighty thousand persons and standing room for twenty thousandmore, to accommodate such of her citizens as required amusement, we findbelief less difficult.  The Coliseum is over one thousand six hundredfeet long, seven hundred and fifty wide, and one hundred and sixty-fivehigh.  Its shape is oval.
In America we make convicts useful at the same time that we punish themfor their crimes.  We farm them out and compel them to earn money for theState by making barrels and building roads.  Thus we combine businesswith retribution, and all things are lovely.  But in ancient Rome theycombined religious duty with pleasure.  Since it was necessary that thenew sect called Christians should be exterminated, the people judged itwise to make this work profitable to the State at the same time, andentertaining to the public.  In addition to the gladiatorial combats andother shows, they sometimes threw members of the hated sect into thearena of the Coliseum and turned wild beasts in upon them.  It isestimated that seventy thousand Christians suffered martyrdom in thisplace.  This has made the Coliseum holy ground, in the eyes of thefollowers of the Saviour.  And well it might; for if the chain that bounda saint, and the footprints a saint has left upon a stone he chanced tostand upon, be holy, surely the spot where a man gave up his life for hisfaith is holy.
Seventeen or eighteen centuries ago this Coliseum was the theatre ofRome, and Rome was mistress of the world.  Splendid pageants wereexhibited here, in presence of the Emperor, the great ministers of State,the nobles, and vast audiences of citizens of smaller consequence.Gladiators fought with gladiators and at times with warrior prisonersfrom many a distant land.  It was the theatre of Rome--of the world--andthe man of fashion who could not let fall in a casual and unintentionalmanner something about "my private box at the Coliseum" could not move inthe first circles.  When the clothing-store merchant wished to consumethe corner grocery man with envy, he bought secured seats in the frontrow and let the thing be known.  When the irresistible dry goods clerkwished to blight and destroy, according to his native instinct, he gothimself up regardless of expense and took some other fellow's young ladyto the Coliseum, and then accented the affront by cramming her with icecream between the acts, or by approaching the cage and stirring up themartyrs with his whalebone cane for her edification.  The Roman swell wasin his true element only when he stood up against a pillar and fingeredhis moustache unconscious of the ladies; when he viewed the bloodycombats through an opera-glass two inches long; when he excited the envyof provincials by criticisms which showed that he had been to theColiseum many and many a time and was long ago over the novelty of it;when he turned away with a yawn at last and said,
"He a star! handles his sword like an apprentice brigand! he'll do forthe country, may be, but he don't answer for the metropolis!"
Glad was the contraband that had a seat in the pit at the Saturdaymatinee, and happy the Roman street-boy who ate his peanuts and guyed thegladiators from the dizzy gallery.
For me was reserved the high honor of discovering among the rubbish ofthe ruined Coliseum the only playbill of that establishment now extant.There was a suggestive smell of mint-drops about it still, a corner of ithad evidently been chewed, and on the margin, in choice Latin, thesewords were written in a delicate female hand:
     "Meet me on the Tarpeian Rock tomorrow evening, dear, at sharp     seven.  Mother will be absent on a visit to her friends in the     Sabine Hills.        CLAUDIA."
Ah, where is that lucky youth to-day, and where the little hand thatwrote those dainty lines?  Dust and ashes these seventeen hundred years!
Thus reads the bill:
                            ROMAN COLISEUM.                        UNPARALLELED ATTRACTION!               NEW PROPERTIES!  NEW LIONS!  NEW GLADIATORS!                       Engagement of the renowned                        MARCUS MARCELLUS VALERIAN!                           FOR SIX NIGHTS ONLY!

It was as singular as it was gratifying that I was also so fortunate asto find among the rubbish of the arena, a stained and mutilated copy ofthe Roman Daily Battle-Ax, containing a critique upon this veryperformance.  It comes to hand too late by many centuries to rank asnews, and therefore I translate and publish it simply to show how verylittle the general style and phraseology of dramatic criticism hasaltered in the ages that have dragged their slow length along since thecarriers laid this one damp and fresh before their Roman patrons:
     "THE OPENING SEASON.--COLISEUM.--Notwithstanding the inclemency of     the weather, quite a respectable number of the rank and fashion of     the city assembled last night to witness the debut upon metropolitan     boards of the young tragedian who has of late been winning such     golden opinions in the amphitheatres of the provinces.  Some sixty     thousand persons were present, and but for the fact that the streets     were almost impassable, it is fair to presume that the house would     have been full.  His august Majesty, the Emperor Aurelius, occupied     the imperial box, and was the cynosure of all eyes.  Many     illustrious nobles and generals of the Empire graced the occasion     with their presence, and not the least among them was the young     patrician lieutenant whose laurels, won in the ranks of the     "Thundering Legion," are still so green upon his brow.  The cheer     which greeted his entrance was heard beyond the Tiber!
     "The late repairs and decorations add both to the comeliness and the     comfort of the Coliseum.  The new cushions are a great improvement     upon the hard marble seats we have been so long accustomed to.  The     present management deserve well of the public.  They have restored     to the Coliseum the gilding, the rich upholstery and the uniform     magnificence which old Coliseum frequenters tell us Rome was so     proud of fifty years ago.
     "The opening scene last night--the broadsword combat between two     young amateurs and a famous Parthian gladiator who was sent here a     prisoner--was very fine.  The elder of the two young gentlemen     handled his weapon with a grace that marked the possession of     extraordinary talent.  His feint of thrusting, followed instantly by     a happily delivered blow which unhelmeted the Parthian, was received     with hearty applause.  He was not thoroughly up in the backhanded     stroke, but it was very gratifying to his numerous friends to know     that, in time, practice would have overcome this defect.  However,     he was killed.  His sisters, who were present, expressed     considerable regret.  His mother left the Coliseum.  The other youth     maintained the contest with such spirit as to call forth     enthusiastic bursts of applause.  When at last he fell a corpse, his     aged mother ran screaming, with hair disheveled and tears streaming     from her eyes, and swooned away just as her hands were clutching at     the railings of the arena.  She was promptly removed by the police.     Under the circumstances the woman's conduct was pardonable, perhaps,     but we suggest that such exhibitions interfere with the decorum     which should be preserved during the performances, and are highly     improper in the presence of the Emperor.  The Parthian prisoner     fought bravely and well; and well he might, for he was fighting for     both life and liberty.  His wife and children were there to nerve     his arm with their love, and to remind him of the old home he should     see again if he conquered.  When his second assailant fell, the     woman clasped her children to her breast and wept for joy.  But it     was only a transient happiness.  The captive staggered toward her     and she saw that the liberty he had earned was earned too late.  He     was wounded unto death.  Thus the first act closed in a manner which     was entirely satisfactory.  The manager was called before the     curtain and returned his thanks for the honor done him, in a speech     which was replete with wit and humor, and closed by hoping that his     humble efforts to afford cheerful and instructive entertainment     would continue to meet with the approbation of the Roman public
     "The star now appeared, and was received with vociferous applause     and the simultaneous waving of sixty thousand handkerchiefs.  Marcus     Marcellus Valerian (stage name--his real name is Smith,) is a     splendid specimen of physical development, and an artist of rare     merit.  His management of the battle-ax is wonderful.  His gayety     and his playfulness are irresistible, in his comic parts, and yet     they are inferior to his sublime conceptions in the grave realm of     tragedy.  When his ax was describing fiery circles about the heads     of the bewildered barbarians, in exact time with his springing body     and his prancing legs, the audience gave way to uncontrollable     bursts of laughter; but when the back of his weapon broke the skull     of one and almost in the same instant its edge clove the other's     body in twain, the howl of enthusiastic applause that shook the     building, was the acknowledgment of a critical assemblage that he     was a master of the noblest department of his profession.  If he has     a fault, (and we are sorry to even intimate that he has,) it is that     of glancing at the audience, in the midst of the most exciting     moments of the performance, as if seeking admiration.  The pausing     in a fight to bow when bouquets are thrown to him is also in bad     taste.  In the great left-handed combat he appeared to be looking at     the audience half the time, instead of carving his adversaries; and     when he had slain all the sophomores and was dallying with the     freshman, he stooped and snatched a bouquet as it fell, and offered     it to his adversary at a time when a blow was descending which     promised favorably to be his death-warrant.  Such levity is proper     enough in the provinces, we make no doubt, but it ill suits the     dignity of the metropolis.  We trust our young friend will take     these remarks in good part, for we mean them solely for his benefit.     All who know us are aware that although we are at times justly     severe upon tigers and martyrs, we never intentionally offend     gladiators.
     "The Infant Prodigy performed wonders.  He overcame his four tiger     whelps with ease, and with no other hurt than the loss of a portion     of his scalp.  The General Slaughter was rendered with a     faithfulness to details which reflects the highest credit upon the     late participants in it.
     "Upon the whole, last night's performances shed honor not only upon     the management but upon the city that encourages and sustains such     wholesome and instructive entertainments.  We would simply suggest     that the practice of vulgar young boys in the gallery of shying     peanuts and paper pellets at the tigers, and saying "Hi-yi!" and     manifesting approbation or dissatisfaction by such observations as     "Bully for the lion!"  "Go it, Gladdy!"  "Boots!"  "Speech!"  "Take     a walk round the block!"  and so on, are extremely reprehensible,     when the Emperor is present, and ought to be stopped by the police.     Several times last night, when the supernumeraries entered the arena     to drag out the bodies, the young ruffians in the gallery shouted,     "Supe! supe!"  and also, "Oh, what a coat!"  and "Why don't you pad     them shanks?"  and made use of various other remarks expressive of     derision.  These things are very annoying to the audience.
     "A matinee for the little folks is promised for this afternoon, on     which occasion several martyrs will be eaten by the tigers.  The     regular performance will continue every night till further notice.     Material change of programme every evening.  Benefit of Valerian,     Tuesday, 29th, if he lives."
I have been a dramatic critic myself, in my time, and I was oftensurprised to notice how much more I knew about Hamlet than Forrest did;and it gratifies me to observe, now, how much better my brethren ofancient times knew how a broad sword battle ought to be fought than thegladiators.
