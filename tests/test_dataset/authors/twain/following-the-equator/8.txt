It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is nodistinctly native American criminal class except Congress. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

When one glances at the map the members of the stupendous islandwilderness of the Pacific seem to crowd upon each other; but no, there isno crowding, even in the center of a group; and between groups there arelonely wide deserts of sea.  Not everything is known about the islands,their peoples and their languages.  A startling reminder of this isfurnished by the fact that in Fiji, twenty years ago, were living twostrange and solitary beings who came from an unknown country and spoke anunknown language.  "They were picked up by a passing vessel many hundredsof miles from any known land, floating in the same tiny canoe in whichthey had been blown out to sea.  When found they were but skin and bone.No one could understand what they said, and they have never named theircountry; or, if they have, the name does not correspond with that of anyisland on any chart.  They are now fat and sleek, and as happy as the dayis long.  In the ship's log there is an entry of the latitude andlongitude in which they were found, and this is probably all the cluethey will ever have to their lost homes."--[Forbes's "Two Years inFiji."]
What a strange and romantic episode it is; and how one is tortured withcuriosity to know whence those mysterious creatures came, those MenWithout a Country, errant waifs who cannot name their lost home,wandering Children of Nowhere.
Indeed, the Island Wilderness is the very home of romance and dreams andmystery.  The loneliness, the solemnity, the beauty, and the deep reposeof this wilderness have a charm which is all their own for the bruisedspirit of men who have fought and failed in the struggle for life in thegreat world; and for men who have been hunted out of the great world forcrime; and for other men who love an easy and indolent existence; and forothers who love a roving free life, and stir and change and adventure;and for yet others who love an easy and comfortable career of trading andmoney-getting, mixed with plenty of loose matrimony by purchase, divorcewithout trial or expense, and limitless spreeing thrown in to make lifeideally perfect.
We sailed again, refreshed.
The most cultivated person in the ship was a young English, man whosehome was in New Zealand.  He was a naturalist.  His learning in hisspecialty was deep and thorough, his interest in his subject amounted toa passion, he had an easy gift of speech; and so, when he talked aboutanimals it was a pleasure to listen to him.  And profitable, too, thoughhe was sometimes difficult to understand because now and then he usedscientific technicalities which were above the reach of some of us.  Theywere pretty sure to be above my reach, but as he was quite willing toexplain them I always made it a point to get him to do it.  I had a fairknowledge of his subject--layman's knowledge--to begin with, but it washis teachings which crystalized it into scientific form and clarity--in aword, gave it value.
His special interest was the fauna of Australasia, and his knowledge ofthe matter was as exhaustive as it was accurate.  I already knew a gooddeal about the rabbits in Australasia and their marvelous fecundity, butin my talks with him I found that my estimate of the great hindrance andobstruction inflicted by the rabbit pest upon traffic and travel was farshort of the facts.  He told me that the first pair of rabbits importedinto Australasia bred so wonderfully that within six months rabbits wereso thick in the land that people had to dig trenches through them to getfrom town to town.
He told me a great deal about worms, and the kangaroo, and othercoleoptera, and said he knew the history and ways of all suchpachydermata.  He said the kangaroo had pockets, and carried its young inthem when it couldn't get apples.  And he said that the emu was as big asan ostrich, and looked like one, and had an amorphous appetite and wouldeat bricks.  Also, that the dingo was not a dingo at all, but just a wilddog; and that the only difference between a dingo and a dodo was thatneither of them barked; otherwise they were just the same.  He said thatthe only game-bird in Australia was the wombat, and the only song-birdthe larrikin, and that both were protected by government.  The mostbeautiful of the native birds was the bird of Paradise.  Next came thetwo kinds of lyres; not spelt the same.  He said the one kind was dyingout, the other thickening up.  He explained that the "Sundowner" was nota bird it was a man; sundowner was merely the Australian equivalent ofour word, tramp.  He is a loafer, a hard drinker, and a sponge.  Hetramps across the country in the sheep-shearing season, pretending tolook for work; but he always times himself to arrive at a sheep-run justat sundown, when the day's labor ends; all he wants is whisky and supperand bed and breakfast; he gets them and then disappears.  The naturalistspoke of the bell bird, the creature that at short intervals all dayrings out its mellow and exquisite peal from the deeps of the forest.  Itis the favorite and best friend of the weary and thirsty sundowner; forhe knows that wherever the bell bird is, there is water; and he goessomewhere else.  The naturalist said that the oddest bird in Australasiawas the Laughing Jackass, and the biggest the now extinct Great Moa.
The Moa stood thirteen feet high, and could step over an ordinary man'shead or kick his hat off; and his head, too, for that matter.  He said itwas wingless, but a swift runner.  The natives used to ride it.  It couldmake forty miles an hour, and keep it up for four hundred miles and comeout reasonably fresh.  It was still in existence when the railway wasintroduced into New Zealand; still in existence, and carrying the mails.The railroad began with the same schedule it has now: two expresses aweek-time, twenty miles an hour.  The company exterminated the moa to getthe mails.
Speaking of the indigenous coneys and bactrian camels, the naturalistsaid that the coniferous and bacteriological output of Australasia wasremarkable for its many and curious departures from the accepted lawsgoverning these species of tubercles, but that in his opinion Nature'sfondness for dabbling in the erratic was most notably exhibited in thatcurious combination of bird, fish, amphibian, burrower, crawler,quadruped, and Christian called the Ornithorhynchus--grotesquest ofanimals, king of the animalculae of the world for versatility ofcharacter and make-up.  Said he:
     "You can call it anything you want to, and be right.  It is a fish,     for it lives in the river half the time; it is a land animal, for it     resides on the land half the time; it is an amphibian, since it     likes both and does not know which it prefers; it is a hybernian,     for when times are dull and nothing much going on it buries itself     under the mud at the bottom of a puddle and hybernates there a     couple of weeks at a time; it is a kind of duck, for it has a     duck-bill and four webbed paddles; it is a fish and quadruped     together, for in the water it swims with the paddles and on shore it     paws itself across country with them; it is a kind of seal, for it     has a seal's fur; it is carnivorous, herbivorous, insectivorous, and     vermifuginous, for it eats fish and grass and butterflies, and in     the season digs worms out of the mud and devours them; it is clearly     a bird, for it lays eggs, and hatches them; it is clearly a mammal,     for it nurses its young; and it is manifestly a kind of Christian,     for it keeps the Sabbath when there is anybody around, and when     there isn't, doesn't.  It has all the tastes there are except     refined ones, it has all the habits there are except good ones.
     "It is a survival--a survival of the fittest.  Mr. Darwin invented     the theory that goes by that name, but the Ornithorhynchus was the     first to put it to actual experiment and prove that it could be     done.  Hence it should have as much of the credit as Mr. Darwin.     It was never in the Ark; you will find no mention of it there; it     nobly stayed out and worked the theory.  Of all creatures in the     world it was the only one properly equipped for the test.  The Ark     was thirteen months afloat, and all the globe submerged; no land     visible above the flood, no vegetation, no food for a mammal to eat,     nor water for a mammal to drink; for all mammal food was destroyed,     and when the pure floods from heaven and the salt oceans of the     earth mingled their waters and rose above the mountain tops, the     result was a drink which no bird or beast of ordinary construction     could use and live.  But this combination was nuts for the     Ornithorhynchus, if I may use a term like that without offense.     Its river home had always been salted by the flood-tides of the sea.     On the face of the Noachian deluge innumerable forest trees were     floating.  Upon these the Ornithorhynchus voyaged in peace; voyaged     from clime to clime, from hemisphere to hemisphere, in contentment     and comfort, in virile interest in the constant change Of scene, in     humble thankfulness for its privileges, in ever-increasing     enthusiasm in the development of the great theory upon whose     validity it had staked its life, its fortunes, and its sacred honor,     if I may use such expressions without impropriety in connection with     an episode of this nature.
     "It lived the tranquil and luxurious life of a creature of     independent means.  Of things actually necessary to its existence     and its happiness not a detail was wanting.  When it wished to walk,     it scrambled along the tree-trunk; it mused in the shade of the     leaves by day, it slept in their shelter by night; when it wanted     the refreshment of a swim, it had it; it ate leaves when it wanted a     vegetable diet, it dug under the bark for worms and grubs; when it     wanted fish it caught them, when it wanted eggs it laid them.  If     the grubs gave out in one tree it swam to another; and as for fish,     the very opulence of the supply was an embarrassment.  And finally,     when it was thirsty it smacked its chops in gratitude over a blend     that would have slain a crocodile.
     "When at last, after thirteen months of travel and research in all     the Zones it went aground on a mountain-summit, it strode ashore,     saying in its heart, 'Let them that come after me invent theories     and dream dreams about the Survival of the Fittest if they like, but     I am the first that has done it!
     "This wonderful creature dates back like the kangaroo and many other     Australian hydrocephalous invertebrates, to an age long anterior to     the advent of man upon the earth; they date back, indeed, to a time     when a causeway hundreds of miles wide, and thousands of miles long,     joined Australia to Africa, and the animals of the two countries     were alike, and all belonged to that remote geological epoch known     to science as the Old Red Grindstone Post-Pleosaurian.  Later the     causeway sank under the sea; subterranean convulsions lifted the     African continent a thousand feet higher than it was before, but     Australia kept her old level.  In Africa's new climate the animals     necessarily began to develop and shade off into new forms and     families and species, but the animals of Australia as necessarily     remained stationary, and have so remained until this day.  In the     course of some millions of years the African Ornithorhynchus     developed and developed and developed, and sluffed off detail after     detail of its make-up until at last the creature became wholly     disintegrated and scattered.  Whenever you see a bird or a beast or     a seal or an otter in Africa you know that he is merely a sorry     surviving fragment of that sublime original of whom I have been     speaking--that creature which was everything in general and nothing     in particular--the opulently endowed 'e pluribus unum' of the animal     world.
     "Such is the history of the most hoary, the most ancient, the most     venerable creature that exists in the earth today--Ornithorhynchus     Platypus Extraordinariensis--whom God preserve!"
When he was strongly moved he could rise and soar like that with ease.And not only in the prose form, but in the poetical as well.  He hadwritten many pieces of poetry in his time, and these manuscripts he lentaround among the passengers, and was willing to let them be copied.  Itseemed to me that the least technical one in the series, and the onewhich reached the loftiest note, perhaps, was his:
               INVOCATION.
     "Come forth from thy oozy couch,     O Ornithorhynchus dear!     And greet with a cordial claw     The stranger that longs to hear
     "From thy own own lips the tale     Of thy origin all unknown:     Thy misplaced bone where flesh should be     And flesh where should be bone;
     "And fishy fin where should be paw,     And beaver-trowel tail,     And snout of beast equip'd with teeth     Where gills ought to prevail.
     "Come, Kangaroo, the good and true     Foreshortened as to legs,     And body tapered like a churn,     And sack marsupial, i' fegs,
     "And tells us why you linger here,     Thou relic of a vanished time,     When all your friends as fossils sleep,     Immortalized in lime!"
Perhaps no poet is a conscious plagiarist; but there seems to be warrantfor suspecting that there is no poet who is not at one time or another anunconscious one.  The above verses are indeed beautiful, and, in a way,touching; but there is a haunting something about them which unavoidablysuggests the Sweet Singer of Michigan.  It can hardly be doubted that theauthor had read the works of that poet and been impressed by them.  It isnot apparent that he has borrowed from them any word or yet any phrase,but the style and swing and mastery and melody of the Sweet Singer allare there.  Compare this Invocation with "Frank Dutton"--particularlystanzas first and seventeenth--and I think the reader will feel convincedthat he who wrote the one had read the other:
     I.
    "Frank Dutton was as fine a lad     As ever you wish to see,     And he was drowned in Pine Island Lake     On earth no more will he be,     His age was near fifteen years,     And he was a motherless boy,     He was living with his grandmother     When he was drowned, poor boy."
     XVII.
    "He was drowned on Tuesday afternoon,     On Sunday he was found,     And the tidings of that drowned boy     Was heard for miles around.     His form was laid by his mother's side,     Beneath the cold, cold ground,     His friends for him will drop a tear     When they view his little mound."
