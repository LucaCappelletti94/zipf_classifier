Grief can take care of itself; but to get the full value of a joy youmust have somebody to divide it with. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
We left Bombay for Allahabad by a night train. It is the custom of thecountry to avoid day travel when it can conveniently be done. But thereis one trouble: while you can seemingly "secure" the two lower berths bymaking early application, there is no ticket as witness of it, and noother producible evidence in case your proprietorship shall chance to bechallenged. The word "engaged" appears on the window, but it doesn'tstate who the compartment is engaged, for. If your Satan and your Barneyarrive before somebody else's servants, and spread the bedding on the twosofas and then stand guard till you come, all will be well; but if theystep aside on an errand, they may find the beds promoted to the twoshelves, and somebody else's demons standing guard over their master'sbeds, which in the meantime have been spread upon your sofas.
You do not pay anything extra for your sleeping place; that is where thetrouble lies. If you buy a fare-ticket and fail to use it, there is roomthus made available for someone else; but if the place were secured toyou it would remain vacant, and yet your ticket would secure you anotherplace when you were presently ready to travel.
However, no explanation of such a system can make it seem quite rationalto a person who has been used to a more rational system. If our peoplehad the arranging of it, we should charge extra for securing the place,and then the road would suffer no loss if the purchaser did not occupyit.
The present system encourages good manners--and also discourages them.If a young girl has a lower berth and an elderly lady comes in, it isusual for the girl to offer her place to this late comer; and it is usualfor the late comer to thank her courteously and take it. But the thinghappens differently sometimes. When we were ready to leave Bombay mydaughter's satchels were holding possession of her berth--a lower one.At the last moment, a middle-aged American lady swarmed into thecompartment, followed by native porters laden with her baggage. She wasgrowling and snarling and scolding, and trying to make herselfphenomenally disagreeable; and succeeding. Without a word, she hoistedthe satchels into the hanging shelf, and took possession of that lowerberth.
On one of our trips Mr. Smythe and I got out at a station to walk up anddown, and when we came back Smythe's bed was in the hanging shelf and anEnglish cavalry officer was in bed on the sofa which he had lately beenoccupying. It was mean to be glad about it, but it is the way we aremade; I could not have been gladder if it had been my enemy that hadsuffered this misfortune. We all like to see people in trouble, if itdoesn't cost us anything. I was so happy over Mr. Smythe's chagrin thatI couldn't go to sleep for thinking of it and enjoying it. I knew hesupposed the officer had committed the robbery himself, whereas without adoubt the officer's servant had done it without his knowledge. Mr.Smythe kept this incident warm in his heart, and longed for a chance toget even with somebody for it. Sometime afterward the opportunity came,in Calcutta. We were leaving on a 24-hour journey to Darjeeling. Mr.Barclay, the general superintendent, has made special provision for ouraccommodation, Mr. Smythe said; so there was no need to hurry aboutgetting to the train; consequently, we were a little late.
When we arrived, the usual immense turmoil and confusion of a greatIndian station were in full blast. It was an immoderately long train,for all the natives of India were going by it somewhither, and the nativeofficials were being pestered to frenzy by belated and anxious people.They didn't know where our car was, and couldn't remember having receivedany orders about it. It was a deep disappointment; moreover, it lookedas if our half of our party would be left behind altogether. Then Satancame running and said he had found a compartment with one shelf and onesofa unoccupied, and had made our beds and had stowed our baggage. Werushed to the place, and just as the train was ready to pull out and theporters were slamming the doors to, all down the line, an officer of theIndian Civil Service, a good friend of ours, put his head in and said:--
"I have been hunting for you everywhere. What are you doing here? Don'tyou know----"
The train started before he could finish. Mr. Smythe's opportunity wascome. His bedding, on the shelf, at once changed places with thebedding--a stranger's--that was occupying the sofa that was opposite tomine. About ten o'clock we stopped somewhere, and a large Englishman ofofficial military bearing stepped in. We pretended to be asleep. Thelamps were covered, but there was light enough for us to note his look ofsurprise. He stood there, grand and fine, peering down at Smythe, andwondering in silence at the situation. After a bit he said:--
"Well!" And that was all.
But that was enough. It was easy to understand. It meant: "This isextraordinary. This is high-handed. I haven't had an experience likethis before."
He sat down on his baggage, and for twenty minutes we watched him throughour eyelashes, rocking and swaying there to the motion of the train.Then we came to a station, and he got up and went out, muttering: "I mustfind a lower berth, or wait over." His servant came presently and carriedaway his things.
Mr. Smythe's sore place was healed, his hunger for revenge was satisfied.But he couldn't sleep, and neither could I; for this was a venerable old.car, and nothing about it was taut. The closet door slammed all night,and defied every fastening we could invent. We got up very much jaded,at dawn, and stepped out at a way station; and, while we were taking acup of coffee, that Englishman ranged up alongside, and somebody said tohim:
"So you didn't stop off, after all?"
"No. The guard found a place for me that had been, engaged and notoccupied. I had a whole saloon car all to myself--oh, quite palatial!I never had such luck in my life."
That was our car, you see. We moved into it, straight off, the familyand all. But I asked the English gentleman to remain, and he did. Apleasant man, an infantry colonel; and doesn't know, yet, that Smytherobbed him of his berth, but thinks it was done by Smythe's servantwithout Smythe's knowledge. He was assisted in gathering thisimpression.
The Indian trains are manned by natives exclusively. The Indian stationsexcept very large and important ones--are manned entirely by natives, andso are the posts and telegraphs. The rank and file of the police arenatives. All these people are pleasant and accommodating. One day Ileft an express train to lounge about in that perennially ravishing show,the ebb and flow and whirl of gaudy natives, that is always surging upand down the spacious platform of a great Indian station; and I lostmyself in the ecstasy of it, and when I turned, the train was movingswiftly away. I was going to sit down and wait for another train, as Iwould have done at home; I had no thought of any other course. But anative official, who had a green flag in his hand, saw me, and saidpolitely:
"Don't you belong in the train, sir?"
"Yes." I said.
He waved his flag, and the train came back! And he put me aboard with asmuch ceremony as if I had been the General Superintendent. They arekindly people, the natives. The face and the bearing that indicate asurly spirit and a bad heart seemed to me to be so rare among Indians--sonearly non-existent, in fact--that I sometimes wondered if Thuggee wasn'ta dream, and not a reality. The bad hearts are there, but I believe thatthey are in a small, poor minority. One thing is sure: They are much themost interesting people in the world--and the nearest to beingincomprehensible. At any rate, the hardest to account for. Theircharacter and their history, their customs and their religion, confrontyou with riddles at every turn-riddles which are a trifle more perplexingafter they are explained than they were before. You can get the facts ofa custom--like caste, and Suttee, and Thuggee, and so on--and with thefacts a theory which tries to explain, but never quite does it to yoursatisfaction. You can never quite understand how so strange a thingcould have been born, nor why.
For instance--the Suttee. This is the explanation of it:
A woman who throws away her life when her husband dies is instantlyjoined to him again, and is forever afterward happy with him in heaven;her family will build a little monument to her, or a temple, and willhold her in honor, and, indeed, worship her memory always; they willthemselves be held in honor by the public; the woman's self-sacrifice hasconferred a noble and lasting distinction upon her posterity. And,besides, see what she has escaped: If she had elected to live, she wouldbe a disgraced person; she could not remarry; her family would despiseher and disown her; she would be a friendless outcast, and miserable allher days.
Very well, you say, but the explanation is not complete yet. How didpeople come to drift into such a strange custom? What was the origin ofthe idea? "Well, nobody knows; it was probably a revelation sent down bythe gods." One more thing: Why was such a cruel death chosen--whywouldn't a gentle one have answered? "Nobody knows; maybe that was arevelation, too."
No--you can never understand it. It all seems impossible. You resolveto believe that a widow never burnt herself willingly, but went to herdeath because she was afraid to defy public opinion. But you are notable to keep that position. History drives you from it. Major Sleemanhas a convincing case in one of his books. In his government on theNerbudda he made a brave attempt on the 28th of March, 1828, to put downSuttee on his own hook and without warrant from the Supreme Government ofIndia. He could not foresee that the Government would put it down itselfeight months later. The only backing he had was a bold nature and acompassionate heart. He issued his proclamation abolishing the Suttee inhis district. On the morning of Tuesday--note the day of the week--the24th of the following November, Ummed Singh Upadhya, head of the mostrespectable and most extensive Brahmin family in the district, died, andpresently came a deputation of his sons and grandsons to beg that his oldwidow might be allowed to burn herself upon his pyre. Sleeman threatenedto enforce his order, and punish severely any man who assisted; and heplaced a police guard to see that no one did so. From the early morningthe old widow of sixty-five had been sitting on the bank of the sacredriver by her dead, waiting through the long hours for the permission; andat last the refusal came instead. In one little sentence Sleeman givesyou a pathetic picture of this lonely old gray figure: all day and allnight "she remained sitting by the edge of the water without eating ordrinking." The next morning the body of the husband was burned to ashesin a pit eight feet square and three or four feet deep, in the view ofseveral thousand spectators. Then the widow waded out to a bare rock inthe river, and everybody went away but her sons and other relations. Allday she sat there on her rock in the blazing sun without food or drink,and with no clothing but a sheet over her shoulders.
The relatives remained with her and all tried to persuade her to desistfrom her purpose, for they deeply loved her. She steadily refused. Thena part of the family went to Sleeman's house, ten miles away, and triedagain to get him to let her burn herself. He refused, hoping to save heryet.
All that day she scorched in her sheet on the rock, and all that nightshe kept her vigil there in the bitter cold. Thursday morning, in thesight of her relatives, she went through a ceremonial which said more tothem than any words could have done; she put on the dhaja (a coarse redturban) and broke her bracelets in pieces. By these acts she became adead person in the eye of the law, and excluded from her caste forever.By the iron rule of ancient custom, if she should now choose to live shecould never return to her family. Sleeman was in deep trouble. If shestarved herself to death her family would be disgraced; and, moreover,starving would be a more lingering misery than the death by fire. Hewent back in the evening thoroughly worried. The old woman remained onher rock, and there in the morning he found her with her dhaja still onher head. "She talked very collectedly, telling me that she haddetermined to mix her ashes with those of her departed husband, andshould patiently wait my permission to do so, assured that God wouldenable her to sustain life till that was given, though she dared not eator drink. Looking at the sun, then rising before her over a long andbeautiful reach of the river, she said calmly, 'My soul has been for fivedays with my husband's near that sun; nothing but my earthly frame isleft; and this, I know, you will in time suffer to be mixed with hisashes in yonder pit, because it is not in your nature or usage wantonlyto prolong the miseries of a poor old woman.'"
He assured her that it was his desire and duty to save her, and to urgeher to live, and to keep her family from the disgrace of being thoughther murderers. But she said she "was not afraid of their being thoughtso; that they had all, like good children, done everything in their powerto induce her to live, and to abide with them; and if I should consent Iknow they would love and honor me, but my duties to them have now ended.I commit them all to your care, and I go to attend my husband, UmmedSingh Upadhya, with whose ashes on the funeral pile mine have beenalready three times mixed."
She believed that she and he had been upon the earth three several timesas wife and husband, and that she had burned herself to death three timesupon his pyre. That is why she said that strange thing. Since she hadbroken her bracelets and put on the red turban she regarded herself as acorpse; otherwise she would not have allowed herself to do her husbandthe irreverence of pronouncing his name. "This was the first time in herlong life that she had ever uttered her husband's name, for in India nowoman, high or low, ever pronounces the name of her husband."
Major Sleeman still tried to shake her purpose. He promised to build hera fine house among the temples of her ancestors upon the bank of theriver and make handsome provision for her out of rent-free lands if shewould consent to live; and if she wouldn't he would allow no stone orbrick to ever mark the place where she died. But she only smiled andsaid, "My pulse has long ceased to beat, my spirit has departed; I shallsuffer nothing in the burning; and if you wish proof, order some fire andyou shall see this arm consumed without giving me any pain."
Sleeman was now satisfied that he could not alter her purpose. He sentfor all the chief members of the family and said he would suffer her toburn herself if they would enter into a written engagement to abandon thesuttee in their family thenceforth. They agreed; the papers were drawnout and signed, and at noon, Saturday, word was sent to the poor oldwoman. She seemed greatly pleased. The ceremonies of bathing were gonethrough with, and by three o'clock she was ready and the fire was brisklyburning in the pit. She had now gone without food or drink during morethan four days and a half. She came ashore from her rock, first wettingher sheet in the waters of the sacred river, for without that safeguardany shadow which might fall upon her would convey impurity to her; thenshe walked to the pit, leaning upon one of her sons and a nephew--thedistance was a hundred and fifty yards.
"I had sentries placed all around, and no other person was allowed toapproach within five paces. She came on with a calm and cheerfulcountenance, stopped once, and casting her eyes upwards, said, 'Why havethey kept me five days from thee, my husband?' On coming to the sentriesher supporters stopped and remained standing; she moved on, and walkedonce around the pit, paused a moment, and while muttering a prayer, threwsome flowers into the fire. She then walked up deliberately and steadilyto the brink, stepped into the centre of the flame, sat down, and leaningback in the midst as if reposing upon a couch, was consumed withoututtering a shriek or betraying one sign of agony."
It is fine and beautiful. It compels one's reverence and respect--no,has it freely, and without compulsion. We see how the custom, oncestarted, could continue, for the soul of it is that stupendous power,Faith; faith brought to the pitch of effectiveness by the cumulativeforce of example and long use and custom; but we cannot understand howthe first widows came to take to it. That is a perplexing detail.
Sleeman says that it was usual to play music at the suttee, but that thewhite man's notion that this was to drown the screams of the martyr isnot correct; that it had a quite different purpose. It was believed thatthe martyr died prophecying; that the prophecies sometimes foretolddisaster, and it was considered a kindness to those upon whom it was tofall to drown the voice and keep them in ignorance of the misfortune thatwas to come.
