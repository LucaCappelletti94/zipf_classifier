It takes your enemy and your friend, working together, to hurt you to theheart; the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Out of the town again; a long drive through open country, by windingroads among secluded villages nestling in the inviting shade of tropicvegetation, a Sabbath stillness everywhere, sometimes a pervading senseof solitude, but always barefoot natives gliding by like spirits, withoutsound of footfall, and others in the distance dissolving away andvanishing like the creatures of dreams. Now and then a string of statelycamels passed by--always interesting things to look at--and they werevelvet-shod by nature, and made no noise. Indeed, there were no noisesof any sort in this paradise. Yes, once there was one, for a moment: afile of native convicts passed along in charge of an officer, and wecaught the soft clink of their chains. In a retired spot, restinghimself under a tree, was a holy person--a naked black fakeer, thin andskinny, and whitey-gray all over with ashes.
By and by to the elephant stables, and I took a ride; but it was byrequest--I did not ask for it, and didn't want it; but I took it, becauseotherwise they would have thought I was afraid, which I was. Theelephant kneels down, by command--one end of him at a time--and you climbthe ladder and get into the howdah, and then he gets up, one end at atime, just as a ship gets up over a wave; and after that, as he stridesmonstrously about, his motion is much like a ship's motion. The mahoutbores into the back of his head with a great iron prod and you wonder athis temerity and at the elephant's patience, and you think that perhapsthe patience will not last; but it does, and nothing happens. The mahouttalks to the elephant in a low voice all the time, and the elephant seemsto understand it all and to be pleased with it; and he obeys every orderin the most contented and docile way. Among these twenty-five elephantswere two which were larger than any I had ever seen before, and if I hadthought I could learn to not be afraid, I would have taken one of themwhile the police were not looking.
In the howdah-house there were many howdahs that were made of silver, oneof gold, and one of old ivory, and equipped with cushions and canopies ofrich and costly stuffs. The wardrobe of the elephants was there, too;vast velvet covers stiff and heavy with gold embroidery; and bells ofsilver and gold; and ropes of these metals for fastening the things onharness, so to speak; and monster hoops of massive gold for the elephantto wear on his ankles when he is out in procession on business of state.
But we did not see the treasury of crown jewels, and that was adisappointment, for in mass and richness it ranks only second in India.By mistake we were taken to see the new palace instead, and we used upthe last remnant of our spare time there. It was a pity, too; for thenew palace is mixed modern American-European, and has not a merit exceptcostliness. It is wholly foreign to India, and impudent and out ofplace. The architect has escaped. This comes of overdoing thesuppression of the Thugs; they had their merits. The old palace isoriental and charming, and in consonance with the country. The oldpalace would still be great if there were nothing of it but the spaciousand lofty hall where the durbars are held. It is not a good place tolecture in, on account of the echoes, but it is a good place to holddurbars in and regulate the affairs of a kingdom, and that is what it isfor. If I had it I would have a durbar every day, instead of once ortwice a year.
The prince is an educated gentleman. His culture is European. He hasbeen in Europe five times. People say that this is costly amusement forhim, since in crossing the sea he must sometimes be obliged to drinkwater from vessels that are more or less public, and thus damage hiscaste. To get it purified again he must make pilgrimage to some renownedHindoo temples and contribute a fortune or two to them. His people arelike the other Hindoos, profoundly religious; and they could not becontent with a master who was impure.
We failed to see the jewels, but we saw the gold cannon and the silverone--they seemed to be six-pounders. They were not designed forbusiness, but for salutes upon rare and particularly important stateoccasions. An ancestor of the present Gaikwar had the silver one made,and a subsequent ancestor had the gold one made, in order to outdo him.
This sort of artillery is in keeping with the traditions of Baroda, whichwas of old famous for style and show. It used to entertain visitingrajahs and viceroys with tiger-fights, elephant-fights, illuminations,and elephant-processions of the most glittering and gorgeous character.
It makes the circus a pale, poor thing.
In the train, during a part of the return journey from Baroda, we had thecompany of a gentleman who had with him a remarkable looking dog. I hadnot seen one of its kind before, as far as I could remember; though ofcourse I might have seen one and not noticed it, for I am not acquaintedwith dogs, but only with cats. This dog's coat was smooth and shiny andblack, and I think it had tan trimmings around the edges of the dog, andperhaps underneath. It was a long, low dog, with very short, strangelegs--legs that curved inboard, something like parentheses wrong way (.Indeed, it was made on the plan of a bench for length and lowness. Itseemed to be satisfied, but I thought the plan poor, and structurallyweak, on account of the distance between the forward supports and thoseabaft. With age the dog's back was likely to sag; and it seemed to methat it would have been a stronger and more practicable dog if it had hadsome more legs. It had not begun to sag yet, but the shape of the legsshowed that the undue weight imposed upon them was beginning to tell.It had a long nose, and floppy ears that hung down, and a resignedexpression of countenance. I did not like to ask what kind of a dog itwas, or how it came to be deformed, for it was plain that the gentlemanwas very fond of it, and naturally he could be sensitive about it. Fromdelicacy I thought it best not to seem to notice it too much. No doubt aman with a dog like that feels just as a person does who has a child thatis out of true. The gentleman was not merely fond of the dog, he wasalso proud of it--just the same again, as a mother feels about herchild when it is an idiot. I could see that he was proud of it,not-withstanding it was such a long dog and looked so resigned and pious.It had been all over the world with him, and had been pilgriming likethat for years and years. It had traveled 50,000 miles by sea and rail,and had ridden in front of him on his horse 8,000. It had a silver medalfrom the Geographical Society of Great Britain for its travels, and I sawit. It had won prizes in dog shows, both in India and in England--I sawthem. He said its pedigree was on record in the Kennel Club, and that itwas a well-known dog. He said a great many people in London couldrecognize it the moment they saw it. I did not say anything, but I didnot think it anything strange; I should know that dog again, myself, yetI am not careful about noticing dogs. He said that when he walked alongin London, people often stopped and looked at the dog. Of course I didnot say anything, for I did not want to hurt his feelings, but I couldhave explained to him that if you take a great long low dog like that andwaddle it along the street anywhere in the world and not charge anything,people will stop and look. He was gratified because the dog took prizes.But that was nothing; if I were built like that I could take prizesmyself. I wished I knew what kind of a dog it was, and what it was for,but I could not very well ask, for that would show that I did not know.Not that I want a dog like that, but only to know the secret of itsbirth.
I think he was going to hunt elephants with it, because I know, fromremarks dropped by him, that he has hunted large game in India andAfrica, and likes it. But I think that if he tries to hunt elephantswith it, he is going to be disappointed.
I do not believe that it is suited for elephants. It lacks energy, itlacks force of character, it lacks bitterness. These things all show inthe meekness and resignation of its expression. It would not attack anelephant, I am sure of it. It might not run if it saw one coming, but itlooked to me like a dog that would sit down and pray.
I wish he had told me what breed it was, if there are others; but I shallknow the dog next time, and then if I can bring myself to it I will putdelicacy aside and ask. If I seem strangely interested in dogs, I have areason for it; for a dog saved me from an embarrassing position once, andthat has made me grateful to these animals; and if by study I could learnto tell some of the kinds from the others, I should be greatly pleased.I only know one kind apart, yet, and that is the kind that saved me thattime. I always know that kind when I meet it, and if it is hungry orlost I take care of it. The matter happened in this way:
It was years and years ago. I had received a note from Mr. Augustin Dalyof the Fifth Avenue Theatre, asking me to call the next time I should bein New York. I was writing plays, in those days, and he was admiringthem and trying to get me a chance to get them played in Siberia. I tookthe first train--the early one--the one that leaves Hartford at 8.29 inthe morning. At New Haven I bought a paper, and found it filled withglaring display-lines about a "bench-show" there. I had often heard ofbench-shows, but had never felt any interest in them, because I supposedthey were lectures that were not well attended. It turned out, now, thatit was not that, but a dog-show. There was a double-leaded column aboutthe king-feature of this one, which was called a Saint Bernard, and wasworth $10,000, and was known to be the largest and finest of his speciesin the world. I read all this with interest, because out of myschool-boy readings I dimly remembered how the priests and pilgrims ofSt. Bernard used to go out in the storms and dig these dogs out of thesnowdrifts when lost and exhausted, and give them brandy and save theirlives, and drag them to the monastery and restore them with gruel.
Also, there was a picture of this prize-dog in the paper, a noble greatcreature with a benignant countenance, standing by a table. He wasplaced in that way so that one could get a right idea of his greatdimensions. You could see that he was just a shade higher than thetable--indeed, a huge fellow for a dog. Then there was a descriptionwhich event into the details. It gave his enormous weight--150 1/2pounds, and his length 4 feet 2 inches, from stem to stern-post; and hisheight--3 feet 1 inch, to the top of his back. The pictures and thefigures so impressed me, that I could see the beautiful colossus beforeme, and I kept on thinking about him for the next two hours; then Ireached New York, and he dropped out of my mind.
In the swirl and tumult of the hotel lobby I ran across Mr. Daly'scomedian, the late James Lewis, of beloved memory, and I casuallymentioned that I was going to call upon Mr. Daly in the evening at 8.He looked surprised, and said he reckoned not. For answer I handed himMr. Daly's note. Its substance was: "Come to my private den, over thetheater, where we cannot be interrupted. And come by the back way, notthe front. No. 642 Sixth Avenue is a cigar shop; pass through it and youare in a paved court, with high buildings all around; enter the seconddoor on the left, and come up stairs."
"Is this all?"
"Yes," I said.
"Well, you'll never get in"
"Why?"
"Because you won't. Or if you do you can draw on me for a hundreddollars; for you will be the first man that has accomplished it intwenty-five years. I can't think what Mr. Daly can have been absorbedin. He has forgotten a most important detail, and he will feelhumiliated in the morning when he finds that you tried to get in andcouldn't."
"Why, what is the trouble?"
"I'll tell you. You see----"
At that point we were swept apart by the crowd, somebody detained me witha moment's talk, and we did not get together again. But it did notmatter; I believed he was joking, anyway.
At eight in the evening I passed through the cigar shop and into thecourt and knocked at the second door.
"Come in!"
I entered. It was a small room, carpetless, dusty, with a naked dealtable, and two cheap wooden chairs for furniture. A giant Irishman wasstanding there, with shirt collar and vest unbuttoned, and no coat on. Iput my hat on the table, and was about to say something, when theIrishman took the innings himself. And not with marked courtesy of tone:
"Well, sor, what will you have?"
I was a little disconcerted, and my easy confidence suffered a shrinkage.The man stood as motionless as Gibraltar, and kept his unblinking eyeupon me. It was very embarrassing, very humiliating. I stammered at afalse start or two; then----
"I have just run down from----"
"Av ye plaze, ye'll not smoke here, ye understand."
I laid my cigar on the window-ledge; chased my flighty thoughts a moment,then said in a placating manner:
"I--I have come to see Mr. Daly."
"Oh, ye have, have ye?"
"Yes"
"Well, ye'll not see him."
"But he asked me to come."
"Oh, he did, did he?"
"Yes, he sent me this note, and----"
"Lemme see it."
For a moment I fancied there would be a change in the atmosphere, now;but this idea was premature. The big man was examining the notesearchingly under the gas-jet. A glance showed me that he had it upsidedown--disheartening evidence that he could not read.
"Is ut his own handwrite?"
"Yes--he wrote it himself."
"He did, did he?"
"Yes."
"H'm. Well, then, why ud he write it like that?"
"How do you mean?"
"I mane, why wudn't he put his naime to ut?"
"His name is to it. That's not it--you are looking at my name."
I thought that that was a home shot, but he did not betray that he hadbeen hit. He said:
"It's not an aisy one to spell; how do you pronounce ut?"
"Mark Twain."
"H'm. H'm. Mike Train. H'm. I don't remember ut. What is it ye wantto see him about?"
"It isn't I that want to see him, he wants to see me."
"Oh, he does, does he?"
"Yes."
"What does he want to see ye about?"
"I don't know."
"Ye don't know! And ye confess it, becod! Well, I can tell ye wanthing--ye'll not see him. Are ye in the business?"
"What business?"
"The show business."
A fatal question. I recognized that I was defeated. If I answered no,he would cut the matter short and wave me to the door without the graceof a word--I saw it in his uncompromising eye; if I said I was alecturer, he would despise me, and dismiss me with opprobrious words; ifI said I was a dramatist, he would throw me out of the window. I sawthat my case was hopeless, so I chose the course which seemed leasthumiliating: I would pocket my shame and glide out without answering.The silence was growing lengthy.
"I'll ask ye again. Are ye in the show business yerself?"
"Yes!"
I said it with splendid confidence; for in that moment the very twin ofthat grand New Haven dog loafed into the room, and I saw that Irishman'seye light eloquently with pride and affection.
"Ye are? And what is it?"
"I've got a bench-show in New Haven."
The weather did change then.
"You don't say, sir! And that's your show, sir! Oh, it's a grand show,it's a wonderful show, sir, and a proud man I am to see your honor thisday. And ye'll be an expert, sir, and ye'll know all about dogs--morethan ever they know theirselves, I'll take me oath to ut."
I said, with modesty:
"I believe I have some reputation that way. In fact, my businessrequires it."
"Ye have some reputation, your honor! Bedad I believe you! There's nota jintleman in the worrld that can lay over ye in the judgmint of a dog,sir. Now I'll vinture that your honor'll know that dog's dimensionsthere better than he knows them his own self, and just by the casting ofyour educated eye upon him. Would you mind giving a guess, if ye'll beso good?"
I knew that upon my answer would depend my fate. If I made this dogbigger than the prize-dog, it would be bad diplomacy, and suspicious; ifI fell too far short of the prizedog, that would be equally damaging.The dog was standing by the table, and I believed I knew the differencebetween him and the one whose picture I had seen in the newspaper to ashade. I spoke promptly up and said:
"It's no trouble to guess this noble creature's figures height, threefeet; length, four feet and three-quarters of an inch; weight, a hundredand forty-eight and a quarter."
The man snatched his hat from its peg and danced on it with joy,shouting:
"Ye've hardly missed it the hair's breadth, hardly the shade of a shade,your honor! Oh, it's the miraculous eye ye've got, for the judgmint of adog!"
And still pouring out his admiration of my capacities, he snatched offhis vest and scoured off one of the wooden chairs with it, and scrubbedit and polished it, and said:
"There, sit down, your honor, I'm ashamed of meself that I forgot ye werestanding all this time; and do put on your hat, ye mustn't take cold,it's a drafty place; and here is your cigar, sir, a getting cold, I'llgive ye a light. There. The place is all yours, sir, and if ye'll justput your feet on the table and make yourself at home, I'll stir aroundand get a candle and light ye up the ould crazy stairs and see that yedon't come to anny harm, for be this time Mr. Daly'll be that impatientto see your honor that he'll be taking the roof off."
He conducted me cautiously and tenderly up the stairs, lighting the wayand protecting me with friendly warnings, then pushed the door open andbowed me in and went his way, mumbling hearty things about my wonderfuleye for points of a dog. Mr. Daly was writing and had his back to me.He glanced over his shoulder presently, then jumped up and said--
"Oh, dear me, I forgot all about giving instructions. I was just writingyou to beg a thousand pardons. But how is it you are here? How did youget by that Irishman? You are the first man that's done it in five andtwenty years. You didn't bribe him, I know that; there's not moneyenough in New York to do it. And you didn't persuade him; he is all iceand iron: there isn't a soft place nor a warm one in him anywhere. Thatis your secret? Look here; you owe me a hundred dollars forunintentionally giving you a chance to perform a miracle--for it is amiracle that you've done."
"That is all right," I said, "collect it of Jimmy Lewis."
That good dog not only did me that good turn in the time of my need, buthe won for me the envious reputation among all the theatrical people fromthe Atlantic to the Pacific of being the only man in history who had everrun the blockade of Augustin Daly's back door.
