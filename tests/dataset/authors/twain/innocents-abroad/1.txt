For months the great pleasure excursion to Europe and the Holy Land waschatted about in the newspapers everywhere in America and discussed atcountless firesides. It was a novelty in the way of excursions--its likehad not been thought of before, and it compelled that interest whichattractive novelties always command. It was to be a picnic on a giganticscale. The participants in it, instead of freighting an ungainly steamferry--boat with youth and beauty and pies and doughnuts, and paddling upsome obscure creek to disembark upon a grassy lawn and wear themselvesout with a long summer day's laborious frolicking under the impressionthat it was fun, were to sail away in a great steamship with flags flyingand cannon pealing, and take a royal holiday beyond the broad ocean inmany a strange clime and in many a land renowned in history! They were tosail for months over the breezy Atlantic and the sunny Mediterranean;they were to scamper about the decks by day, filling the ship with shoutsand laughter--or read novels and poetry in the shade of the smokestacks,or watch for the jelly-fish and the nautilus over the side, and theshark, the whale, and other strange monsters of the deep; and at nightthey were to dance in the open air, on the upper deck, in the midst of aballroom that stretched from horizon to horizon, and was domed by thebending heavens and lighted by no meaner lamps than the stars and themagnificent moon--dance, and promenade, and smoke, and sing, and makelove, and search the skies for constellations that never associate withthe "Big Dipper" they were so tired of; and they were to see the ships oftwenty navies--the customs and costumes of twenty curious peoples--thegreat cities of half a world--they were to hob-nob with nobility and holdfriendly converse with kings and princes, grand moguls, and the anointedlords of mighty empires! It was a brave conception; it was the offspringof a most ingenious brain. It was well advertised, but it hardly neededit: the bold originality, the extraordinary character, the seductivenature, and the vastness of the enterprise provoked comment everywhereand advertised it in every household in the land. Who could read theprogram of the excursion without longing to make one of the party? I willinsert it here. It is almost as good as a map. As a text for this book,nothing could be better: 
                   EXCURSION TO THE HOLY LAND, EGYPT,      THE CRIMEA, GREECE, AND INTERMEDIATE POINTS OF INTEREST.                     BROOKLYN, February 1st, 1867
       The undersigned will make an excursion as above during the coming     season, and begs to submit to you the following programme:
       A first-class steamer, to be under his own command, and capable of     accommodating at least one hundred and fifty cabin passengers, will     be selected, in which will be taken a select company, numbering not     more than   three-fourths of the ship's capacity.  There is good     reason to believe that this company can be easily made up in this     immediate vicinity, of mutual friends and acquaintances.
       The steamer will be provided with every necessary comfort,     including library and musical instruments.
       An experienced physician will be on board.
       Leaving New York about June 1st, a middle and pleasant route will     be taken across the Atlantic, and passing through the group of     Azores, St. Michael will be reached in about ten days.  A day or two     will be spent here, enjoying the fruit and wild scenery of these     islands, and the voyage continued, and Gibraltar reached in three or     four days.
       A day or two will be spent here in looking over the wonderful     subterraneous fortifications, permission to visit these galleries     being readily obtained.
       From Gibraltar, running along the coasts of Spain and France,     Marseilles will be reached in three days.  Here ample time will be     given not only to look over the city, which was founded six hundred     years before the Christian era, and its artificial port, the finest     of the kind in the Mediterranean, but to visit Paris during the     Great Exhibition; and the beautiful city of Lyons, lying     intermediate, from the heights of which, on a clear day, Mont Blanc     and the Alps can be distinctly seen.  Passengers who may wish to     extend the time at Paris can do so, and, passing down through     Switzerland, rejoin the steamer at Genoa.
       From Marseilles to Genoa is a run of one night.  The excursionists     will have an opportunity to look over this, the "magnificent city of     palaces," and visit the birthplace of Columbus, twelve miles off,     over a beautiful road built by Napoleon I.  From this point,     excursions may be made to Milan, Lakes Como and Maggiore, or to     Milan, Verona (famous for its extraordinary fortifications), Padua,     and Venice.  Or, if passengers desire to visit Parma (famous for     Correggio's frescoes) and Bologna, they can by rail go on to     Florence, and rejoin the steamer at Leghorn, thus spending about     three weeks amid the cities most famous for art in Italy.
       From Genoa the run to Leghorn will be made along the coast in one     night, and time appropriated to this point in which to visit     Florence, its palaces and galleries; Pisa, its cathedral and     "Leaning Tower," and Lucca and its baths, and Roman amphitheater;     Florence, the most remote, being distant by rail about sixty miles.
       From Leghorn to Naples (calling at Civita Vecchia to land any who     may prefer to go to Rome from that point), the distance will be made     in about thirty-six hours; the route will lay along the coast of     Italy, close by Caprera, Elba, and Corsica.  Arrangements have been     made to take on board at Leghorn a pilot for Caprera, and, if     practicable, a call will be made there to visit the home of     Garibaldi.
       Rome [by rail], Herculaneum, Pompeii, Vesuvius, Vergil's tomb, and     possibly the ruins of Paestum can be visited, as well as the     beautiful surroundings of Naples and its charming bay.
       The next point of interest will be Palermo, the most beautiful     city of Sicily, which will be reached in one night from Naples.  A     day will be spent here, and leaving in the evening, the course will     be taken towards Athens.
       Skirting along the north coast of Sicily, passing through the     group of Aeolian Isles, in sight of Stromboli and Vulcania, both     active volcanoes, through the Straits of Messina, with "Scylla" on     the one hand and "Charybdis" on the other, along the east coast of     Sicily, and in sight of Mount Etna, along the south coast of Italy,     the west and south coast of Greece, in sight of ancient Crete, up     Athens Gulf, and into the Piraeus, Athens will be reached in two and     a half or three days.  After tarrying here awhile, the Bay of     Salamis will be crossed, and a day given to Corinth, whence the     voyage will be continued to Constantinople, passing on the way     through the Grecian Archipelago, the Dardanelles, the Sea of     Marmora, and the mouth of the Golden Horn, and arriving in about     forty-eight hours from Athens.
       After leaving Constantinople, the way will be taken out through     the beautiful Bosphorus, across the Black Sea to Sebastopol and     Balaklava, a run of about twenty-four hours.  Here it is proposed to     remain two days, visiting the harbors, fortifications, and     battlefields of the Crimea; thence back through the Bosphorus,     touching at Constantinople to take in any who may have preferred to     remain there; down through the Sea of Marmora and the Dardanelles,     along the coasts of ancient Troy and Lydia in Asia, to Smyrna, which     will be reached in two or two and a half days from Constantinople.     A sufficient stay will be made here to give opportunity of visiting     Ephesus, fifty miles distant by rail.
       From Smyrna towards the Holy Land the course will lay through the     Grecian  Archipelago, close by the Isle of Patmos, along the coast     of Asia, ancient Pamphylia, and the Isle of Cyprus.  Beirut will be     reached in three days.  At Beirut time will be given to visit     Damascus; after which the steamer will proceed to Joppa.
       From Joppa, Jerusalem, the River Jordan, the Sea of Tiberias,     Nazareth, Bethany, Bethlehem, and other points of interest in the     Holy Land can be visited, and here those who may have preferred to     make the journey from Beirut through the country, passing through     Damascus, Galilee, Capernaum, Samaria, and by the River Jordan and     Sea of Tiberias, can rejoin the steamer.
       Leaving Joppa, the next point of interest to visit will be     Alexandria, which will be reached in twenty-four hours.  The ruins     of Caesar's Palace, Pompey's Pillar, Cleopatra's Needle, the     Catacombs, and ruins of ancient Alexandria will be found worth the     visit.  The journey to Cairo, one hundred and thirty miles by rail,     can be made in a few hours, and from which can be visited the site     of ancient Memphis, Joseph's Granaries, and the Pyramids.
       From Alexandria the route will be taken homeward, calling at     Malta, Cagliari (in Sardinia), and Palma (in Majorca), all     magnificent harbors, with charming scenery, and abounding in fruits.
       A day or two will be spent at each place, and leaving Parma in the     evening, Valencia in Spain will be reached the next morning.  A few     days will be spent in this, the finest city of Spain.
       From Valencia, the homeward course will be continued, skirting     along the coast of Spain.  Alicant, Carthagena, Palos, and Malaga     will be passed but a mile or two distant, and Gibraltar reached in     about twenty-four hours.
       A stay of one day will be made here, and the voyage continued to     Madeira, which will be reached in about three days.  Captain     Marryatt writes: "I do not know a spot on the globe which so much     astonishes and delights upon first arrival as Madeira." A stay of     one or two days will be made here, which, if time permits, may be     extended, and passing on through the islands, and probably in sight     of the Peak of Teneriffe, a southern track will be taken, and the     Atlantic crossed within the latitudes of the northeast trade winds,     where mild and pleasant weather, and a smooth sea, can always be     expected.
       A call will be made at Bermuda, which lies directly in this route     homeward, and will be reached in about ten days from Madeira, and     after spending a short time with our friends the Bermudians, the     final departure will be made for home, which will be reached in     about three days.
       Already, applications have been received from parties in Europe     wishing to join the Excursion there.
       The ship will at all times be a home, where the excursionists, if     sick, will be surrounded by kind friends, and have all possible     comfort and sympathy.
       Should contagious sickness exist in any of the ports named in the     program, such ports will be passed, and others of interest     substituted.
       The price of passage is fixed at $1,250, currency, for each adult     passenger.  Choice of rooms and of seats at the tables apportioned     in the order in which passages are engaged; and no passage     considered engaged until ten percent of the passage money is     deposited with the treasurer.
       Passengers can remain on board of the steamer, at all ports, if     they desire, without additional expense, and all boating at the     expense of the ship.
       All passages must be paid for when taken, in order that the most     perfect arrangements be made for starting at the appointed time.
       Applications for passage must be approved by the committee before     tickets are issued, and can be made to the undersigned.
       Articles of interest or curiosity, procured by the passengers     during the voyage, may be brought home in the steamer free of     charge.
       Five dollars per day, in gold, it is believed, will be a fair     calculation to make for all traveling expenses onshore and at the     various points where passengers may wish to leave the steamer for     days at a time.
       The trip can be extended, and the route changed, by unanimous vote     of the passengers.

       P.S.--The very beautiful and substantial side-wheel steamship     "Quaker City" has been chartered for the occasion, and will leave     New York June 8th.  Letters have been issued by the government     commending the party to courtesies abroad.

What was there lacking about that program to make it perfectlyirresistible? Nothing that any finite mind could discover. Paris,England, Scotland, Switzerland, Italy--Garibaldi! The GrecianArchipelago! Vesuvius! Constantinople! Smyrna! The Holy Land! Egypt and"our friends the Bermudians"! People in Europe desiring to join theexcursion--contagious sickness to be avoided--boating at the expense ofthe ship--physician on board--the circuit of the globe to be made if thepassengers unanimously desired it--the company to be rigidly selected bya pitiless "Committee on Applications"--the vessel to be as rigidlyselected by as pitiless a "Committee on Selecting Steamer." Human naturecould not withstand these bewildering temptations. I hurried to thetreasurer's office and deposited my ten percent. I rejoiced to know thata few vacant staterooms were still left. I did avoid a critical personalexamination into my character by that bowelless committee, but I referredto all the people of high standing I could think of in the community whowould be least likely to know anything about me.
Shortly a supplementary program was issued which set forth that thePlymouth Collection of Hymns would be used on board the ship. I thenpaid the balance of my passage money.
I was provided with a receipt and duly and officially accepted as anexcursionist. There was happiness in that but it was tame compared tothe novelty of being "select."
This supplementary program also instructed the excursionists to providethemselves with light musical instruments for amusement in the ship, withsaddles for Syrian travel, green spectacles and umbrellas, veils forEgypt, and substantial clothing to use in rough pilgrimizing in the HolyLand. Furthermore, it was suggested that although the ship's librarywould afford a fair amount of reading matter, it would still be well ifeach passenger would provide himself with a few guidebooks, a Bible, andsome standard works of travel. A list was appended, which consistedchiefly of books relating to the Holy Land, since the Holy Land was partof the excursion and seemed to be its main feature.
Reverend Henry Ward Beecher was to have accompanied the expedition, buturgent duties obliged him to give up the idea. There were otherpassengers who could have been spared better and would have been sparedmore willingly. Lieutenant General Sherman was to have been of the partyalso, but the Indian war compelled his presence on the plains. A popularactress had entered her name on the ship's books, but somethinginterfered and she couldn't go. The "Drummer Boy of the Potomac"deserted, and lo, we had never a celebrity left!
However, we were to have a "battery of guns" from the Navy Department (asper advertisement) to be used in answering royal salutes; and thedocument furnished by the Secretary of the Navy, which was to make"General Sherman and party" welcome guests in the courts and camps of theold world, was still left to us, though both document and battery, Ithink, were shorn of somewhat of their original august proportions.However, had not we the seductive program still, with its Paris, itsConstantinople, Smyrna, Jerusalem, Jericho, and "our friends theBermudians?" What did we care?
