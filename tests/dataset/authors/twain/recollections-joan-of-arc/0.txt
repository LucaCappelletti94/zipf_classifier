TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE
To arrive at a just estimate of a renowned man's character one mustjudge it by the standards of his time, not ours. Judged by the standardsof one century, the noblest characters of an earlier one lose much oftheir luster; judged by the standards of to-day, there is probably noillustrious man of four or five centuries ago whose character could meetthe test at all points. But the character of Joan of Arc is unique. Itcan be measured by the standards of all times without misgiving orapprehension as to the result. Judged by any of them, it is stillflawless, it is still ideally perfect; it still occupies the loftiestplace possible to human attainment, a loftier one than has been reachedby any other mere mortal.
When we reflect that her century was the brutalest, the wickedest, therottenest in history since the darkest ages, we are lost in wonder atthe miracle of such a product from such a soil. The contrast between herand her century is the contrast between day and night. She was truthfulwhen lying was the common speech of men; she was honest when honesty wasbecome a lost virtue; she was a keeper of promises when the keeping of apromise was expected of no one; she gave her great mind to greatthoughts and great purposes when other great minds wasted themselvesupon pretty fancies or upon poor ambitions; she was modest, and fine,and delicate when to be loud and coarse might be said to be universal;she was full of pity when a merciless cruelty was the rule; she wassteadfast when stability was unknown, and honorable in an age which hadforgotten what honor was; she was a rock of convictions in a time whenmen believed in nothing and scoffed at all things; she was unfailinglytrue to an age that was false to the core; she maintained her personaldignity unimpaired in an age of fawnings and servilities; she was of adauntless courage when hope and courage had perished in the hearts ofher nation; she was spotlessly pure in mind and body when society in thehighest places was foul in both--she was all these things in an age whencrime was the common business of lords and princes, and when the highestpersonages in Christendom were able to astonish even that infamous eraand make it stand aghast at the spectacle of their atrocious lives blackwith unimaginable treacheries, butcheries, and beastialities.
She was perhaps the only entirely unselfish person whose name has aplace in profane history. No vestige or suggestion of self-seeking canbe found in any word or deed of hers. When she had rescued her King fromhis vagabondage, and set his crown upon his head, she was offeredrewards and honors, but she refused them all, and would take nothing.All she would take for herself--if the King would grant it--was leave togo back to her village home, and tend her sheep again, and feel hermother's arms about her, and be her housemaid and helper. Theselfishness of this unspoiled general of victorious armies, companion ofprinces, and idol of an applauding and grateful nation, reached but thatfar and no farther.
The work wrought by Joan of Arc may fairly be regarded as ranking anyrecorded in history, when one considers the conditions under which itwas undertaken, the obstacles in the way, and the means at her disposal.Caesar carried conquests far, but he did it with the trained andconfident veterans of Rome, and was a trained soldier himself; andNapoleon swept away the disciplined armies of Europe, but he also was atrained soldier, and the began his work with patriot battalions inflamedand inspired by the miracle-working new breath of Liberty breathed uponthem by the Revolution--eager young apprentices to the splendid trade ofwar, not old and broken men-at-arms, despairing survivors of an age-longaccumulation of monotonous defeats; but Joan of Arc, a mere child inyears, ignorant, unlettered, a poor village girl unknown and withoutinfluence, found a great nation lying in chains, helpless and hopelessunder an alien domination, its treasury bankrupt, its soldiersdisheartened and dispersed, all spirit torpid, all courage dead in thehearts of the people through long years of foreign and domestic outrageand oppression, their King cowed, resigned to its fate, and preparing tofly the country; and she laid her hand upon this nation, this corpse,and it rose and followed her. She led it from victory to victory, sheturned back the tide of the Hundred Years' War, she fatally crippled theEnglish power, and died with the earned title of DELIVERER OF FRANCE,which she bears to this day.
And for all reward, the French King, whom she had crowned, stood supineand indifferent, while French priests took the noble child, the mostinnocent, the most lovely, the most adorable the ages have produced, andburned her alive at the stake.
A PECULIARITY OF JOAN OF ARC'S HISTORY
The details of the life of Joan of Arc form a biography which is uniqueamong the world's biographies in one respect: It is the only story of ahuman life which comes to us under oath, the only one which comes to usfrom the witness-stand. The official records of the Great Trial of 1431,and of the Process of Rehabilitation of a quarter of a century later,are still preserved in the National Archives of France, and they furnishwith remarkable fullness the facts of her life. The history of no otherlife of that remote time is known with either the certainty or thecomprehensiveness that attaches to hers.
The Sieur Louis de Conte is faithful to her official history in hisPersonal Recollections, and thus far his trustworthiness isunimpeachable; but his mass of added particulars must depend for creditupon his word alone.

THE SIEUR LOUIS DE CONTE
To his Great-Great-Grand Nephews and Nieces
This is the year 1492. I am eighty-two years of age. The things I amgoing to tell you are things which I saw myself as a child and as ayouth.
In all the tales and songs and histories of Joan of Arc, which you andthe rest of the world read and sing and study in the books wrought inthe late invented art of printing, mention is made of me, the SieurLouis de Conte--I was her page and secretary, I was with her from thebeginning until the end.
I was reared in the same village with her. I played with her every day,when we were little children together, just as you play with your mates.Now that we perceive how great she was, now that her name fills thewhole world, it seems strange that what I am saying is true; for it isas if a perishable paltry candle should speak of the eternal sun ridingin the heavens and say, "He was gossip and housemate to me when we werecandles together." And yet it is true, just as I say. I was herplaymate, and I fought at her side in the wars; to this day I carry inmy mind, fine and clear, the picture of that dear little figure, withbreast bent to the flying horse's neck, charging at the head of thearmies of France, her hair streaming back, her silver mail plowingsteadily deeper and deeper into the thick of the battle, sometimesnearly drowned from sight by tossing heads of horses, upliftedsword-arms, wind-blow plumes, and intercepting shields. I was with herto the end; and when that black day came whose accusing shadow will liealways upon the memory of the mitered French slaves of England who wereher assassins, and upon France who stood idle and essayed no rescue, myhand was the last she touched in life.
As the years and the decades drifted by, and the spectacle of themarvelous child's meteor flight across the war firmament of France andits extinction in the smoke-clouds of the stake receded deeper anddeeper into the past and grew ever more strange, and wonderful, anddivine, and pathetic, I came to comprehend and recognize her at last forwhat she was--the most noble life that was ever born into this worldsave only One.
