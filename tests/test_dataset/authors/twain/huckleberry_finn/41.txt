"Who is your folks?" he says.
"The Phelpses, down yonder."
"Oh," he says. And after a minute, he says:
"How'd you say he got shot?"
"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."
"Singular dream," he says.
So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, andwe started. But when he sees the canoe he didn't likethe look of her -- said she was big enough for one, butdidn't look pretty safe for two. I says:
"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried thethree of us easy enough."
"What three?"
"Why, me and Sid, and -- and -- and THE GUNS;that's what I mean."
"Oh," he says.
But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her,and shook his head, and said he reckoned he'd lookaround for a bigger one. But they was all locked andchained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to waittill he come back, or I could hunt around further, ormaybe I better go down home and get them ready forthe surprise if I wanted to. But I said I didn't; soI told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.
I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself,spos'n he can't fix that leg just in three shakes of asheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n it takes him threeor four days? What are we going to do? -- lay aroundthere till he lets the cat out of the bag? No, sir; Iknow what I'LL do. I'll wait, and when he comes backif he says he's got to go any more I'll get down there,too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him, and keephim, and shove out down the river; and when Tom'sdone with him we'll give him what it's worth, or allwe got, and then let him get ashore.
So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep;and next time I waked up the sun was away up overmy head! I shot out and went for the doctor'shouse, but they told me he'd gone away in the nightsome time or other, and warn't back yet. Well, thinksI, that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I'll dig outfor the island right off. So away I shoved, and turnedthe corner, and nearly rammed my head into UncleSilas's stomach! He says:
"Why, TOM! Where you been all this time, yourascal?"
"I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunt-ing for the runaway nigger -- me and Sid."
"Why, where ever did you go?" he says. "Youraunt's been mighty uneasy."
"She needn't," I says, "because we was all right.We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us,and we lost them; but we thought we heard them onthe water, so we got a canoe and took out after themand crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them;so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tiredand beat out; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep,and never waked up till about an hour ago; then wepaddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at thepost-office to see what he can hear, and I'm a-branch-ing out to get something to eat for us, and then we'regoing home."
So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; butjust as I suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old manhe got a letter out of the office, and we waited awhilelonger, but Sid didn't come; so the old man said,come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when hegot done fooling around -- but we would ride. Icouldn't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid; andhe said there warn't no use in it, and I must comealong, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.
When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to seeme she laughed and cried both, and hugged me, andgive me one of them lickings of hern that don't amountto shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when hecome.
And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers'wives, to dinner; and such another clack a body neverheard. Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst; her tonguewas a-going all the time. She says:
"Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabinover, an' I b'lieve the nigger was crazy. I says toSister Damrell -- didn't I, Sister Damrell? -- s'I, he'scrazy, s'I -- them's the very words I said. You allhearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.Look at that-air grindstone, s'I; want to tell ME't anycretur 't's in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble allthem crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I? Here sich 'n'sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' sopegged along for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that --natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n' sich everlast'nrubbage. He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says inthe fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it'swhat I says last 'n' all the time -- the nigger's crazy --crazy 's Nebokoodneezer, s'I."
"An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, SisterHotchkiss," says old Mrs. Damrell; "what in thename o' goodness COULD he ever want of --"
"The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'nthis minute to Sister Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you soherself. Sh-she, look at that-air rag ladder, sh-she;'n' s'I, yes, LOOK at it, s'I -- what COULD he a-wantedof it, s'I. Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she --"
"But how in the nation'd they ever GIT that grind-stone IN there, ANYWAY? 'n' who dug that-air HOLE? 'n'who --"
"My very WORDS, Brer Penrod! I was a-sayin' --pass that-air sasser o' m'lasses, won't ye? -- I wasa-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute, how DID theygit that grindstone in there, s'I. Without HELP, mindyou -- 'thout HELP! THAT'S wher 'tis. Don't tell ME,s'I; there WUZ help, s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a PLENTY help,too, s'I; ther's ben a DOZEN a-helpin' that nigger, 'n' Ilay I'd skin every last nigger on this place but I'D findout who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I --"
"A DOZEN says you! -- FORTY couldn't a done everything that's been done. Look at them case-knife sawsand things, how tedious they've been made; look atthat bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for sixmen; look at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed;and look at --"
"You may WELL say it, Brer Hightower! It's jist asI was a-sayin' to Brer Phelps, his own self. S'e, whatdo YOU think of it, Sister Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o'what, Brer Phelps, s'I? Think o' that bed-leg sawedoff that a way, s'e? THINK of it, s'I? I lay it neversawed ITSELF off, s'I -- somebody SAWED it, s'I; that'smy opinion, take it or leave it, it mayn't be no 'count,s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my opinion, s'I, 'n' if anybody k'n start a better one, s'I, let him DO it, s'I,that's all. I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I --"
"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o'niggers in there every night for four weeks to a doneall that work, Sister Phelps. Look at that shirt --every last inch of it kivered over with secret Africanwrit'n done with blood! Must a ben a raft uv 'm at itright along, all the time, amost. Why, I'd give twodollars to have it read to me; 'n' as for the niggersthat wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll --"
"People to HELP him, Brother Marples! Well, Ireckon you'd THINK so if you'd a been in this house fora while back. Why, they've stole everything theycould lay their hands on -- and we a-watching all thetime, mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' theline! and as for that sheet they made the rag ladder outof, ther' ain't no telling how many times they DIDN'Tsteal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks,and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most athousand things that I disremember now, and my newcalico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and Tomon the constant watch day AND night, as I was a-tellingyou, and not a one of us could catch hide nor hair norsight nor sound of them; and here at the last minute,lo and behold you, they slides right in under our nosesand fools us, and not only fools US but the Injun Terri-tory robbers too, and actuly gets AWAY with that niggersafe and sound, and that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at that very time!I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever HEARD of.Why, SPERITS couldn't a done better and been nosmarter. And I reckon they must a BEEN sperits -- be-cause, YOU know our dogs, and ther' ain't no better;well, them dogs never even got on the TRACK of 'monce! You explain THAT to me if you can! -- ANY ofyou!"
"Well, it does beat --"
"Laws alive, I never --"
"So help me, I wouldn't a be --"
"HOUSE-thieves as well as --"
"Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live insich a --"
"'Fraid to LIVE! -- why, I was that scared I dasn'thardly go to bed, or get up, or lay down, or SET down,Sister Ridgeway. Why, they'd steal the very -- why,goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster Iwas in by the time midnight come last night. I hopeto gracious if I warn't afraid they'd steal some o' thefamily! I was just to that pass I didn't have no reason-ing faculties no more. It looks foolish enough NOW, inthe daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poorboys asleep, 'way up stairs in that lonesome room, andI declare to goodness I was that uneasy 't I crep' upthere and locked 'em in! I DID. And anybody would.Because, you know, when you get scared that way,and it keeps running on, and getting worse and worseall the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you getto doing all sorts o' wild things, and by and by youthink to yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away upthere, and the door ain't locked, and you --" Shestopped, looking kind of wondering, and then sheturned her head around slow, and when her eye lit onme -- I got up and took a walk.
Says I to myself, I can explain better how we cometo not be in that room this morning if I go out to oneside and study over it a little. So I done it. But Idasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me. And when itwas late in the day the people all went, and then Icome in and told her the noise and shooting waked upme and "Sid," and the door was locked, and wewanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn't neverwant to try THAT no more. And then I went on andtold her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and thenshe said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all rightenough anyway, and about what a body might expectof boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot asfur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn'tcome of it, she judged she better put in her time beinggrateful we was alive and well and she had us still, steadof fretting over what was past and done. So then shekissed me, and patted me on the head, and droppedinto a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumpsup, and says:
"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid notcome yet! What HAS become of that boy?"
I see my chance; so I skips up and says:
"I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.
"No you won't," she says. "You'll stay rightwher' you are; ONE'S enough to be lost at a time. Ifhe ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll go."
Well, he warn't there to supper; so right aftersupper uncle went.
He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn'trun across Tom's track. Aunt Sally was a good DEALuneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there warn't no occa-sion to be -- boys will be boys, he said, and you'll seethis one turn up in the morning all sound and right.So she had to be satisfied. But she said she'd set upfor him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so hecould see it.
And then when I went up to bed she come up withme and fetched her candle, and tucked me in, andmothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn'tlook her in the face; and she set down on the bed andtalked with me a long time, and said what a splendidboy Sid was, and didn't seem to want to ever stoptalking about him; and kept asking me every now andthen if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, ormaybe drownded, and might be laying at this minutesomewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him tohelp him, and so the tears would drip down silent, andI would tell her that Sid was all right, and would behome in the morning, sure; and she would squeeze myhand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again,and keep on saying it, because it done her good, andshe was in so much trouble. And when she was goingaway she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle,and says:
"The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, andthere's the window and the rod; but you'll be good,WON'T you? And you won't go? For MY sake."
Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see aboutTom, and was all intending to go; but after that Iwouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.
But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind,so I slept very restless. And twice I went down therod away in the night, and slipped around front, andsee her setting there by her candle in the window withher eyes towards the road and the tears in them; andI wished I could do something for her, but I couldn't,only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing togrieve her any more. And the third time I waked upat dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, andher candle was most out, and her old gray head wasresting on her hand, and she was asleep.
