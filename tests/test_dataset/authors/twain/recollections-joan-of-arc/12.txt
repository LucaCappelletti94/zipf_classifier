Joan Leads Us Through the Enemy
WE WERE called to quarters and subjected to a searching inspection byJoan. Then she made a short little talk in which she said that even therude business of war could be conducted better without profanity andother brutalities of speech than with them, and that she should strictlyrequire us to remember and apply this admonition. She ordered half anhour's horsemanship drill for the novices then, and appointed one of theveterans to conduct it. It was a ridiculous exhibition, but we learnedsomething, and Joan was satisfied and complimented us. She did not takeany instruction herself or go through the evolutions and manoeuvres, butmerely sat her horse like a martial little statue and looked on. That wassufficient for her, you see. She would not miss or forget a detail of thelesson, she would take it all in with her eye and her mind, and apply itafterward with as much certainty and confidence as if she had alreadypractised it.
We now made three night marches of twelve or thirteen leagues each,riding in peace and undisturbed, being taken for a roving band of FreeCompanions. Country-folk were glad to have that sort of people go bywithout stopping. Still, they were very wearying marches, and notcomfortable, for the bridges were few and the streams many, and as we hadto ford them we found the water dismally cold, and afterward had to bedourselves, still wet, on the frosty or snowy ground, and get warm as wemight and sleep if we could, for it would not have been prudent to buildfires. Our energies languished under these hardships and deadly fatigues,but Joan's did not. Her step kept its spring and firmness and her eye itsfire. We could only wonder at this, we could not explain it.
But if we had had hard times before, I know not what to call the fivenights that now followed, for the marches were as fatiguing, the baths ascold, and we were ambuscaded seven times in addition, and lost twonovices and three veterans in the resulting fights. The news had leakedout and gone abroad that the inspired Virgin of Vaucouleurs was makingfor the King with an escort, and all the roads were being watched now.
These five nights disheartened the command a good deal. This wasaggravated by a discovery which Noel made, and which he promptly madeknown at headquarters. Some of the men had been trying to understand whyJoan continued to be alert, vigorous, and confident while the strongestmen in the company were fagged with the heavy marches and exposure andwere become morose and irritable. There, it shows you how men can haveeyes and yet not see. All their lives those men had seen their ownwomen-folks hitched up with a cow and dragging the plow in the fieldswhile the men did the driving. They had also seen other evidences thatwomen have far more endurance and patience and fortitude than men--butwhat good had their seeing these things been to them? None. It had taughtthem nothing. They were still surprised to see a girl of seventeen bearthe fatigues of war better than trained veterans of the army. Moreover,they did not reflect that a great soul, with a great purpose, can make aweak body strong and keep it so; and here was the greatest soul in theuniverse; but how could they know that, those dumb creatures? No, theyknew nothing, and their reasonings were of a piece with their ignorance.They argued and discussed among themselves, with Noel listening, andarrived at the decision that Joan was a witch, and had her strange pluckand strength from Satan; so they made a plan to watch for a safeopportunity to take her life.
To have secret plottings of this sort going on in our midst was a veryserious business, of course, and the knights asked Joan's permission tohang the plotters, but she refused without hesitancy. She said:
"Neither these men nor any others can take my life before my mission isaccomplished, therefore why should I have their blood upon my hands? Iwill inform them of this, and also admonish them. Call them before me."
When the came she made that statement to them in a plain matter-of-factway, and just as if the thought never entered her mind that any one coulddoubt it after she had given her word that it was true. The men wereevidently amazed and impressed to hear her say such a thing in such asure and confident way, for prophecies boldly uttered never fall barrenon superstitious ears. Yes, this speech certainly impressed them, but herclosing remark impressed them still more. It was for the ringleader, andJoan said it sorrowfully:
"It is a pity that you should plot another's death when you own is soclose at hand."
That man's horse stumbled and fell on him in the first ford which wecrossed that night, and he was drowned before we could help him. We hadno more conspiracies.
This night was harassed with ambuscades, but we got through withouthaving any men killed. One more night would carry us over the hostilefrontier if we had good luck, and we saw the night close down with a gooddeal of solicitude. Always before, we had been more or less reluctant tostart out into the gloom and the silence to be frozen in the fords andpersecuted by the enemy, but this time we were impatient to get under wayand have it over, although there was promise of more and harder fightingthan any of the previous nights had furnished. Moreover, in front of usabout three leagues there was a deep stream with a frail wooden bridgeover it, and as a cold rain mixed with snow had been falling steadily allday we were anxious to find out whether we were in a trap or not. If theswollen stream had washed away the bridge, we might properly considerourselves trapped and cut off from escape.
As soon as it was dark we filed out from the depth of the forest where wehad been hidden and began the march. From the time that we had begun toencounter ambushes Joan had ridden at the head of the column, and shetook this post now. By the time we had gone a league the rain and snowhad turned to sleet, and under the impulse of the storm-wind it lashed myface like whips, and I envied Joan and the knights, who could close theirvisors and shut up their heads in their helmets as in a box. Now, out ofthe pitchy darkness and close at hand, came the sharp command:
"Halt!"
We obeyed. I made out a dim mass in front of us which might be a body ofhorsemen, but one could not be sure. A man rode up and said to Joan in atone of reproof:
"Well, you have taken your time, truly. And what have you found out? Isshe still behind us, or in front?"
Joan answered in a level voice:
"She is still behind."
This news softened the stranger's tone. He said:
"If you know that to be true, you have not lost your time, Captain. Butare you sure? How do you know?"
"Because I have seen her."
"Seen her! Seen the Virgin herself?"
"Yes, I have been in her camp."
"Is it possible! Captain Raymond, I ask you to pardon me for speaking inthat tone just now. You have performed a daring and admirable service.Where was she camped?"
"In the forest, not more than a league from here."
"Good! I was afraid we might be still behind her, but now that we knowshe is behind us, everything is safe. She is our game. We will hang her.You shall hang her yourself. No one has so well earned the privilege ofabolishing this pestilent limb of Satan."
"I do not know how to thank you sufficiently. If we catch her, I--"
"If! I will take care of that; give yourself no uneasiness. All I want isjust a look at her, to see what the imp is like that has been able tomake all this noise, then you and the halter may have her. How many menhas she?"
"I counted but eighteen, but she may have had two or three pickets out."
"Is that all? It won't be a mouthful for my force. Is it true that she isonly a girl?"
"Yes; she is not more than seventeen."
"It passes belief! Is she robust, or slender?"
"Slender."
The officer pondered a moment or two, then he said:
"Was she preparing to break camp?"
"Not when I had my last glimpse of her."
"What was she doing?"
"She was talking quietly with an officer."
"Quietly? Not giving orders?"
"No, talking as quietly as we are now."
"That is good. She is feeling a false security. She would have beenrestless and fussy else--it is the way of her sex when danger is about.As she was making no preparation to break camp--"
"She certainly was not when I saw her last."
"--and was chatting quietly and at her ease, it means that this weatheris not to her taste. Night-marching in sleet and wind is not for chits ofseventeen. No; she will stay where she is. She has my thanks. We willcamp, ourselves; here is as good a place as any. Let us get about it."
"If you command it--certainly. But she has two knights with her. Theymight force her to march, particularly if the weather should improve."
I was scared, and impatient to be getting out of this peril, and itdistressed and worried me to have Joan apparently set herself to work tomake delay and increase the danger--still, I thought she probably knewbetter than I what to do. The officer said:
"Well, in that case we are here to block the way."
"Yes, if they come this way. But if they should send out spies, and findout enough to make them want to try for the bridge through the woods? Isit best to allow the bridge to stand?"
It made me shiver to hear her.
The officer considered awhile, then said:
"It might be well enough to send a force to destroy the bridge. I wasintending to occupy it with the whole command, but that is not necessarynow."
Joan said, tranquilly:
"With your permission, I will go and destroy it myself."
Ah, now I saw her idea, and was glad she had had the cleverness to inventit and the ability to keep her head cool and think of it in that tightplace. The officer replied:
"You have it, Captain, and my thanks. With you to do it, it will be welldone; I could send another in your place, but not a better."
They saluted, and we moved forward. I breathed freer. A dozen times I hadimagined I heard the hoofbeats of the real Captain Raymond's trooparriving behind us, and had been sitting on pins and needles all thewhile that that conversation was dragging along. I breathed freer, butwas still not comfortable, for Joan had given only the simple command,"Forward!" Consequently we moved in a walk. Moved in a dead walk past adim and lengthening column of enemies at our side. The suspense wasexhausting, yet it lasted but a short while, for when the enemy's buglessang the "Dismount!" Joan gave the word to trot, and that was a greatrelief to me. She was always at herself, you see. Before the command todismount had been given, somebody might have wanted the countersignsomewhere along that line if we came flying by at speed, but now weeseemed to be on our way to our allotted camping position, so we wereallowed to pass unchallenged. The further we went the more formidable wasthe strength revealed by the hostile force. Perhaps it was only a hundredor two, but to me it seemed a thousand. When we passed the last of thesepeople I was thankful, and the deeper we plowed into the darkness beyondthem the better I felt. I came nearer and nearer to feeling good, for anhour; then we found the bridge still standing, and I felt entirely good.We crossed it and destroyed it, and then I felt--but I cannot describewhat I felt. One has to feel it himself in order to know what it is like.
We had expected to hear the rush of a pursuing force behind us, for wethought that the real Captain Raymond would arrive and suggest thatperhaps the troop that had been mistaken for his belonged to the Virginof Vaucouleurs; but he must have been delayed seriously, for when weresumed our march beyond the river there were no sounds behind us exceptthose which the storm was furnishing.
I said that Joan had harvested a good many compliments intended forCaptain Raymond, and that he would find nothing of a crop left but a drystubble of reprimands when he got back, and a commander just in the humorto superintend the gathering of it in.
Joan said:
"It will be as you say, no doubt; for the commander took a troop forgranted, in the night and unchallenged, and would have camped withoutsending a force to destroy the bridge if he had been left unadvised, andnone are so ready to find fault with others as those who do things worthyof blame themselves."
The Sieur Bertrand was amused at Joan's naive way of referring to heradvice as if it had been a valuable present to a hostile leader who wassaved by it from making a censurable blunder of omission, and then hewent on to admire how ingeniously she had deceived that man and yet hadnot told him anything that was not the truth. This troubled Joan, and shesaid:
"I thought he was deceiving himself. I forbore to tell him lies, for thatwould have been wrong; but if my truths deceived him, perhaps that madethem lies, and I am to blame. I would God I knew if I have done wrong."
She was assured that she had done right, and that in the perils andnecessities of war deceptions that help one's own cause and hurt theenemy's were always permissible; but she was not quite satisfied withthat, and thought that even when a great cause was in danger one ought tohave the privilege of trying honorable ways first. Jean said:
"Joan, you told us yourself that you were going to Uncle Laxart's tonurse his wife, but you didn't say you were going further, yet you did goon to Vaucouleurs. There!"
"I see now," said Joan, sorrowfully. "I told no lie, yet I deceived. Ihad tried all other ways first, but I could not get away, and I had toget away. My mission required it. I did wrong, I think, and am to blame."
She was silent a moment, turning the matter over in her mind, then sheadded, with quiet decision, "But the thing itself was right, and I woulddo it again."
It seemed an over-nice distinction, but nobody said anything. I few hadknown her as well as she knew herself, and as her later history revealedher to us, we should have perceived that she had a clear meaning there,and that her position was not identical with ours, as we were supposing,but occupied a higher plane. She would sacrifice herself--and her bestself; that is, her truthfulness--to save her cause; but only that; shewould not buy her life at that cost; whereas our war-ethics permitted thepurchase of our lives, or any mere military advantage, small or great, bydeception. Her saying seemed a commonplace at the time, the essence ofits meaning escaping us; but one sees now that it contained a principlewhich lifted it above that and made it great and fine.
Presently the wind died down, the sleet stopped falling, and the cold wasless severe. The road was become a bog, and the horses labored through itat a walk--they could do no better. As the heavy time wore on, exhaustionovercame us, and we slept in our saddles. Not even the dangers thatthreatened us could keep us awake.
This tenth night seemed longer than any of the others, and of course itwas the hardest, because we had been accumulating fatigue from thebeginning, and had more of it on hand now than at any previous time. Butwe were not molested again. When the dull dawn came at last we saw ariver before us and we knew it was the Loire; we entered the town ofGien, and knew we were in a friendly land, with the hostiles all behindus. That was a glad morning for us.
We were a worn and bedraggled and shabby-looking troop; and still, asalways, Joan was the freshest of us all, in both body and spirits. We hadaveraged above thirteen leagues a night, by tortuous and wretched roads.It was a remarkable march, and shows what men can do when they have aleader with a determined purpose and a resolution that never flags.
