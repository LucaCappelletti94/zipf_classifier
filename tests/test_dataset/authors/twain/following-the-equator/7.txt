Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
From Diary:--For a day or two we have been plowing among an invisiblevast wilderness of islands, catching now and then a shadowy glimpse of amember of it. There does seem to be a prodigious lot of islands thisyear; the map of this region is freckled and fly-specked all over withthem. Their number would seem to be uncountable. We are moving amongthe Fijis now--224 islands and islets in the group. In front of us, tothe west, the wilderness stretches toward Australia, then curves upwardto New Guinea, and still up and up to Japan; behind us, to the east, thewilderness stretches sixty degrees across the wastes of the Pacific;south of us is New Zealand. Somewhere or other among these myriads Samoais concealed, and not discoverable on the map. Still, if you wish to gothere, you will have no trouble about finding it if you follow thedirections given by Robert Louis Stevenson to Dr. Conan Doyle and to Mr.J. M. Barrie. "You go to America, cross the continent to San Francisco,and then it's the second turning to the left." To get the full flavor ofthe joke one must take a glance at the map.
Wednesday, September 11.--Yesterday we passed close to an island or so,and recognized the published Fiji characteristics: a broad belt of cleanwhite coral sand around the island; back of it a graceful fringe ofleaning palms, with native huts nestling cosily among the shrubbery attheir bases; back of these a stretch of level land clothed in tropicvegetation; back of that, rugged and picturesque mountains. A detailof the immediate foreground: a mouldering ship perched high up on areef-bench. This completes the composition, and makes the pictureartistically perfect.
In the afternoon we sighted Suva, the capital of the group, and threadedour way into the secluded little harbor--a placid basin of brilliant blueand green water tucked snugly in among the sheltering hills. A few shipsrode at anchor in it--one of them a sailing vessel flying the Americanflag; and they said she came from Duluth! There's a journey! Duluth isseveral thousand miles from the sea, and yet she is entitled to the proudname of Mistress of the Commercial Marine of the United States ofAmerica. There is only one free, independent, unsubsidized American shipsailing the foreign seas, and Duluth owns it. All by itself that ship isthe American fleet. All by itself it causes the American name and powerto be respected in the far regions of the globe. All by itself itcertifies to the world that the most populous civilized nation, in theearth has a just pride in her stupendous stretch of sea-front, and isdetermined to assert and maintain her rightful place as one of the GreatMaritime Powers of the Planet. All by itself it is making foreign eyesfamiliar with a Flag which they have not seen before for forty years,outside of the museum. For what Duluth has done, in building, equipping,and maintaining at her sole expense the American Foreign CommercialFleet, and in thus rescuing the American name from shame and lifting ithigh for the homage of the nations, we owe her a debt of gratitude whichour hearts shall confess with quickened beats whenever her name is namedhenceforth. Many national toasts will die in the lapse of time, butwhile the flag flies and the Republic survives, they who live under theirshelter will still drink this one, standing and uncovered: Health andprosperity to Thee, O Duluth, American Queen of the Alien Seas!
Row-boats began to flock from the shore; their crews were the firstnatives we had seen. These men carried no overplus of clothing, and thiswas wise, for the weather was hot. Handsome, great dusky men they were,muscular, clean-limbed, and with faces full of character andintelligence. It would be hard to find their superiors anywhere amongthe dark races, I should think.
Everybody went ashore to look around, and spy out the land, and have thatluxury of luxuries to sea-voyagers--a land-dinner. And there we saw morenatives: Wrinkled old women, with their flat mammals flung over theirshoulders, or hanging down in front like the cold-weather drip from themolasses-faucet; plump and smily young girls, blithe and content, easyand graceful, a pleasure to look at; young matrons, tall, straight,comely, nobly built, sweeping by with chin up, and a gait incomparablefor unconscious stateliness and dignity; majestic young men athletes forbuild and muscle clothed in a loose arrangement of dazzling white, withbronze breast and bronze legs naked, and the head a cannon-swab of solidhair combed straight out from the skull and dyed a rich brick-red. Onlysixty years ago they were sunk in darkness; now they have the bicycle.We strolled about the streets of the white folks' little town, and aroundover the hills by paths and roads among European dwellings and gardensand plantations, and past clumps of hibiscus that made a body blink, thegreat blossoms were so intensely red; and by and by we stopped to ask anelderly English colonist a question or two, and to sympathize with himconcerning the torrid weather; but he was surprised, and said:
"This? This is not hot. You ought to be here in the summer time once."
"We supposed that this was summer; it has the ear-marks of it. You couldtake it to almost any country and deceive people with it. But if itisn't summer, what does it lack?"
"It lacks half a year. This is mid-winter."
I had been suffering from colds for several months, and a sudden changeof season, like this, could hardly fail to do me hurt. It brought onanother cold. It is odd, these sudden jumps from season to season. Afortnight ago we left America in mid-summer, now it is midwinter; about aweek hence we shall arrive in Australia in the spring.
After dinner I found in the billiard-room a resident whom I had knownsomewhere else in the world, and presently made, some new friends anddrove with them out into the country to visit his Excellency the head ofthe State, who was occupying his country residence, to escape the rigorsof the winter weather, I suppose, for it was on breezy high ground andmuch more comfortable than the lower regions, where the town is, andwhere the winter has full swing, and often sets a person's hair afirewhen he takes off his hat to bow. There is a noble and beautiful view ofocean and islands and castellated peaks from the governor's high-placedhouse, and its immediate surroundings lie drowsing in that dreamy reposeand serenity which are the charm of life in the Pacific Islands.
One of the new friends who went out there with me was a large man, and Ihad been admiring his size all the way. I was still admiring it as hestood by the governor on the veranda, talking; then the Fijian butlerstepped out there to announce tea, and dwarfed him. Maybe he did notquite dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was quite striking.Perhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of politicalsuspension. I think that in the talk there on the veranda it was saidthat in Fiji, as in the Sandwich Islands, native kings and chiefs are ofmuch grander size and build than the commoners. This man was clothed inflowing white vestments, and they were just the thing for him; theycomported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity.European clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace. Iknow that, because they do that with everybody that wears them.
It was said that the old-time devotion to chiefs and reverence for theirpersons still survive in the native commoner, and in great force. Theeducated young gentleman who is chief of the tribe that live in theregion about the capital dresses in the fashion of high-class Europeangentlemen, but even his clothes cannot damn him in the reverence of hispeople. Their pride in his lofty rank and ancient lineage lives on, inspite of his lost authority and the evil magic of his tailor. He has noneed to defile himself with work, or trouble his heart with the sordidcares of life; the tribe will see to it that he shall not want, and thathe shall hold up his head and live like a gentleman. I had a glimpse ofhim down in the town. Perhaps he is a descendant of the last king--theking with the difficult name whose memory is preserved by a notablemonument of cut-stone which one sees in the enclosure in the middle ofthe town. Thakombau--I remember, now; that is the name. It is easier topreserve it on a granite block than in your head.
Fiji was ceded to England by this king in 1858. One of the gentlemenpresent at the governor's quoted a remark made by the king at the time ofthe session--a neat retort, and with a touch of pathos in it, too. TheEnglish Commissioner had offered a crumb of comfort to Thakombau bysaying that the transfer of the kingdom to Great Britain was merely "asort of hermit-crab formality, you know." "Yes," said poor Thakombau,"but with this difference--the crab moves into an unoccupied shell, butmine isn't."
However, as far as I can make out from the books, the King was betweenthe devil and the deep sea at the time, and hadn't much choice. He owedthe United States a large debt--a debt which he could pay if allowedtime, but time was denied him. He must pay up right away or the warshipswould be upon him. To protect his people from this disaster he ceded hiscountry to Britain, with a clause in the contract providing for theultimate payment of the American debt.
In old times the Fijians were fierce fighters; they were very religious,and worshiped idols; the big chiefs were proud and haughty, and they weremen of great style in many ways; all chiefs had several wives, thebiggest chiefs sometimes had as many as fifty; when a chief was dead andready for burial, four or five of his wives were strangled and put intothe grave with him. In 1804 twenty-seven British convicts escaped fromAustralia to Fiji, and brought guns and ammunition with them. Considerwhat a power they were, armed like that, and what an opportunity theyhad. If they had been energetic men and sober, and had had brains andknown how to use them, they could have achieved the sovereignty of thearchipelago twenty-seven kings and each with eight or nine islands underhis scepter. But nothing came of this chance. They lived worthlesslives of sin and luxury, and died without honor--in most cases byviolence. Only one of them had any ambition; he was an Irishman namedConnor. He tried to raise a family of fifty children, and scoredforty-eight. He died lamenting his failure. It was a foolish sortof avarice. Many a father would have been rich enough with forty.
It is a fine race, the Fijians, with brains in their heads, and aninquiring turn of mind. It appears that their savage ancestors had adoctrine of immortality in their scheme of religion--with limitations.That is to say, their dead friend would go to a happy hereafter if hecould be accumulated, but not otherwise. They drew the line; theythought that the missionary's doctrine was too sweeping, toocomprehensive. They called his attention to certain facts. Forinstance, many of their friends had been devoured by sharks; the sharks,in their turn, were caught and eaten by other men; later, these men werecaptured in war, and eaten by the enemy. The original persons hadentered into the composition of the sharks; next, they and the sharks hadbecome part of the flesh and blood and bone of the cannibals. How, then,could the particles of the original men be searched out from the finalconglomerate and put together again? The inquirers were full of doubts,and considered that the missionary had not examined the matter with--thegravity and attention which so serious a thing deserved.
The missionary taught these exacting savages many valuable things, andgot from them one--a very dainty and poetical idea: Those wild andignorant poor children of Nature believed that the flowers, after theyperish, rise on the winds and float away to the fair fields of heaven,and flourish there forever in immortal beauty!
