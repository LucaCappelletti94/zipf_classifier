Joan Persuades Her Inquisitors
WHEN JOAN told the King what that deep secret was that was torturing hisheart, his doubts were cleared away; he believed she was sent of God, andif he had been let alone he would have set her upon her great mission atonce. But he was not let alone. Tremouille and the holy fox of Rheimsknew their man. All they needed to say was this--and they said it:
"Your Highness says her Voices have revealed to you, by her mouth, asecret known only to yourself and God. How can you know that her Voicesare not of Satan, and she his mouthpiece?--for does not Satan know thesecrets of men and use his knowledge for the destruction of their souls?It is a dangerous business, and your Highness will do well not to proceedin it without probing the matter to the bottom."
That was enough. It shriveled up the King's little soul like a raisin,with terrors and apprehensions, and straightway he privately appointed acommission of bishops to visit and question Joan daily until they shouldfind out whether her supernatural helps hailed from heaven or from hell.
The King's relative, the Duke of Alencon, three years prisoner of war tothe English, was in these days released from captivity through promise ofa great ransom; and the name and fame of the Maid having reached him--forthe same filled all mouths now, and penetrated to all parts--he came toChinon to see with his own eyes what manner of creature she might be. TheKing sent for Joan and introduced her to the Duke. She said, in hersimple fashion:
"You are welcome; the more of the blood of France that is joined to thiscause, the better for the cause and it."
Then the two talked together, and there was just the usual result: whenthey departed, the Duke was her friend and advocate.
Joan attended the King's mass the next day, and afterward dined with theKing and the Duke. The King was learning to prize her company and valueher conversation; and that might well be, for, like other kings, he wasused to getting nothing out of people's talk but guarded phrases,colorless and non-committal, or carefully tinted to tally with the colorof what he said himself; and so this kind of conversation only vexes andbores, and is wearisome; but Joan's talk was fresh and free, sincere andhonest, and unmarred by timorous self-watching and constraint. She saidthe very thing that was in her mind, and said it in a plain,straightforward way. One can believe that to the King this must have beenlike fresh cold water from the mountains to parched lips used to thewater of the sun-baked puddles of the plain.
After dinner Joan so charmed the Duke with her horsemanship and lancepractice in the meadows by the Castle of Chinon whither the King also hadcome to look on, that he made her a present of a great black war-steed.
Every day the commission of bishops came and questioned Joan about herVoices and her mission, and then went to the King with their report.These pryings accomplished but little. She told as much as she consideredadvisable, and kept the rest to herself. Both threats and trickeries werewasted upon her. She did not care for the threats, and the traps caughtnothing. She was perfectly frank and childlike about these things. Sheknew the bishops were sent by the King, that their questions were theKing's questions, and that by all law and custom a King's questions mustbe answered; yet she told the King in her naive way at his own table oneday that she answered only such of those questions as suited her.
The bishops finally concluded that they couldn't tell whether Joan wassent by God or not. They were cautious, you see. There were two powerfulparties at Court; therefore to make a decision either way wouldinfallibly embroil them with one of those parties; so it seemed to themwisest to roost on the fence and shift the burden to other shoulders. Andthat is what they did. They made final report that Joan's case was beyondtheir powers, and recommended that it be put into the hands of thelearned and illustrious doctors of the University of Poitiers. Then theyretired from the field, leaving behind them this little item oftestimony, wrung from them by Joan's wise reticence: they said she was a"gentle and simple little shepherdess, very candid, but not given totalking."
It was quite true--in their case. But if they could have looked back andseen her with us in the happy pastures of Domremy, they would haveperceived that she had a tongue that could go fast enough when no harmcould come of her words.
So we traveled to Poitiers, to endure there three weeks of tedious delaywhile this poor child was being daily questioned and badgered before agreat bench of--what? Military experts?--since what she had come to applyfor was an army and the privilege of leading it to battle against theenemies of France. Oh no; it was a great bench of priests andmonks--profoundly leaned and astute casuists--renowned professors oftheology! Instead of setting a military commission to find out if thisvalorous little soldier could win victories, they set a company of holyhair-splitters and phrase-mongers to work to find out if the soldier wassound in her piety and had no doctrinal leaks. The rats were devouringthe house, but instead of examining the cat's teeth and claws, they onlyconcerned themselves to find out if it was a holy cat. If it was a piouscat, a moral cat, all right, never mind about the other capacities, theywere of no consequence.
Joan was as sweetly self-possessed and tranquil before this grimtribunal, with its robed celebrities, its solemn state and imposingceremonials, as if she were but a spectator and not herself on trial. Shesat there, solitary on her bench, untroubled, and disconcerted thescience of the sages with her sublime ignorance--an ignorance which was afortress; arts, wiles, the learning drawn from books, and all likemissiles rebounded from its unconscious masonry and fell to the groundharmless; they could not dislodge the garrison which was within--Joan'sserene great heart and spirit, the guards and keepers of her mission.
She answered all questions frankly, and she told all the story of hervisions and of her experiences with the angels and what they said to her;and the manner of the telling was so unaffected, and so earnest andsincere, and made it all seem so lifelike and real, that even that hardpractical court forgot itself and sat motionless and mute, listening witha charmed and wondering interest to the end. And if you would have othertestimony than mine, look in the histories and you will find where aneyewitness, giving sworn testimony in the Rehabilitation process, saysthat she told that tale "with a noble dignity and simplicity," and as toits effect, says in substance what I have said. Seventeen, shewas--seventeen, and all alone on her bench by herself; yet was notafraid, but faced that great company of erudite doctors of law anttheology, and by the help of no art learned in the schools, but usingonly the enchantments which were hers by nature, of youth, sincerity, avoice soft and musical, and an eloquence whose source was the heart, notthe head, she laid that spell upon them. Now was not that a beautifulthing to see? If I could, I would put it before you just as I saw it;then I know what you would say.
As I have told you, she could not read. "One day they harried andpestered her with arguments, reasonings, objections, and other windy andwordy trivialities, gathered out of the works of this and that and theother great theological authority, until at last her patience vanished,and she turned upon them sharply and said:
"I don't know A from B; but I know this: that I am come by command of theLord of Heaven to deliver Orleans from the English power and crown theKing of Rheims, and the matters ye are puttering over are of noconsequence!"
Necessarily those were trying days for her, and wearing for everybodythat took part; but her share was the hardest, for she had no holidays,but must be always on hand and stay the long hours through, whereas this,that, and the other inquisitor could absent himself and rest up from hisfatigues when he got worn out. And yet she showed no wear, no weariness,and but seldom let fly her temper. As a rule she put her day throughcalm, alert, patient, fencing with those veteran masters of scholarlysword-play and coming out always without a scratch.
One day a Dominican sprung upon her a question which made everybody cockup his ears with interest; as for me, I trembled, and said to myself sheis done this time, poor Joan, for there is no way of answering this. Thesly Dominican began in this way--in a sort of indolent fashion, as if thething he was about was a matter of no moment:
"You assert that God has willed to deliver France from this Englishbondage?"
"Yes, He has willed it."
"You wish for men-at-arms, so that you may go to the relief of Orleans, Ibelieve?"
"Yes--and the sooner the better."
"God is all-powerful, and able to do whatsoever thing He wills to do, isit not so?"
"Most surely. None doubts it."
The Dominican lifted his head suddenly, and sprung that question I havespoken of, with exultation:
"Then answer me this. If He has willed to deliver France, and is able todo whatsoever He wills, where is the need for men-at-arms?"
There was a fine stir and commotion when he said that, and a suddenthrusting forward of heads and putting up of hands to ears to catch theanswer; and the Dominican wagged his head with satisfaction, and lookedabout him collecting his applause, for it shone in every face. But Joanwas not disturbed. There was no note of disquiet in her voice when sheanswered:
"He helps who help themselves. The sons of France will fight the battles,but He will give the victory!"
You could see a light of admiration sweep the house from face to facelike a ray from the sun. Even the Dominican himself looked pleased, tosee his master-stroke so neatly parried, and I heard a venerable bishopmutter, in the phrasing common to priest and people in that robust time,"By God, the child has said true. He willed that Goliath should be slain,and He sent a child like this to do it!"
Another day, when the inquisition had dragged along until everybodylooked drowsy and tired but Joan, Brother Seguin, professor of theologyat the University of Poitiers, who was a sour and sarcastic man, fell toplying Joan with all sorts of nagging questions in his bastard LimousinFrench--for he was from Limoges. Finally he said:
"How is it that you understand those angels? What language did theyspeak?"
"French."
"In-deed! How pleasant to know that our language is so honored! GoodFrench?"
"Yes--perfect."
"Perfect, eh? Well, certainly you ought to know. It was even better thanyour own, eh?"
"As to that, I--I believe I cannot say," said she, and was going on, butstopped. Then she added, almost as if she were saying it to herself,"Still, it was an improvement on yours!"
I knew there was a chuckle back of her eyes, for all their innocence.Everybody shouted. Brother Seguin was nettled, and asked brusquely:
"Do you believe in God?"
Joan answered with an irritating nonchalance:
"Oh, well, yes--better than you, it is likely."
Brother Seguin lost his patience, and heaped sarcasm after sarcasm uponher, and finally burst out in angry earnest, exclaiming:
"Very well, I can tell you this, you whose believe in God is so great:God has not willed that any shall believe in you without a sign. Where isyour sign?--show it!"
This roused Joan, and she was on her feet in a moment, and flung out herretort with spirit:
"I have not come to Poitiers to show signs and do miracles. Send me toOrleans and you shall have signs enough. Give me men-at-arms--few ormany--and let me go!"
The fire was leaping from her eyes--ah, the heroic little figure! can'tyou see her? There was a great burst of acclamations, and she sat downblushing, for it was not in her delicate nature to like beingconspicuous.
This speech and that episode about the French language scored two pointsagainst Brother Seguin, while he scored nothing against Joan; yet, sourman as he was, he was a manly man, and honest, as you can see by thehistories; for at the Rehabilitation he could have hidden those unluckyincidents if he had chosen, but he didn't do it, but spoke them right outin his evidence.
On one of the latter days of that three-weeks session the gowned scholarsand professors made one grand assault all along the line, fairlyoverwhelming Joan with objections and arguments culled from the writingsof every ancient and illustrious authority of the Roman Church. She waswell-nigh smothered; but at last she shook herself free and struck back,crying out:
"Listen! The Book of God is worth more than all these ye cite, and Istand upon it. And I tell ye there are things in that Book that not oneamong ye can read, with all your learning!"
From the first she was the guest, by invitation, of the dame De Rabateau,wife of a councilor of the Parliament of Poitiers; and to that house thegreat ladies of the city came nightly to see Joan and talk with her; andnot these only, but the old lawyers, councilors and scholars of theParliament and the University. And these grave men, accustomed to weighevery strange and questionable thing, and cautiously consider it, andturn it about this way and that and still doubt it, came night afternight, and night after night, falling ever deeper and deeper under theinfluence of that mysterious something, that spell, that elusive andunwordable fascination, which was the supremest endowment of Joan of Arc,that winning and persuasive and convincing something which high and lowalike recognized and felt, but which neither high nor low could explainor describe, and one by one they all surrendered, saying, "This child issent of God."
All day long Joan, in the great court and subject to its rigid rules ofprocedure, was at a disadvantage; her judges had things their own way;but at night she held court herself, and matters were reversed, shepresiding, with her tongue free and her same judges there before her.There could not be but one result: all the objections and hindrances theycould build around her with their hard labors of the day she would charmaway at night. In the end, she carried her judges with her in a mass, andgot her great verdict without a dissenting voice.
The court was a sight to see when the president of it read it from histhrone, for all the great people of the town were there who could getadmission and find room. First there were some solemn ceremonies, properand usual at such times; then, when there was silence again, the readingfollowed, penetrating the deep hush so that every word was heard in eventhe remotest parts of the house:
"It is found, and is hereby declared, that Joan of Arc, called the Maid,is a good Christian and a good Catholic; that there is nothing in herperson or her words contrary to the faith; and that the King may andought to accept the succor she offers; for to repel it would be to offendthe Holy Spirit, and render him unworthy of the air of God."
The court rose, and then the storm of plaudits burst forth unrebuked,dying down and bursting forth again and again, and I lost sight of Joan,for she was swallowed up in a great tide of people who rushed tocongratulate her and pour out benedictions upon her and upon the cause ofFrance, now solemnly and irrevocably delivered into her little hands.
