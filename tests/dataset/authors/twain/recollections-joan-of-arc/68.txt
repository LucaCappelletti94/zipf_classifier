Our Last Hopes of Rescue Fail
JOAN HAD been adjudged guilty of heresy, sorcery, and all the otherterrible crimes set forth in the Twelve Articles, and her life was inCauchon's hands at last. He could send her to the stake at once. His workwas finished now, you think? He was satisfied? Not at all. What would hisArchbishopric be worth if the people should get the idea into their headsthat this faction of interested priests, slaving under the English lash,had wrongly condemned and burned Joan of Arc, Deliverer of France? Thatwould be to make of her a holy martyr. Then her spirit would rise fromher body's ashes, a thousandfold reinforced, and sweep the Englishdomination into the sea, and Cauchon along with it. No, the victory wasnot complete yet. Joan's guilt must be established by evidence whichwould satisfy the people. Where was that evidence to be found? There wasonly one person in the world who could furnish it--Joan of Arc herself.She must condemn herself, and in public--at least she must seem to do it.
But how was this to be managed? Weeks had been spent already in trying toget her to surrender--time wholly wasted; what was to persuade her now?Torture had been threatened, the fire had been threatened; what was left?Illness, deadly fatigue, and the sight of the fire, the presence of thefire! That was left.
Now that was a shrewd thought. She was but a girl after all, and, underillness and exhaustion, subject to a girl's weaknesses.
Yes, it was shrewdly thought. She had tacitly said herself that under thebitter pains of the rack they would be able to extort a false confessionfrom her. It was a hint worth remembering, and it was remembered.
She had furnished another hint at the same time: that as soon as thepains were gone, she would retract the confession. That hint was alsoremembered.
She had herself taught them what to do, you see. First, they must wearout her strength, then frighten her with the fire. Second, while thefright was on her, she must be made to sign a paper.
But she would demand a reading of the paper. They could not venture torefuse this, with the public there to hear. Suppose that during thereading her courage should return?--she would refuse to sign then. Verywell, even that difficulty could be got over. They could read a shortpaper of no importance, then slip a long and deadly one into its placeand trick her into signing that.
Yet there was still one other difficulty. If they made her seem toabjure, that would free her from the death-penalty. They could keep herin a prison of the Church, but they could not kill her.
That would not answer; for only her death would content the English.Alive she was a terror, in a prison or out of it. She had escaped fromtwo prisons already.
But even that difficulty could be managed. Cauchon would make promises toher; in return she would promise to leave off the male dress. He wouldviolate his promises, and that would so situate her that she would not beable to keep hers. Her lapse would condemn her to the stake, and thestake would be ready.
These were the several moves; there was nothing to do but to make them,each in its order, and the game was won. One might almost name the daythat the betrayed girl, the most innocent creature in France and thenoblest, would go to her pitiful death.
The world knows now that Cauchon's plan was as I have sketched it to you,but the world did not know it at that time. There are sufficientindications that Warwick and all the other English chiefs except thehighest one--the Cardinal of Winchester--were not let into the secret,also, that only Loyseleur and Beaupere, on the French side, knew thescheme. Sometimes I have doubted if even Loyseleur and Beaupere knew thewhole of it at first. However, if any did, it was these two.
It is usual to let the condemned pass their last night of life in peace,but this grace was denied to poor Joan, if one may credit the rumors ofthe time. Loyseleur was smuggled into her presence, and in the characterof priest, friend, and secret partisan of France and hater of England, hespent some hours in beseeching her to do "the only right an righteousthing"--submit to the Church, as a good Christian should; and that thenshe would straightway get out of the clutches of the dreaded English andbe transferred to the Church's prison, where she would be honorably usedand have women about her for jailers. He knew where to touch her. He knewhow odious to her was the presence of her rough and profane Englishguards; he knew that her Voices had vaguely promised something which sheinterpreted to be escape, rescue, release of some sort, and the chance toburst upon France once more and victoriously complete the great workwhich she had been commissioned of Heaven to do. Also there was thatother thing: if her failing body could be further weakened by loss ofrest and sleep now, her tired mind would be dazed and drowsy on themorrow, and in ill condition to stand out against persuasions, threats,and the sight of the stake, and also be purblind to traps and snareswhich it would be swift to detect when in its normal estate.
I do not need to tell you that there was no rest for me that night. Norfor Noel. We went to the main gate of the city before nightfall, with ahope in our minds, based upon that vague prophecy of Joan's Voices whichseemed to promise a rescue by force at the last moment. The immense newshad flown swiftly far and wide that at last Joan of Arc was condemned,and would be sentenced and burned alive on the morrow; and so crowds ofpeople were flowing in at the gate, and other crowds were being refusedadmission by the soldiery; these being people who brought doubtful passesor none at all. We scanned these crowds eagerly, but thee was nothingabout them to indicate that they were our old war-comrades in disguise,and certainly there were no familiar faces among them. And so, when thegate was closed at last, we turned away grieved, and more disappointedthan we cared to admit, either in speech or thought.
The streets were surging tides of excited men. It was difficult to makeone's way. Toward midnight our aimless tramp brought us to theneighborhood of the beautiful church of St. Ouen, and there all wasbustle and work. The square was a wilderness of torches and people; andthrough a guarded passage dividing the pack, laborers were carryingplanks and timbers and disappearing with them through the gate of thechurchyard. We asked what was going forward; the answer was:
"Scaffolds and the stake. Don't you know that the French witch is to beburned in the morning?"
Then we went away. We had no heart for that place.
At dawn we were at the city gate again; this time with a hope which ourwearied bodies and fevered minds magnified into a large probability. Wehad heard a report that the Abbot of Jumieges with all his monks wascoming to witness the burning. Our desire, abetted by our imagination,turned those nine hundred monks into Joan's old campaigners, and theirAbbot into La Hire or the Bastard or D'Alencon; and we watched them filein, unchallenged, the multitude respectfully dividing and uncoveringwhile they passed, with our hearts in our throats and our eyes swimmingwith tears of joy and pride and exultation; and we tried to catchglimpses of the faces under the cowls, and were prepared to give signalto any recognized face that we were Joan's men and ready and eager tokill and be killed in the good cause. How foolish we were!
But we were young, you know, and youth hopeth all things, believeth allthings.
