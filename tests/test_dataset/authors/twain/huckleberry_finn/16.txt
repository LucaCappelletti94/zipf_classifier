We went drifting down into a big bend, and thenight clouded up and got hot. The river was verywide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides;you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether wewould know it when we got to it. I said likely wewouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't butabout a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happento have them lit up, how was we going to know wewas passing a town? Jim said if the two big riversjoined together there, that would show. But I saidmaybe we might think we was passing the foot of anisland and coming into the same old river again. Thatdisturbed Jim -- and me too. So the question was,what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time alight showed, and tell them pap was behind, comingalong with a trading-scow, and was a green hand atthe business, and wanted to know how far it was toCairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took asmoke on it and waited.
There warn't nothing to do now but to look outsharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it.He said he'd be mighty sure to see it, because he'd bea free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed ithe'd be in a slave country again and no more show forfreedom. Every little while he jumps up and says:
"Dah she is?"
But it warn't. It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightningbugs; so he set down again, and went to watching,same as before. Jim said it made him all over tremblyand feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I cantell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too,to hear him, because I begun to get it through myhead that he WAS most free -- and who was to blamefor it? Why, ME. I couldn't get that out of my con-science, no how nor no way. It got to troubling meso I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay still in one place.It hadn't ever come home to me before, what thisthing was that I was doing. But now it did; and itstayed with me, and scorched me more and more. Itried to make out to myself that I warn't to blame,because I didn't run Jim off from his rightful owner;but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, everytime, "But you knowed he was running for his free-dom, and you could a paddled ashore and told some-body." That was so -- I couldn't get around thatnoway. That was where it pinched. Conscience saysto me, "What had poor Miss Watson done to youthat you could see her nigger go off right under youreyes and never say one single word? What did thatpoor old woman do to you that you could treat her somean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she triedto learn you your manners, she tried to be good to youevery way she knowed how. THAT'S what she done."
I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wishedI was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusingmyself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and downpast me. We neither of us could keep still. Everytime he danced around and says, "Dah's Cairo!" itwent through me like a shot, and I thought if it WASCairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness.
Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talkingto myself. He was saying how the first thing hewould do when he got to a free State he would go tosaving up money and never spend a single cent, andwhen he got enough he would buy his wife, which wasowned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived;and then they would both work to buy the two chil-dren, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'dget an Ab'litionist to go and steal them.
It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn'tever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Justsee what a difference it made in him the minute hejudged he was about free. It was according to the oldsaying, "Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell."Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking.Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helpedto run away, coming right out flat-footed and sayinghe would steal his children -- children that belonged toa man I didn't even know; a man that hadn't everdone me no harm.
I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such alowering of him. My conscience got to stirring me uphotter than ever, until at last I says to it, "Let up onme -- it ain't too late yet -- I'll paddle ashore at thefirst light and tell." I felt easy and happy and lightas a feather right off. All my troubles was gone. Iwent to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of sing-ing to myself. By and by one showed. Jim singsout:
"We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crackyo' heels! Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knowsit!"
I says:
"I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. Itmightn't be, you know."
He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his oldcoat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me thepaddle; and as I shoved off, he says:
"Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say,it's all on accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en Icouldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for Huck; Huckdone it. Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck; you's debes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de ONLY fren' oleJim's got now."
I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; butwhen he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuckall out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn'tright down certain whether I was glad I started orwhether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jimsays:
"Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y whitegenlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole Jim."
Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I GOT to do it -- Ican't get OUT of it. Right then along comes a skiffwith two men in it with guns, and they stopped and Istopped. One of them says:
"What's that yonder?"
"A piece of a raft," I says.
"Do you belong on it?"
"Yes, sir."
"Any men on it?"
"Only one, sir."
"Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yon-der, above the head of the bend. Is your man whiteor black?"
I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but thewords wouldn't come. I tried for a second or two tobrace up and out with it, but I warn't man enough --hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening;so I just give up trying, and up and says:
"He's white."
"I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves."
"I wish you would," says I, "because it's papthat's there, and maybe you'd help me tow the raftashore where the light is. He's sick -- and so is mamand Mary Ann."
"Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. But Is'pose we've got to. Come, buckle to your paddle,and let's get along."
I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars.When we had made a stroke or two, I says:
"Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I cantell you. Everybody goes away when I want them tohelp me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it bymyself."
"Well, that's infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy,what's the matter with your father?"
"It's the -- a -- the -- well, it ain't anything much."
They stopped pulling. It warn't but a mighty littleways to the raft now. One says:
"Boy, that's a lie. What IS the matter with yourpap? Answer up square now, and it'll be the betterfor you."
"I will, sir, I will, honest -- but don't leave us,please. It's the -- the -- Gentlemen, if you'll onlypull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, youwon't have to come a-near the raft -- please do."
"Set her back, John, set her back!" says one.They backed water. "Keep away, boy -- keep tolooard. Confound it, I just expect the wind hasblowed it to us. Your pap's got the small-pox, andyou know it precious well. Why didn't you come outand say so? Do you want to spread it all over?"
"Well," says I, a-blubbering, "I've told every-body before, and they just went away and left us."
"Poor devil, there's something in that. We areright down sorry for you, but we -- well, hang it, wedon't want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I'lltell you what to do. Don't you try to land by your-self, or you'll smash everything to pieces. You floatalong down about twenty miles, and you'll come to atown on the left-hand side of the river. It will belong after sun-up then, and when you ask for helpyou tell them your folks are all down with chills andfever. Don't be a fool again, and let people guesswhat is the matter. Now we're trying to do you akindness; so you just put twenty miles between us,that's a good boy. It wouldn't do any good to landyonder where the light is -- it's only a wood-yard.Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound tosay he's in pretty hard luck. Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when itfloats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but mykingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox, don'tyou see?"
"Hold on, Parker," says the other man, "here's atwenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy;you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll be allright."
"That's so, my boy -- good-bye, good-bye. If yousee any runaway niggers you get help and nab them,and you can make some money by it."
"Good-bye, sir," says I; "I won't let no runawayniggers get by me if I can help it."
They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling badand low, because I knowed very well I had donewrong, and I see it warn't no use for me to try tolearn to do right; a body that don't get STARTED rightwhen he's little ain't got no show -- when the pinchcomes there ain't nothing to back him up and keephim to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I thoughta minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd adone right and give Jim up, would you felt better thanwhat you do now? No, says I, I'd feel bad -- I'd feeljust the same way I do now. Well, then, says I,what's the use you learning to do right when it'stroublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to dowrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck.I couldn't answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn'tbother no more about it, but after this always dowhichever come handiest at the time.
I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I lookedall around; he warn't anywhere. I says:
"Jim!"
"Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o' sight yit? Don'ttalk loud."
He was in the river under the stern oar, with justhis nose out. I told him they were out of sight, so hecome aboard. He says:
"I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into deriver en was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey comeaboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf' aginwhen dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool'em, Huck! Dat WUZ de smartes' dodge! I tell you,chile, I'spec it save' ole Jim -- ole Jim ain't going toforgit you for dat, honey."
Then we talked about the money. It was a prettygood raise -- twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we couldtake deck passage on a steamboat now, and the moneywould last us as far as we wanted to go in the freeStates. He said twenty mile more warn't far for theraft to go, but he wished we was already there.
Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mightyparticular about hiding the raft good. Then he workedall day fixing things in bundles, and getting all readyto quit rafting.
That night about ten we hove in sight of the lightsof a town away down in a left-hand bend.
I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon Ifound a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says:
"Mister, is that town Cairo?"
"Cairo? no. You must be a blame' fool."
"What town is it, mister?"
"If you want to know, go and find out. If youstay here botherin' around me for about a half a minutelonger you'll get something you won't want."
I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed,but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place,I reckoned.
We passed another town before daylight, and I wasgoing out again; but it was high ground, so I didn'tgo. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I hadforgot it. We laid up for the day on a towheadtolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun tosuspicion something. So did Jim. I says:
"Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night."
He says:
"Doan' le's talk about it, Huck. Po' niggers can'thave no luck. I awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skinwarn't done wid its work."
"I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim -- I dowish I'd never laid eyes on it."
"It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. Don'tyou blame yo'self 'bout it."
When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio waterinshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regularMuddy! So it was all up with Cairo.
We talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to theshore; we couldn't take the raft up the stream, ofcourse. There warn't no way but to wait for dark,and start back in the canoe and take the chances. Sowe slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, soas to be fresh for the work, and when we went back tothe raft about dark the canoe was gone!
We didn't say a word for a good while. Therewarn't anything to say. We both knowed well enoughit was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; sowhat was the use to talk about it? It would only looklike we was finding fault, and that would be bound tofetch more bad luck -- and keep on fetching it, too, tillwe knowed enough to keep still.
By and by we talked about what we better do, andfound there warn't no way but just to go along downwith the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to goback in. We warn't going to borrow it when therewarn't anybody around, the way pap would do, forthat might set people after us.
So we shoved out after dark on the raft.
Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness tohandle a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin donefor us, will believe it now if they read on and see whatmore it done for us.
The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up atshore. But we didn't see no rafts laying up; so wewent along during three hours and more. Well, thenight got gray and ruther thick, which is the nextmeanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of theriver, and you can't see no distance. It got to bevery late and still, and then along comes a steamboatup the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she wouldsee it. Up-stream boats didn't generly come close tous; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easywater under the reefs; but nights like this they bullright up the channel against the whole river.
We could hear her pounding along, but we didn'tsee her good till she was close. She aimed right forus. Often they do that and try to see how close theycan come without touching; sometimes the wheel bitesoff a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out andlaughs, and thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here shecomes, and we said she was going to try and shave us;but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She wasa big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, lookinglike a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it;but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, witha long row of wide-open furnace doors shining likered-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guardshanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and ajingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow ofcussing, and whistling of steam -- and as Jim wentoverboard on one side and I on the other, she comesmashing straight through the raft.
I dived -- and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for athirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wantedit to have plenty of room. I could always stay underwater a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under aminute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in ahurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to myarmpits and blowed the water out of my nose, andpuffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current;and of course that boat started her engines again tenseconds after she stopped them, for they never caredmuch for raftsmen; so now she was churning along upthe river, out of sight in the thick weather, though Icould hear her.
I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn'tget any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched mewhile I was "treading water," and struck out forshore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out tosee that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; soI changed off and went that way.
It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile cross-ings; so I was a good long time in getting over. Imade a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I couldn'tsee but a little ways, but I went poking along overrough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, andthen I run across a big old-fashioned double log-housebefore I noticed it. I was going to rush by and getaway, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howl-ing and barking at me, and I knowed better than tomove another peg.
