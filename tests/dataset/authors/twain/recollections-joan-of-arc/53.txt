All Ready to Condemn
ON TUESDAY, the 20th of February, while I sat at my master's work in theevening, he came in, looking sad, and said it had been decided to beginthe trial at eight o'clock the next morning, and I must get ready toassist him.
Of course I had been expecting such news every day for many days; but nomatter, the shock of it almost took my breath away and set me tremblinglike a leaf. I suppose that without knowing it I had been half imaginingthat at the last moment something would happen, something that would stopthis fatal trial; maybe that La Hire would burst in at the gates with hishellions at his back; maybe that God would have pity and stretch forthHis mighty hand. But now--now there was no hope.
The trial was to begin in the chapel of the fortress and would be public.So I went sorrowing away and told Noel, so that he might be there earlyand secure a place. It would give him a chance to look again upon theface which we so revered and which was so precious to us. All the way,both going and coming, I plowed through chattering and rejoicingmultitudes of English soldiery and English-hearted French citizens. Therewas no talk but of the coming event. Many times I heard the remark,accompanied by a pitiless laugh:
"The fat Bishop has got things as he wants them at last, and says he willlead the vile witch a merry dance and a short one."
But here and there I glimpsed compassion and distress in a face, and itwas not always a French one. English soldiers feared Joan, but theyadmired her for her great deeds and her unconquerable spirit.
In the morning Manchon and I went early, yet as we approached the vastfortress we found crowds of men already there and still others gathering.The chapel was already full and the way barred against further admissionsof unofficial persons. We took our appointed places. Throned on high satthe president, Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, in his grand robes, andbefore him in rows sat his robed court--fifty distinguishedecclesiastics, men of high degree in the Church, of clear-cutintellectual faces, men of deep learning, veteran adepts in strategy andcasuistry, practised setters of traps for ignorant minds and unwary feet.When I looked around upon this army of masters of legal fence, gatheredhere to find just one verdict and no other, and remembered that Joan mustfight for her good name and her life single-handed against them, I askedmyself what chance an ignorant poor country-girl of nineteen could havein such an unequal conflict; and my heart sank down low, very low. When Ilooked again at that obese president, puffing and wheezing there, hisgreat belly distending and receding with each breath, and noted his threechins, fold above fold, and his knobby and knotty face, and his purpleand splotchy complexion, and his repulsive cauliflower nose, and his coldand malignant eyes--a brute, every detail of him--my heart sank lowerstill. And when I noted that all were afraid of this man, and shrank andfidgeted in their seats when his eye smote theirs, my last poor ray ofhope dissolved away and wholly disappeared.
There was one unoccupied seat in this place, and only one. It was overagainst the wall, in view of every one. It was a little wooden benchwithout a back, and it stood apart and solitary on a sort of dais. Tallmen-at-arms in morion, breastplate, and steel gauntlets stood as stiff astheir own halberds on each side of this dais, but no other creature wasnear by it. A pathetic little bench to me it was, for I knew whom it wasfor; and the sight of it carried my mind back to the great court atPoitiers, where Joan sat upon one like it and calmly fought her cunningfight with the astonished doctors of the Church and Parliament, and rosefrom it victorious and applauded by all, and went forth to fill the worldwith the glory of her name.
What a dainty little figure she was, and how gentle and innocent, howwinning and beautiful in the fresh bloom of her seventeen years! Thosewere grand days. And so recent--for she was just nineteen now--and howmuch she had seen since, and what wonders she had accomplished!
But now--oh, all was changed now. She had been languishing in dungeons,away from light and air and the cheer of friendly faces, for nearlythree-quarters of a year--she, born child of the sun, natural comrade ofthe birds and of all happy free creatures. She would be weary now, andworn with this long captivity, her forces impaired; despondent, perhaps,as knowing there was no hope. Yes, all was changed.
All this time there had been a muffled hum of conversation, and rustlingof robes and scraping of feet on the floor, a combination of dull noiseswhich filled all the place. Suddenly:
"Produce the accused!"
It made me catch my breath. My heart began to thump like a hammer. Butthere was silence now--silence absolute. All those noises ceased, and itwas as if they had never been. Not a sound; the stillness grewoppressive; it was like a weight upon one. All faces were turned towardthe door; and one could properly expect that, for most of the peoplethere suddenly realized, no doubt, that they were about to see, in actualflesh and blood, what had been to them before only an embodied prodigy, aword, a phrase, a world-girdling Name.
The stillness continued. Then, far down the stone-paved corridors, oneheard a vague slow sound approaching: clank . . . clink . . . clank--Joanof Arc, Deliverer of France, in chains!
My head swam; all things whirled and spun about me. Ah, I was realizing,too.
