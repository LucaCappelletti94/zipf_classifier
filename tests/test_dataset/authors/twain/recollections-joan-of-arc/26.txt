Joan's First Battle-Field
ABOUT NOON I was chatting with Madame Boucher; nothing was going on, allwas quiet, when Catherine Boucher suddenly entered in great excitement,and said:
"Fly, sir, fly! The Maid was doing in her chair in my room, when shesprang up and cried out, 'French blood is flowing!--my arms, give me myarms!' Her giant was on guard at the door, and he brought D'Aulon, whobegan to arm her, and I and the giant have been warning the staff.Fly!--and stay by her; and if there really is a battle, keep her out ofit--don't let her risk herself--there is no need--if the men know she isnear and looking on, it is all that is necessary. Keep her out of thefight--don't fail of this!"
I started on a run, saying, sarcastically--for I was always fond ofsarcasm, and it was said that I had a most neat gift that way:
"Oh, yes, nothing easier than that--I'll attend to it!"
At the furthest end of the house I met Joan, fully armed, hurrying towardthe door, and she said:
"Ah, French blood is being spilt, and you did not tell me."
"Indeed I did not know it," I said; "there are no sounds of war;everything is quiet, your Excellency."
"You will hear war-sounds enough in a moment," she said, and was gone.
It was true. Before one could count five there broke upon the stillnessthe swelling rush and tramp of an approaching multitude of men andhorses, with hoarse cries of command; and then out of the distance camethe muffled deep boom!--boom-boom!--boom! of cannon, and straightway thatrushing multitude was roaring by the house like a hurricane.
Our knights and all our staff came flying, armed, but with no horsesready, and we burst out after Joan in a body, the Paladin in the leadwith the banner. The surging crowd was made up half of citizens and halfof soldiers, and had no recognized leader. When Joan was seen a huzzawent up, and she shouted:
"A horse--a horse!"
A dozen saddles were at her disposal in a moment. She mounted, a hundredpeople shouting:
"Way, there--way for the MAID OF ORLEANS!" The first time that thatimmortal name was ever uttered--and I, praise God, was there to hear it!The mass divided itself like the waters of the Red Sea, and down thislane Joan went skimming like a bird, crying, "Forward, Frenchhearts--follow me!" and we came winging in her wake on the rest of theborrowed horses, the holy standard streaming above us, and the laneclosing together in our rear.
This was a different thing from the ghastly march past the dismalbastilles. No, we felt fine, now, and all awhirl with enthusiasm. Theexplanation of this sudden uprising was this. The city and the littlegarrison, so long hopeless and afraid, had gone wild over Joan's coming,and could no longer restrain their desire to get at the enemy; so,without orders from anybody, a few hundred soldiers and citizens hadplunged out at the Burgundy gate on a sudden impulse and made a charge onone of Lord Talbot's most formidable fortresses--St. Loup--and weregetting the worst of it. The news of this had swept through the city andstarted this new crowd that we were with.
As we poured out at the gate we met a force bringing in the wounded fromthe front. The sight moved Joan, and she said:
"Ah, French blood; it makes my hair rise to see it!"
We were soon on the field, soon in the midst of the turmoil. Joan wasseeing her first real battle, and so were we.
It was a battle in the open field; for the garrison of St. Loup hadsallied confidently out to meet the attack, being used to victories when"witches" were not around. The sally had been reinforced by troops fromthe "Paris" bastille, and when we approached the French were gettingwhipped and were falling back. But when Joan came charging through thedisorder with her banner displayed, crying "Forward, men--follow me!"there was a change; the French turned about and surged forward like asolid wave of the sea, and swept the English before them, hacking andslashing, and being hacked and slashed, in a way that was terrible tosee.
In the field the Dwarf had no assignment; that is to say, he was notunder orders to occupy any particular place, therefore he chose his placefor himself, and went ahead of Joan and made a road for her. It washorrible to see the iron helmets fly into fragments under his dreadfulax. He called it cracking nuts, and it looked like that. He made a goodroad, and paved it well with flesh and iron. Joan and the rest of usfollowed it so briskly that we outspeeded our forces and had the Englishbehind us as well as before. The knights commanded us to face outwardaround Joan, which we did, and then there was work done that was fine tosee. One was obliged to respect the Paladin, now. Being right underJoan's exalting and transforming eye, he forgot his native prudence, heforgot his diffidence in the presence of danger, he forgot what fear was,and he never laid about him in his imaginary battles in a more tremendousway that he did in this real one; and wherever he struck there was anenemy the less.
We were in that close place only a few minutes; then our forces to therear broke through with a great shout and joined us, and then the Englishfought a retreating fight, but in a fine and gallant way, and we drovethem to their fortress foot by foot, they facing us all the time, andtheir reserves on the walls raining showers of arrows, cross-bow bolts,and stone cannon-balls upon us.
The bulk of the enemy got safely within the works and left us outsidewith piles of French and English dead and wounded for company--asickening sight, an awful sight to us youngsters, for our little ambushfights in February had been in the night, and the blood and themutilations and the dead faces were mercifully dim, whereas we saw thesethings now for the first time in all their naked ghastliness.
Now arrived Dunois from the city, and plunged through the battle on hisfoam-flecked horse and galloped up to Joan, saluting, and utteringhandsome compliments as he came. He waved his hand toward the distantwalls of the city, where a multitude of flags were flaunting gaily in thewind, and said the populace were up there observing her fortunateperformance and rejoicing over it, and added that she and the forceswould have a great reception now.
"Now? Hardly now, Bastard. Not yet!"
"Why not yet? Is there more to be done?"
"More, Bastard? We have but begun! We will take this fortress."
"Ah, you can't be serious! We can't take this place; let me urge you notto make the attempt; it is too desperate. Let me order the forces back."
Joan's heart was overflowing with the joys and enthusiasms of war, and itmade her impatient to hear such talk. She cried out:
"Bastard, Bastard, will ye play always with these English? Now verily Itell you we will not budge until this place is ours. We will carry it bystorm. Sound the charge!"
"Ah, my General--"
"Waste no more time, man--let the bugles sound the assault!" and we sawthat strange deep light in her eye which we named the battle-light, andlearned to know so well in later fields.
The martial notes pealed out, the troops answered with a yell, and downthey came against that formidable work, whose outlines were lost in itsown cannon-smoke, and whose sides were spouting flame and thunder.
We suffered repulse after repulse, but Joan was here and there andeverywhere encouraging the men, and she kept them to their work. Duringthree hours the tide ebbed and flowed, flowed and ebbed; but at last LaHire, who was now come, made a final and resistless charge, and thebastille St. Loup was ours. We gutted it, taking all its stores andartillery, and then destroyed it.
When all our host was shouting itself hoarse with rejoicings, and therewent up a cry for the General, for they wanted to praise her and glorifyher and do her homage for her victory, we had trouble to find her; andwhen we did find her, she was off by herself, sitting among a ruck ofcorpses, with her face in her hands, crying--for she was a young girl,you know, and her hero heart was a young girl's heart too, with the pityand the tenderness that are natural to it. She was thinking of themothers of those dead friends and enemies.
Among the prisoners were a number of priests, and Joan took these underher protection and saved their lives. It was urged that they were mostprobably combatants in disguise, but she said:
"As to that, how can any tell? They wear the livery of God, and if evenone of these wears it rightfully, surely it were better that all theguilty should escape than that we have upon our hands the blood of thatinnocent man. I will lodge them where I lodge, and feed them, and sentthem away in safety."
We marched back to the city with our crop of cannon and prisoners on viewand our banners displayed. Here was the first substantial bit of war-workthe imprisoned people had seen in the seven months that the siege hadendured, the first chance they had had to rejoice over a French exploit.You may guess that they made good use of it. They and the bells went mad.Joan was their darling now, and the press of people struggling andshouldering each other to get a glimpse of her was so great that we couldhardly push our way through the streets at all. Her new name had gone allabout, and was on everybody's lips. The Holy Maid of Vaucouleurs was aforgotten title; the city had claimed her for its own, and she was theMAID OF ORLEANS now. It is a happiness to me to remember that I heardthat name the first time it was ever uttered. Between that firstutterance and the last time it will be uttered on this earth--ah, thinkhow many moldering ages will lie in that gap!
The Boucher family welcomed her back as if she had been a child of thehouse, and saved from death against all hope or probability. They chidedher for going into the battle and exposing herself to danger during allthose hours. They could not realize that she had meant to carry herwarriorship so far, and asked her if it had really been her purpose to goright into the turmoil of the fight, or hadn't she got swept into it byaccident and the rush of the troops? They begged her to be more carefulanother time. It was good advice, maybe, but it fell upon prettyunfruitful soil.
