It is five months.  Or is it six?  My troubles have clouded mymemory.  I have been all over this land, from end to end, and now Iam back again since day before yesterday, to that city which wepassed through, that last day of our long journey, and which isnear her country home.  I am a tottering ruin and my eyes are dim,but I recognized it.  If she could see me she would know me andsound my call.  I wish I could hear it once more; it would reviveme, it would bring back her face and the mountains and the freelife, and I would come - if I were dying I would come!  She wouldnot know ME, looking as I do, but she would know me by my star.But she will never see me, for they do not let me out of thisshabby stable - a foul and miserable place, with most two wreckslike myself for company.
How many times have I changed hands?  I think it is twelve times -I cannot remember; and each time it was down a step lower, and eachtime I got a harder master.  They have been cruel, every one; theyhave worked me night and day in degraded employments, and beatenme; they have fed me ill, and some days not at all.  And so I ambut bones, now, with a rough and frowsy skin humped and corneredupon my shrunken body - that skin which was once so glossy, thatskin which she loved to stroke with her hand.  I was the pride ofthe mountains and the Great Plains; now I am a scarecrow anddespised.  These piteous wrecks that are my comrades here say wehave reached the bottom of the scale, the final humiliation; theysay that when a horse is no longer worth the weeds and discardedrubbish they feed to him, they sell him to the bull-ring for aglass of brandy, to make sport for the people and perish for theirpleasure.
To die - that does not disturb me; we of the service never care fordeath.  But if I could see her once more! if I could hear her buglesing again and say, "It is I, Soldier - come!"
