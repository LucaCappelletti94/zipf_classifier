The Betrayal
IN THE MORNING I was at my official post. It was on a platform raised theheight of a man, in the churchyard, under the eaves of St. Ouen. On thissame platform was a crowd of priests and important citizens, and severallawyers. Abreast it, with a small space between, was another and largerplatform, handsomely canopied against sun and rain, and richly carpeted;also it was furnished with comfortable chairs, and with two which weremore sumptuous than the others, and raised above the general level. Oneof these two was occupied by a prince of the royal blood of England, hisEminence the Cardinal of Winchester; the other by Cauchon, Bishop ofBeauvais. In the rest of the chairs sat three bishops, theVice-Inquisitor, eight abbots, and the sixty-two friars and lawyers whohad sat as Joan's judges in her late trials.
Twenty steps in front of the platforms was another--a table-toppedpyramid of stone, built up in retreating courses, thus forming steps. Outof this rose that grisly thing, the stake; about the stake bundles offagots and firewood were piled. On the ground at the base of the pyramidstood three crimson figures, the executioner and his assistants. At theirfeet lay what had been a goodly heap of brands, but was now a smokelessnest of ruddy coals; a foot or two from this was a supplemental supply ofwood and fagots compacted into a pile shoulder-high and containing asmuch as six packhorse loads. Think of that. We seem so delicately made,so destructible, so insubstantial; yet it is easier to reduce a granitestatue to ashes than it is to do that with a man's body.
The sight of the stake sent physical pains tingling down the nerves of mybody; and yet, turn as I would, my eyes would keep coming back t it, suchfascination has the gruesome and the terrible for us.
The space occupied by the platforms and the stake was kept open by a wallof English soldiery, standing elbow to elbow, erect and stalwart figures,fine and sightly in their polished steel; while from behind them on everyhand stretched far away a level plain of human heads; and there was nowindow and no housetop within our view, howsoever distant, but was blackwith patches and masses of people.
But there was no noise, no stir; it was as if the world was dead. Theimpressiveness of this silence and solemnity was deepened by a leadentwilight, for the sky was hidden by a pall of low-hanging storm-clouds;and above the remote horizon faint winkings of heat-lightning played, andnow and then one caught the dull mutterings and complainings of distantthunder.
At last the stillness was broken. From beyond the square rose anindistinct sound, but familiar--court, crisp phrases of command; next Isaw the plain of heads dividing, and the steady swing of a marching hostwas glimpsed between. My heart leaped for a moment. Was it La Hire andhis hellions? No--that was not their gait. No, it was the prisoner andher escort; it was Joan of Arc, under guard, that was coming; my spiritssank as low as they had been before. Weak as she was they made her walk;they would increase her weakness all they could. The distance was notgreat--it was but a few hundred yards--but short as it was it was a heavytax upon one who had been lying chained in one spot for months, and whosefeet had lost their powers from inaction. Yes, and for a year Joan hadknown only the cool damps of a dungeon, and now she was dragging herselfthrough this sultry summer heat, this airless and suffocating void. Asshe entered the gate, drooping with exhaustion, there was that creatureLoyseleur at her side with his head bent to her ear. We knew afterwardthat he had been with her again this morning in the prison wearying herwith his persuasions and enticing her with false promises, and that hewas now still at the same work at the gate, imploring her to yieldeverything that would be required of her, and assuring her that if shewould do this all would be well with her: she would be rid of the dreadedEnglish and find safety in the powerful shelter and protection of theChurch. A miserable man, a stony-hearted man!
The moment Joan was seated on the platform she closed her eyes andallowed her chin to fall; and so sat, with her hands nestling in her lap,indifferent to everything, caring for nothing but rest. And she was sowhite again--white as alabaster.
How the faces of that packed mass of humanity lighted up with interest,and with what intensity all eyes gazed upon this fragile girl! And hownatural it was; for these people realized that at last they were lookingupon that person whom they had so long hungered to see; a person whosename and fame filled all Europe, and made all other names and all otherrenowns insignificant by comparisons; Joan of Arc, the wonder of thetime, and destined to be the wonder of all times!
And I could read as by print, in their marveling countenances, the wordsthat were drifting through their minds: "Can it be true, is itbelievable, that it is this little creature, this girl, this child withthe good face, the sweet face, the beautiful face, the dear and bonnyface, that has carried fortresses by storm, charged at the head ofvictorious armies, blown the might of England out of her path with abreath, and fought a long campaign, solitary and alone, against themassed brains and learning of France--and had won it if the fight hadbeen fair!"
Evidently Cauchon had grown afraid of Manchon because of his prettyapparent leanings toward Joan, for another recorder was in the chiefplace here, which left my master and me nothing to do but sit idle andlook on.
Well, I suppose that everything had been done which could be thought ofto tire Joan's body and mind, but it was a mistake; one more device hadbeen invented. This was to preach a long sermon to her in that oppressiveheat.
When the preacher began, she cast up one distressed and disappointedlook, then dropped her head again. This preacher was Guillaume Erard, anoratorical celebrity. He got his text from the Twelve Lies. He emptiedupon Joan al the calumnies in detail that had been bottled up in thatmass of venom, and called her all the brutal names that the Twelve werelabeled with, working himself into a whirlwind of fury as he went on; buthis labors were wasted, she seemed lost in dreams, she made no sign, shedid not seem to hear. At last he launched this apostrophe:
"O France, how hast thou been abused! Thou hast always been the home ofChristianity; but now, Charles, who calls himself thy King and governor,indorses, like the heretic and schismatic that he is, the words and deedsof a worthless and infamous woman!" Joan raised her head, and her eyesbegan to burn and flash. The preacher turned to her: "It is to you, Joan,that I speak, and I tell you that your King is schismatic and a heretic!"
Ah, he might abuse her to his heart's content; she could endure that; butto her dying moment she could never hear in patience a word against thatingrate, that treacherous dog our King, whose proper place was here, atthis moment, sword in hand, routing these reptiles and saving this mostnoble servant that ever King had in this world--and he would have beenthere if he had not been what I have called him. Joan's loyal soul wasoutraged, and she turned upon the preacher and flung out a few words witha spirit which the crowd recognized as being in accordance with the Joanof Arc traditions:
"By my faith, sir! I make bold to say and swear, on pain of death, thathe is the most noble Christian of all Christians, and the best lover ofthe faith and the Church!"
There was an explosion of applause from the crowd--which angered thepreacher, for he had been aching long to hear an expression like this,and now that it was come at last it had fallen to the wrong person: hehad done all the work; the other had carried off all the spoil. Hestamped his foot and shouted to the sheriff:
"Make her shut up!"
That made the crowd laugh.
A mob has small respect for a grown man who has to call on a sheriff toprotect him from a sick girl.
Joan had damaged the preacher's cause more with one sentence than he hadhelped it with a hundred; so he was much put out, and had trouble to geta good start again. But he needn't have bothered; thee was no occasion.It was mainly an English-feeling mob. It had but obeyed a law of ournature--an irresistible law--to enjoy and applaud a spirited and promptlydelivered retort, no matter who makes it. The mob was with the preacher;it had been beguiled for a moment, but only that; it would soon return.It was there to see this girl burnt; so that it got thatsatisfaction--without too much delay--it would be content.
Presently the preacher formally summoned Joan to submit to the Church. Hemade the demand with confidence, for he had gotten the idea fromLoyseleur and Beaupere that she was worn to the bone, exhausted, andwould not be able to put forth any more resistance; and, indeed, to lookat her it seemed that they must be right. Nevertheless, she made one moreeffort to hold her ground, and said, wearily:
"As to that matter, I have answered my judges before. I have told them toreport all that I have said and done to our Holy Father the Pope--towhom, and to God first, I appeal."
Again, out of her native wisdom, she had brought those words oftremendous import, but was ignorant of their value. But they could haveavailed her nothing in any case, now, with the stake there and thesethousands of enemies about her. Yet they made every churchman thereblench, and the preacher changed the subject with all haste. Well mightthose criminals blench, for Joan's appeal of her case to the Popestripped Cauchon at once of jurisdiction over it, and annulled all thathe and his judges had already done in the matter and all that they shoulddo in it henceforth.
Joan went on presently to reiterate, after some further talk, that shehad acted by command of God in her deeds and utterances; then, when anattempt was made to implicate the King, and friends of hers and his, shestopped that. She said:
"I charge my deeds and words upon no one, neither upon my King nor anyother. If there is any fault in them, I am responsible and no other."
She was asked if she would not recant those of her words and deeds whichhad been pronounced evil by her judges. Here answer made confusion anddamage again:
"I submit them to God and the Pope."
The Pope once more! It was very embarrassing. Here was a person who wasasked to submit her case to the Church, and who frankly consents--offersto submit it to the very head of it. What more could any one require? Howwas one to answer such a formidably unanswerable answer as that?
The worried judges put their heads together and whispered and planned anddiscussed. Then they brought forth this sufficiently shamblingconclusion--but it was the best they could do, in so close a place: theysaid the Pope was so far away; and it was not necessary to go to himanyway, because the present judges had sufficient power and authority todeal with the present case, and were in effect "the Church" to thatextent. At another time they could have smiled at this conceit, but notnow; they were not comfortable enough now.
The mob was getting impatient. It was beginning to put on a threateningaspect; it was tired of standing, tired of the scorching heat; and thethunder was coming nearer, the lightning was flashing brighter. It wasnecessary to hurry this matter to a close. Erard showed Joan a writtenform, which had been prepared and made all ready beforehand, and askedher to abjure.
"Abjure? What is abjure?"
She did not know the word. It was explained to her by Massieu. She triedto understand, but she was breaking, under exhaustion, and she could notgather the meaning. It was all a jumble and confusion of strange words.In her despair she sent out this beseeching cry:
"I appeal to the Church universal whether I ought to abjure or not!"
Erard exclaimed:
"You shall abjure instantly, or instantly be burnt!"
She glanced up, at those awful words, and for the first time she saw thestake and the mass of red coals--redder and angrier than ever now underthe constantly deepening storm-gloom. She gasped and staggered up out ofher seat muttering and mumbling incoherently, and gazed vacantly upon thepeople and the scene about her like one who is dazed, or thinks hedreams, and does not know where he is.
The priests crowded about her imploring her to sign the paper, there weremany voices beseeching and urging her at once, there was great turmoiland shouting and excitement among the populace and everywhere.
"Sign! sign!" from the priests; "sign--sign and be saved!" And Loyseleurwas urging at her ear, "Do as I told you--do not destroy yourself!"
Joan said plaintively to these people:
"Ah, you do not do well to seduce me."
The judges joined their voices to the others. Yes, even the iron in theirhearts melted, and they said:
"O Joan, we pity you so! Take back what you have said, or we must deliveryou up to punishment."
And now there was another voice--it was from the other platform--pealingsolemnly above the din: Cauchon's--reading the sentence of death!
Joan's strength was all spent. She stood looking about her in abewildered way a moment, then slowly she sank to her knees, and bowed herhead and said:
"I submit."
They gave her no time to reconsider--they knew the peril of that. Themoment the words were out of her mouth Massieu was reading to her theabjuration, and she was repeating the words after him mechanically,unconsciously--and smiling; for her wandering mind was far away in somehappier world.
Then this short paper of six lines was slipped aside and a long one ofmany pages was smuggled into its place, and she, noting nothing, put hermark on it, saying, in pathetic apology, that she did not know how towrite. But a secretary of the King of England was there to take care ofthat defect; he guided her hand with his own, and wrote hername--Jehanne.
The great crime was accomplished. She had signed--what? She did notknow--but the others knew. She had signed a paper confessing herself asorceress, a dealer with devils, a liar, a blasphermer of God and Hisangels, a lover of blood, a promoter of sedition, cruel, wicked,commissioned of Satan; and this signature of hers bound her to resume thedress of a woman.
There were other promises, but that one would answer, without the others;and that one could be made to destroy her.
Loyseleur pressed forward and praised her for having done "such a goodday's work."
But she was still dreamy, she hardly heard.
Then Cauchon pronounced the words which dissolved the excommunication andrestored her to her beloved Church, with all the dear privileges ofworship. Ah, she heard that! You could see it in the deep gratitude thatrose in her face and transfigured it with joy.
But how transient was that happiness! For Cauchon, without a tremor ofpity in his voice, added these crushing words:
"And that she may repent of her crimes and repeat them no more, she issentenced to perpetual imprisonment, with the bread of affliction and thewater of anguish!"
Perpetual imprisonment! She had never dreamed of that--such a thing hadnever been hinted to her by Loyseleur or by any other. Loyseleur haddistinctly said and promised that "all would be well with her." And thevery last words spoken to her by Erard, on that very platform, when hewas urging her to abjure, was a straight, unqualified promised--that ifshe would do it she should go free from captivity.
She stood stunned and speechless a moment; then she remembered, with suchsolacement as the thought could furnish, that by another clear promisemade by Cauchon himself--she would at least be the Church's captive, andhave women about her in place of a brutal foreign soldiery. So she turnedto the body of priests and said, with a sad resignation:
"Now, you men of the Church, take me to your prison, and leave me nolonger in the hands of the English"; and she gathered up her chains andprepared to move.
But alas! now came these shameful words from Cauchon--and with them amocking laugh:
"Take her to the prison whence she came!"
Poor abused girl! She stood dumb, smitten, paralyzed. It was pitiful tosee. She had been beguiled, lied to, betrayed; she saw it all now.
The rumbling of a drum broke upon the stillness, and for just one momentshe thought of the glorious deliverance promised by her Voices--I read itin the rapture that lit her face; then she saw what it was--her prisonescort--and that light faded, never to revive again. And now her headbegan a piteous rocking motion, swaying slowly, this way and that, as isthe way when one is suffering unwordable pain, or when one's heart isbroken; then drearily she went from us, with her face in her hands, andsobbing bitterly.
