When we consider the immensity of the British Empire in territory,population, and trade, it requires a stern exercise of faith to believein the figures which represent Australasia's contribution to the Empire'scommercial grandeur. As compared with the landed estate of the BritishEmpire, the landed estate dominated by any other Power except one--Russia--is not very impressive for size. My authorities make the BritishEmpire not much short of a fourth larger than the Russian Empire.Roughly proportioned, if you will allow your entire hand to represent theBritish Empire, you may then cut off the fingers a trifle above themiddle joint of the middle finger, and what is left of the hand willrepresent Russia. The populations ruled by Great Britain and China areabout the same--400,000,000 each. No other Power approaches thesefigures. Even Russia is left far behind.
The population of Australasia--4,000,000--sinks into nothingness, and islost from sight in that British ocean of 400,000,000. Yet the statisticsindicate that it rises again and shows up very conspicuously when itsshare of the Empire's commerce is the matter under consideration. Thevalue of England's annual exports and imports is stated at three billionsof dollars,--[New South Wales Blue Book.]--and it is claimed that morethan one-tenth of this great aggregate is represented by Australasia'sexports to England and imports from England. In addition to this,Australasia does a trade with countries other than England, amounting toa hundred million dollars a year, and a domestic intercolonial tradeamounting to a hundred and fifty millions.
In round numbers the 4,000,000 buy and sell about $600,000,000 worth ofgoods a year. It is claimed that about half of this representscommodities of Australasian production. The products exported annuallyby India are worth a trifle over $500,000,000. Now, here are somefaith-straining figures:
Indian production (300,000,000 population), $500,000,000.
Australasian production (4,000,000 population), $300,000,000.
That is to say, the product of the individual Indian, annually (forexport some whither), is worth $1.15; that of the individualAustralasian (for export some whither), $75! Or, to put it in anotherway, the Indian family of man and wife and three children sends away anannual result worth $8.75, while the Australasian family sends away $375worth.
There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard Temple andothers, which show that the individual Indian's whole annual product,both for export and home use, is worth in gold only $7.50; or, $37.50for the family-aggregate. Ciphered out on a like ratio ofmultiplication, the Australasian family's aggregate production would benearly $1,600. Truly, nothing is so astonishing as figures, if they onceget started.
We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide, the capital of the vast Provinceof South Australia--a seventeen-hour excursion. On the train we foundseveral Sydney friends; among them a Judge who was going out on circuit,and was going to hold court at Broken Hill, where the celebrated silvermine is. It seemed a curious road to take to get to that region. BrokenHill is close to the western border of New South Wales, and Sydney is onthe eastern border. A fairly straight line, 700 miles long, drawnwestward from Sydney, would strike Broken Hill, just as a somewhatshorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo. The way theJudge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by rail, he said;southwest from Sydney down to Melbourne, then northward up to Adelaide,then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New South Walesonce more--to Broken Hill. It was like going from Boston southwest toRichmond, Virginia, then northwest up to Erie, Pennsylvania, then a cantback northeast and over the border--to Buffalo, New York.
But the explanation was simple. Years ago the fabulously rich silverdiscovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an unexpectant world. Itsstocks started at shillings, and went by leaps and bounds to the mostfanciful figures. It was one of those cases where the cook puts amonth's wages into shares, and comes next mouth and buys your house atyour own price, and moves into it herself; where the coachman takes a fewshares, and next month sets up a bank; and where the common sailorinvests the price of a spree, and next month buys out the steamshipcompany and goes into business on his own hook. In a word, it was one ofthose excitements which bring multitudes of people to a common centerwith a rush, and whose needs must be supplied, and at once. Adelaide wasclose by, Sydney was far away. Adelaide threw a short railway across theborder before Sydney had time to arrange for a long one; it was not worthwhile for Sydney to arrange at all. The whole vast trade-profit ofBroken Hill fell into Adelaide's hands, irrevocably. New South Walesfurnishes for Broken Hill and sends her Judges 2,000 miles--mainlythrough alien countries--to administer it, but Adelaide takes thedividends and makes no moan.
We started at 4.20 in the afternoon, and moved across level until night.In the morning we had a stretch of "scrub" country--the kind of thingwhich is so useful to the Australian novelist. In the scrub the hostileaboriginal lurks, and flits mysteriously about, slipping out from time totime to surprise and slaughter the settler; then slipping back again, andleaving no track that the white man can follow. In the scrub thenovelist's heroine gets lost, search fails of result; she wanders hereand there, and finally sinks down exhausted and unconscious, and thesearchers pass within a yard or two of her, not suspecting that she isnear, and by and by some rambler finds her bones and the pathetic diarywhich she had scribbled with her failing hand and left behind. Nobodycan find a lost heroine in the scrub but the aboriginal "tracker," and hewill not lend himself to the scheme if it will interfere with thenovelist's plot. The scrub stretches miles and miles in all directions,and looks like a level roof of bush-tops without a break or a crack in it--as seamless as a blanket, to all appearance. One might as well walkunder water and hope to guess out a route and stick to it, I shouldthink. Yet it is claimed that the aboriginal "tracker" was able to huntout people lost in the scrub. Also in the "bush"; also in the desert;and even follow them over patches of bare rocks and over alluvial groundwhich had to all appearance been washed clear of footprints.
From reading Australian books and talking with the people, I becameconvinced that the aboriginal tracker's performances evince a craft, apenetration, a luminous sagacity, and a minuteness and accuracy ofobservation in the matter of detective-work not found in nearly soremarkable a degree in any other people, white or colored. In anofficial account of the blacks of Australia published by the governmentof Victoria, one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the faintmarks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing opossum, butknows in some way or other whether the marks were made to-day oryesterday.
And there is the case, on records where A., a settler, makes a bet withB., that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can, and A. will producean aboriginal who will find her. B. selects a cow and lets the trackersee the cow's footprint, then be put under guard. B. then drives the cowa few miles over a course which drifts in all directions, and frequentlydoubles back upon itself; and he selects difficult ground all the time,and once or twice even drives the cow through herds of other cows, andmingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs. He finally bringshis cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, and at once moves aroundin a great circle, examining all cow-tracks until he finds the one he isafter; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic course, andultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the cow. Nowwherein does one cow-track differ from another? There must be adifference, or the tracker could not have performed the feat; adifference minute, shadowy, and not detectible by you or me, or by thelate Sherlock Holmes, and yet discernible by a member of a race chargedby some people with occupying the bottom place in the gradations of humanintelligence.
