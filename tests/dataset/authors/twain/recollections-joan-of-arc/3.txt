All Aflame with Love of France
SPEAKING of this matter reminds me of many incidents, many things that Icould tell, but I think I will not try to do it now. It will be more tomy present humor to call back a little glimpse of the simple andcolorless good times we used to have in our village homes in thosepeaceful days--especially in the winter. In the summer we children wereout on the breezy uplands with the flocks from dawn till night, and thenthere was noisy frolicking and all that; but winter was the cozy time,winter was the snug time. Often we gathered in old Jacques d'Arc's bigdirt-floored apartment, with a great fire going, and played games, andsang songs, and told fortunes, and listened to the old villagers telltales and histories and lies and one thing and another till twelveo'clock at night.
One winter's night we were gathered there--it was the winter that foryears afterward they called the hard winter--and that particular nightwas a sharp one. It blew a gale outside, and the screaming of the windwas a stirring sound, and I think I may say it was beautiful, for I thinkit is great and fine and beautiful to hear the wind rage and storm andblow its clarions like that, when you are inside and comfortable. And wewere. We had a roaring fire, and the pleasant spit-spit of the snow andsleet falling in it down the chimney, and the yarning and laughing andsinging went on at a noble rate till about ten o'clock, and then we had asupper of hot porridge and beans, and meal cakes with butter, andappetites to match.
Little Joan sat on a box apart, and had her bowl and bread on anotherone, and her pets around her helping. She had more than was usual of themor economical, because all the outcast cats came and took up with her,and homeless or unlovable animals of other kinds heard about it and came,and these spread the matter to the other creatures, and they came also;and as the birds and the other timid wild things of the woods were notafraid of her, but always had an idea she was a friend when they cameacross her, and generally struck up an acquaintance with her to getinvited to the house, she always had samples of those breeds in stock.She was hospitable to them all, for an animal was an animal to her, anddear by mere reason of being an animal, no matter about its sort orsocial station; and as she would allow of no cages, no collars, nofetters, but left the creatures free to come and go as they liked, thatcontented them, and they came; but they didn't go, to any extent, and sothey were a marvelous nuisance, and made Jacques d'Arc swear a good deal;but his wife said God gave the child the instinct, and knew what He wasdoing when He did it, therefore it must have its course; it would be nosound prudence to meddle with His affairs when no invitation had beenextended. So the pets were left in peace, and here they were, as I havesaid, rabbits, birds, squirrels, cats, and other reptiles, all around thechild, and full of interest in her supper, and helping what they could.There was a very small squirrel on her shoulder, sitting up, as thosecreatures do, and turning a rocky fragment of prehistoric chestnut-cakeover and over in its knotty hands, and hunting for the less induratedplaces, and giving its elevated bushy tail a flirt and its pointed ears atoss when it found one--signifying thankfulness and surprise--and then itfiled that place off with those two slender front teeth which a squirrelcarries for that purpose and not for ornament, for ornamental they nevercould be, as any will admit that have noticed them.
Everything was going fine and breezy and hilarious, but then there camean interruption, for somebody hammered on the door. It was one of thoseragged road-stragglers--the eternal wars kept the country full of them.He came in, all over snow, and stamped his feet, and shook, and brushedhimself, and shut the door, and took off his limp ruin of a hat, andslapped it once or twice against his leg to knock off its fleece of snow,and then glanced around on the company with a pleased look upon his thinface, and a most yearning and famished one in his eye when it fell uponthe victuals, and then he gave us a humble and conciliatory salutation,and said it was a blessed thing to have a fire like that on such a night,and a roof overhead like this, and that rich food to eat, and lovingfriends to talk with--ah, yes, this was true, and God help the homeless,and such as must trudge the roads in this weather.
Nobody said anything. The embarrassed poor creature stood there andappealed to one face after the other with his eyes, and found no welcomein any, the smile on his own face flickering and fading and perishing,meanwhile; then he dropped his gaze, the muscles of his face began totwitch, and he put up his hand to cover this womanish sign of weakness.
"Sit down!"
This thunder-blast was from old Jacques d'Arc, and Joan was the object ofit. The stranger was startled, and took his hand away, and there was Joanstanding before him offering him her bowl of porridge. The man said:
"God Almighty bless you, my darling!" and then the tears came, and randown his cheeks, but he was afraid to take the bowl.
"Do you hear me? Sit down, I say!"
There could not be a child more easy to persuade than Joan, but this wasnot the way. Her father had not the art; neither could he learn it. Joansaid:
"Father, he is hungry; I can see it."
"Let him work for food, then. We are being eaten out of house and home byhis like, and I have said I would endure it no more, and will keep myword. He has the face of a rascal anyhow, and a villain. Sit down, I tellyou!"
"I know not if he is a rascal or no, but he is hungry, father, and shallhave my porridge--I do not need it."
"If you don't obey me I'll-- Rascals are not entitled to help from honestpeople, and no bite nor sup shall they have in this house. Joan!"
She set her bowl down on the box and came over and stood before herscowling father, and said:
"Father, if you will not let me, then it must be as you say; but I wouldthat you would think--then you would see that it is not right to punishone part of him for what the other part has done; for it is that poorstranger's head that does the evil things, but it is not his head that ishungry, it is his stomach, and it has done no harm to anybody, but iswithout blame, and innocent, not having any way to do a wrong, even if itwas minded to it. Please let--"
"What an idea! It is the most idiotic speech I ever heard."
But Aubrey, the maire, broke in, he being fond of an argument, and havinga pretty gift in that regard, as all acknowledged. Rising in his placeand leaning his knuckles upon the table and looking about him with easydignity, after the manner of such as be orators, he began, smooth andpersuasive:
"I will differ with you there, gossip, and will undertake to show thecompany"--here he looked around upon us and nodded his head in aconfident way--"that there is a grain of sense in what the child hassaid; for look you, it is of a certainty most true and demonstrable thatit is a man's head that is master and supreme ruler over his whole body.Is that granted? Will any deny it?" He glanced around again; everybodyindicated assent. "Very well, then; that being the case, no part of thebody is responsible for the result when it carries out an order deliveredto it by the head; ergo, the head is alone responsible for crimes done bya man's hands or feet or stomach--do you get the idea? am I right thusfar?" Everybody said yes, and said it with enthusiasm, and some said, oneto another, that the maire was in great form to-night and at his verybest--which pleased the maire exceedingly and made his eyes sparkle withpleasure, for he overheard these things; so he went on in the samefertile and brilliant way. "Now, then, we will consider what the termresponsibility means, and how it affects the case in point.Responsibility makes a man responsible for only those things for which heis properly responsible"--and he waved his spoon around in a wide sweepto indicate the comprehensive nature of that class of responsibilitieswhich render people responsible, and several exclaimed, admiringly, "Heis right!--he has put that whole tangled thing into a nutshell--it iswonderful!" After a little pause to give the interest opportunity togather and grow, he went on: "Very good. Let us suppose the case of apair of tongs that falls upon a man's foot, causing a cruel hurt. Willyou claim that the tongs are punishable for that? The question isanswered; I see by your faces that you would call such a claim absurd.Now, why is it absurd? It is absurd because, there being no reasoningfaculty--that is to say, no faculty of personal command--in a pair oftogs, personal responsibility for the acts of the tongs is wholly absentfrom the tongs; and, therefore, responsibility being absent, punishmentcannot ensue. Am I right?" A hearty burst of applause was his answer."Now, then, we arrive at a man's stomach. Consider how exactly, howmarvelously, indeed, its situation corresponds to that of a pair oftongs. Listen--and take careful note, I beg you. Can a man's stomach plana murder? No. Can it plan a theft? No. Can it plan an incendiary fire?No. Now answer me--can a pair of tongs?" (There were admiring shouts of"No!" and "The cases are just exact!" and "Don't he do it splendid!")"Now, then, friends and neighbors, a stomach which cannot plan a crimecannot be a principal in the commission of it--that is plain, as you see.The matter is narrowed down by that much; we will narrow it further. Cana stomach, of its own motion, assist at a crime? The answer is no,because command is absent, the reasoning faculty is absent, volition isabsent--as in the case of the tongs. We perceive now, do we not, that thestomach is totally irresponsible for crimes committed, either in whole orin part, by it?" He got a rousing cheer for response. "Then what do wearrive at as our verdict? Clearly this: that there is no such thing inthis world as a guilty stomach; that in the body of the veriest rascalresides a pure and innocent stomach; that, whatever it's owner may do, itat least should be sacred in our eyes; and that while God gives us mindsto think just and charitable and honorable thoughts, it should be, andis, our privilege, as well as our duty, not only to feed the hungrystomach that resides in a rascal, having pity for its sorrow and itsneed, but to do it gladly, gratefully, in recognition of its sturdy andloyal maintenance of its purity and innocence in the midst of temptationand in company so repugnant to its better feelings. I am done."
Well, you never saw such an effect! They rose--the whole house rose--anclapped, and cheered, and praised him to the skies; and one afteranother, still clapping and shouting, they crowded forward, some withmoisture in their eyes, and wrung his hands, and said such gloriousthings to him that he was clear overcome with pride and happiness, andcouldn't say a word, for his voice would have broken, sure. It wassplendid to see; and everybody said he had never come up to that speechin his life before, and never could do it again. Eloquence is a power,there is no question of that. Even old Jacques d'Arc was carried away,for once in his life, and shouted out:
"It's all right, Joan--give him the porridge!"
She was embarrassed, and did not seem to know what to say, and so didn'tsay anything. It was because she had given the man the porridge long agoand he had already eaten it all up. When she was asked why she had notwaited until a decision was arrived at, she said the man's stomach wasvery hungry, and it would not have been wise to wait, since she could nottell what the decision would be. Now that was a good and thoughtful ideafor a child.
The man was not a rascal at all. He was a very good fellow, only he wasout of luck, and surely that was no crime at that time in France. Nowthat his stomach was proved to be innocent, it was allowed to make itselfat home; and as soon as it was well filled and needed nothing more, theman unwound his tongue and turned it loose, and it was really a noble oneto go. He had been in the wars for years, and the things he told and theway he told them fired everybody's patriotism away up high, and set allhearts to thumping and all pulses to leaping; then, before anybodyrightly knew how the change was made, he was leading us a sublime marchthrough the ancient glories of France, and in fancy we saw the titanicforms of the twelve paladins rise out of the mists of the past and facetheir fate; we heard the tread of the innumerable hosts sweeping down toshut them in; we saw this human tide flow and ebb, ebb and flow, andwaste away before that little band of heroes; we saw each detail passbefore us of that most stupendous, most disastrous, yet most adored andglorious day in French legendary history; here and there and yonder,across that vast field of the dead and dying, we saw this and that andthe other paladin dealing his prodigious blows with weary arm and failingstrength, and one by one we saw them fall, till only one remained--hethat was without peer, he whose name gives name to the Song of Songs, thesong which no Frenchman can hear and keep his feelings down and his prideof country cool; then, grandest and pitifulest scene of all, we saw hisown pathetic death; and out stillness, as we sat with parted lips andbreathless, hanging upon this man's words, gave us a sense of the awfulstillness that reigned in that field of slaughter when that lastsurviving soul had passed.
And now, in this solemn hush, the stranger gave Joan a pat or two on thehead and said:
"Little maid--whom God keep!--you have brought me from death to life thisnight; now listen: here is your reward," and at that supreme time forsuch a heart-melting, soul-rousing surprise, without another word helifted up the most noble and pathetic voice that was ever heard, andbegan to pour out the great Song of Roland!
Think of that, with a French audience all stirred up and ready. Oh, wherewas your spoken eloquence now! what was it to this! How fine he looked,how stately, how inspired, as he stood there with that mighty chantwelling from his lips and his heart, his whole body transfigured, and hisrags along with it.
Everybody rose and stood while he sang, and their faces glowed and theireyes burned; and the tears came and flowed don their cheeks and theirforms began to sway unconsciously to the swing of the song, and theirbosoms to heave and pant; and moanings broke out, and deep ejaculations;and when the last verse was reached, and Roland lay dying, all alone,with his face to the field and to his slain, lying there in heaps andwinrows, and took off and held up his gauntlet to God with his failinghand, and breathed his beautiful prayer with his paling pips, all burstout in sobs and wailings. But when the final great note died out and thesong was done, they all flung themselves in a body at the singer, starkmad with love of him and love of France and pride in her great deeds andold renown, and smothered him with their embracings; but Joan was therefirst, hugged close to his breast, and covering his face with idolatrouskisses.
The storm raged on outside, but that was no matter; this was thestranger's home now, for as long as he might please.
