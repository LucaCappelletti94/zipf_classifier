We plowed along bravely for a week or more, and without any conflict ofjurisdiction among the captains worth mentioning. The passengers soonlearned to accommodate themselves to their new circumstances, and life inthe ship became nearly as systematically monotonous as the routine of abarrack. I do not mean that it was dull, for it was not entirely so byany means--but there was a good deal of sameness about it. As is alwaysthe fashion at sea, the passengers shortly began to pick up sailor terms--a sign that they were beginning to feel at home. Half-past six was nolonger half-past six to these pilgrims from New England, the South, andthe Mississippi Valley, it was "seven bells"; eight, twelve, and fouro'clock were "eight bells"; the captain did not take the longitude atnine o'clock, but at "two bells." They spoke glibly of the "aftercabin," the "for'rard cabin," "port and starboard" and the "fo'castle."
At seven bells the first gong rang; at eight there was breakfast, forsuch as were not too seasick to eat it. After that all the well peoplewalked arm-in-arm up and down the long promenade deck, enjoying the finesummer mornings, and the seasick ones crawled out and propped themselvesup in the lee of the paddle-boxes and ate their dismal tea and toast, andlooked wretched. From eleven o'clock until luncheon, and from luncheonuntil dinner at six in the evening, the employments and amusements werevarious. Some reading was done, and much smoking and sewing, though notby the same parties; there were the monsters of the deep to be lookedafter and wondered at; strange ships had to be scrutinized throughopera-glasses, and sage decisions arrived at concerning them; and morethan that, everybody took a personal interest in seeing that the flag wasrun up and politely dipped three times in response to the salutes ofthose strangers; in the smoking room there were always parties ofgentlemen playing euchre, draughts and dominoes, especially dominoes,that delightfully harmless game; and down on the main deck, "for'rard"--for'rard of the chicken-coops and the cattle--we had what was called"horse billiards." Horse billiards is a fine game. It affords good,active exercise, hilarity, and consuming excitement. It is a mixture of"hop-scotch" and shuffleboard played with a crutch. A large hop-scotchdiagram is marked out on the deck with chalk, and each compartmentnumbered. You stand off three or four steps, with some broad woodendisks before you on the deck, and these you send forward with a vigorousthrust of a long crutch. If a disk stops on a chalk line, it does notcount anything. If it stops in division No. 7, it counts 7; in 5, itcounts 5, and so on. The game is 100, and four can play at a time. Thatgame would be very simple played on a stationary floor, but with us, toplay it well required science. We had to allow for the reeling of theship to the right or the left. Very often one made calculations for aheel to the right and the ship did not go that way. The consequence wasthat that disk missed the whole hopscotch plan a yard or two, and thenthere was humiliation on one side and laughter on the other.
When it rained the passengers had to stay in the house, of course--or atleast the cabins--and amuse themselves with games, reading, looking outof the windows at the very familiar billows, and talking gossip.
By 7 o'clock in the evening, dinner was about over; an hour's promenadeon the upper deck followed; then the gong sounded and a large majority ofthe party repaired to the after cabin (upper), a handsome saloon fifty orsixty feet long, for prayers. The unregenerated called this saloon the"Synagogue." The devotions consisted only of two hymns from the PlymouthCollection and a short prayer, and seldom occupied more than fifteenminutes. The hymns were accompanied by parlor-organ music when the seawas smooth enough to allow a performer to sit at the instrument withoutbeing lashed to his chair.
After prayers the Synagogue shortly took the semblance of a writingschool. The like of that picture was never seen in a ship before.Behind the long dining tables on either side of the saloon, and scatteredfrom one end to the other of the latter, some twenty or thirty gentlemenand ladies sat them down under the swaying lamps and for two or threehours wrote diligently in their journals. Alas! that journals sovoluminously begun should come to so lame and impotent a conclusion asmost of them did! I doubt if there is a single pilgrim of all that hostbut can show a hundred fair pages of journal concerning the first twentydays' voyaging in the Quaker City, and I am morally certain that not tenof the party can show twenty pages of journal for the succeeding twentythousand miles of voyaging! At certain periods it becomes the dearestambition of a man to keep a faithful record of his performances in abook; and he dashes at this work with an enthusiasm that imposes on himthe notion that keeping a journal is the veriest pastime in the world,and the pleasantest. But if he only lives twenty-one days, he will findout that only those rare natures that are made up of pluck, endurance,devotion to duty for duty's sake, and invincible determination may hopeto venture upon so tremendous an enterprise as the keeping of a journaland not sustain a shameful defeat.
One of our favorite youths, Jack, a splendid young fellow with a headfull of good sense, and a pair of legs that were a wonder to look upon inthe way of length and straightness and slimness, used to report progressevery morning in the most glowing and spirited way, and say:
"Oh, I'm coming along bully!" (he was a little given to slang in hishappier moods.) "I wrote ten pages in my journal last night--and youknow I wrote nine the night before and twelve the night before that.Why, it's only fun!"
"What do you find to put in it, Jack?"
"Oh, everything. Latitude and longitude, noon every day; and how manymiles we made last twenty-four hours; and all the domino games I beat andhorse billiards; and whales and sharks and porpoises; and the text of thesermon Sundays (because that'll tell at home, you know); and the ships wesaluted and what nation they were; and which way the wind was, andwhether there was a heavy sea, and what sail we carried, though we don'tever carry any, principally, going against a head wind always--wonderwhat is the reason of that?--and how many lies Moult has told--Oh, everything! I've got everything down. My father told me to keep thatjournal. Father wouldn't take a thousand dollars for it when I get itdone."
"No, Jack; it will be worth more than a thousand dollars--when you get itdone."
"Do you?--no, but do you think it will, though?
"Yes, it will be worth at least as much as a thousand dollars--when youget it done. May be more."
"Well, I about half think so, myself. It ain't no slouch of a journal."
But it shortly became a most lamentable "slouch of a journal." One nightin Paris, after a hard day's toil in sightseeing, I said:
"Now I'll go and stroll around the cafes awhile, Jack, and give you achance to write up your journal, old fellow."
His countenance lost its fire. He said:
"Well, no, you needn't mind. I think I won't run that journal anymore.It is awful tedious. Do you know--I reckon I'm as much as four thousandpages behind hand. I haven't got any France in it at all. First Ithought I'd leave France out and start fresh. But that wouldn't do,would it? The governor would say, 'Hello, here--didn't see anything inFrance? That cat wouldn't fight, you know. First I thought I'd copyFrance out of the guide-book, like old Badger in the for'rard cabin,who's writing a book, but there's more than three hundred pages of it.Oh, I don't think a journal's any use--do you? They're only a bother,ain't they?"
"Yes, a journal that is incomplete isn't of much use, but a journalproperly kept is worth a thousand dollars--when you've got it done."
"A thousand!--well, I should think so. I wouldn't finish it for amillion."
His experience was only the experience of the majority of thatindustrious night school in the cabin. If you wish to inflict aheartless and malignant punishment upon a young person, pledge him tokeep a journal a year.
A good many expedients were resorted to to keep the excursionists amusedand satisfied. A club was formed, of all the passengers, which met inthe writing school after prayers and read aloud about the countries wewere approaching and discussed the information so obtained.
Several times the photographer of the expedition brought out histransparent pictures and gave us a handsome magic-lantern exhibition.His views were nearly all of foreign scenes, but there were one or twohome pictures among them. He advertised that he would "open hisperformance in the after cabin at 'two bells' (nine P.M.) and show thepassengers where they shall eventually arrive"--which was all very well,but by a funny accident the first picture that flamed out upon the canvaswas a view of Greenwood Cemetery!
On several starlight nights we danced on the upper deck, under theawnings, and made something of a ball-room display of brilliancy byhanging a number of ship's lanterns to the stanchions. Our musicconsisted of the well-mixed strains of a melodeon which was a littleasthmatic and apt to catch its breath where it ought to come out strong,a clarinet which was a little unreliable on the high keys and rathermelancholy on the low ones, and a disreputable accordion that had a leaksomewhere and breathed louder than it squawked--a more elegant term doesnot occur to me just now. However, the dancing was infinitely worse thanthe music. When the ship rolled to starboard the whole platoon ofdancers came charging down to starboard with it, and brought up in massat the rail; and when it rolled to port they went floundering down toport with the same unanimity of sentiment. Waltzers spun aroundprecariously for a matter of fifteen seconds and then went scurrying downto the rail as if they meant to go overboard. The Virginia reel, asperformed on board the Quaker City, had more genuine reel about it thanany reel I ever saw before, and was as full of interest to the spectatoras it was full of desperate chances and hairbreadth escapes to theparticipant. We gave up dancing, finally.
We celebrated a lady's birthday anniversary with toasts, speeches, apoem, and so forth. We also had a mock trial. No ship ever went to seathat hadn't a mock trial on board. The purser was accused of stealing anovercoat from stateroom No. 10. A judge was appointed; also clerks, acrier of the court, constables, sheriffs; counsel for the State and forthe defendant; witnesses were subpoenaed, and a jury empaneled after muchchallenging. The witnesses were stupid and unreliable and contradictory,as witnesses always are. The counsel were eloquent, argumentative, andvindictively abusive of each other, as was characteristic and proper.The case was at last submitted and duly finished by the judge with anabsurd decision and a ridiculous sentence.
The acting of charades was tried on several evenings by the younggentlemen and ladies, in the cabins, and proved the most distinguishedsuccess of all the amusement experiments.
An attempt was made to organize a debating club, but it was a failure.There was no oratorical talent in the ship.
We all enjoyed ourselves--I think I can safely say that, but it was in arather quiet way. We very, very seldom played the piano; we played theflute and the clarinet together, and made good music, too, what there wasof it, but we always played the same old tune; it was a very pretty tune--how well I remember it--I wonder when I shall ever get rid of it. Wenever played either the melodeon or the organ except at devotions--but Iam too fast: young Albert did know part of a tune something about"O Something-Or-Other How Sweet It Is to Know That He's HisWhat's-his-Name" (I do not remember the exact title of it, but it wasvery plaintive and full of sentiment); Albert played that pretty muchall the time until we contracted with him to restrain himself. Butnobody ever sang by moonlight on the upper deck, and the congregationalsinging at church and prayers was not of a superior order ofarchitecture. I put up with it as long as I could and then joined inand tried to improve it, but this encouraged young George to join intoo, and that made a failure of it; because George's voice was just"turning," and when he was singing a dismal sort of bass it was apt tofly off the handle and startle everybody with a most discordant cackleon the upper notes. George didn't know the tunes, either, which wasalso a drawback to his performances. I said:
"Come, now, George, don't improvise. It looks too egotistical. It willprovoke remark. Just stick to 'Coronation,' like the others. It is agood tune--you can't improve it any, just off-hand, in this way."
"Why, I'm not trying to improve it--and I am singing like the others--just as it is in the notes."
And he honestly thought he was, too; and so he had no one to blame buthimself when his voice caught on the center occasionally and gave him thelockjaw.
There were those among the unregenerated who attributed the unceasinghead-winds to our distressing choir-music. There were those who saidopenly that it was taking chances enough to have such ghastly music goingon, even when it was at its best; and that to exaggerate the crime byletting George help was simply flying in the face of Providence. Thesesaid that the choir would keep up their lacerating attempts at melodyuntil they would bring down a storm some day that would sink the ship.
There were even grumblers at the prayers. The executive officer said thepilgrims had no charity:
"There they are, down there every night at eight bells, praying for fairwinds--when they know as well as I do that this is the only ship goingeast this time of the year, but there's a thousand coming west--what's afair wind for us is a head wind to them--the Almighty's blowing a fairwind for a thousand vessels, and this tribe wants him to turn it cleararound so as to accommodate one--and she a steamship at that! It ain'tgood sense, it ain't good reason, it ain't good Christianity, it ain'tcommon human charity. Avast with such nonsense!"
