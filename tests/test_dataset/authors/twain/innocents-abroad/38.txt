We returned to Constantinople, and after a day or two spent in exhaustingmarches about the city and voyages up the Golden Horn in caiques, westeamed away again. We passed through the Sea of Marmora and theDardanelles, and steered for a new land--a new one to us, at least--Asia.We had as yet only acquired a bowing acquaintance with it, throughpleasure excursions to Scutari and the regions round about.
We passed between Lemnos and Mytilene, and saw them as we had seen Elbaand the Balearic Isles--mere bulky shapes, with the softening mists ofdistance upon them--whales in a fog, as it were. Then we held our coursesouthward, and began to "read up" celebrated Smyrna.
At all hours of the day and night the sailors in the forecastle amusedthemselves and aggravated us by burlesquing our visit to royalty. Theopening paragraph of our Address to the Emperor was framed as follows:
 "We are a handful of private citizens of America, traveling simply for recreation--and unostentatiously, as becomes our unofficial state--and, therefore, we have no excuse to tender for presenting ourselves before your Majesty, save the desire of offering our grateful acknowledgments to the lord of a realm, which, through good and through evil report, has been the steadfast friend of the land we love so well."
The third cook, crowned with a resplendent tin basin and wrapped royallyin a table-cloth mottled with grease-spots and coffee stains, and bearinga sceptre that looked strangely like a belaying-pin, walked upon adilapidated carpet and perched himself on the capstan, careless of theflying spray; his tarred and weather-beaten Chamberlains, Dukes and LordHigh Admirals surrounded him, arrayed in all the pomp that sparetarpaulins and remnants of old sails could furnish. Then the visiting"watch below," transformed into graceless ladies and uncouth pilgrims, byrude travesties upon waterfalls, hoopskirts, white kid gloves andswallow-tail coats, moved solemnly up the companion way, and bowing low,began a system of complicated and extraordinary smiling which fewmonarchs could look upon and live. Then the mock consul, aslush-plastered deck-sweep, drew out a soiled fragment of paper andproceeded to read, laboriously:
"To His Imperial Majesty, Alexander II., Emperor of Russia:
"We are a handful of private citizens of America, traveling simply forrecreation,--and unostentatiously, as becomes our unofficial state--andtherefore, we have no excuse to tender for presenting ourselves beforeyour Majesty--"
The Emperor--"Then what the devil did you come for?"
--"Save the desire of offering our grateful acknowledgments to the lordof a realm which--"
The Emperor--"Oh, d--n the Address!--read it to the police.Chamberlain, take these people over to my brother, the Grand Duke's, andgive them a square meal. Adieu! I am happy--I am gratified--I amdelighted--I am bored. Adieu, adieu--vamos the ranch! The First Groomof the Palace will proceed to count the portable articles of valuebelonging to the premises."
The farce then closed, to be repeated again with every change of thewatches, and embellished with new and still more extravagant inventionsof pomp and conversation.
At all times of the day and night the phraseology of that tiresomeaddress fell upon our ears. Grimy sailors came down out of the foretopplacidly announcing themselves as "a handful of private citizens ofAmerica, traveling simply for recreation and unostentatiously," etc.; thecoal passers moved to their duties in the profound depths of the ship,explaining the blackness of their faces and their uncouthness of dress,with the reminder that they were "a handful of private citizens,traveling simply for recreation," etc., and when the cry rang through thevessel at midnight: "EIGHT BELLS!--LARBOARD WATCH, TURN OUT!" thelarboard watch came gaping and stretching out of their den, with theeverlasting formula: "Aye-aye, sir! We are a handful of private citizensof America, traveling simply for recreation, and unostentatiously, asbecomes our unofficial state!"
As I was a member of the committee, and helped to frame the Address,these sarcasms came home to me. I never heard a sailor proclaiminghimself as a handful of American citizens traveling for recreation, but Iwished he might trip and fall overboard, and so reduce his handful by oneindividual, at least. I never was so tired of any one phrase as thesailors made me of the opening sentence of the Address to the Emperor ofRussia.
This seaport of Smyrna, our first notable acquaintance in Asia, is aclosely packed city of one hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants, and,like Constantinople, it has no outskirts. It is as closely packed at itsouter edges as it is in the centre, and then the habitations leavesuddenly off and the plain beyond seems houseless. It is just like anyother Oriental city. That is to say, its Moslem houses are heavy anddark, and as comfortless as so many tombs; its streets are crooked,rudely and roughly paved, and as narrow as an ordinary staircase; thestreets uniformly carry a man to any other place than the one he wants togo to, and surprise him by landing him in the most unexpected localities;business is chiefly carried on in great covered bazaars, celled like ahoneycomb with innumerable shops no larger than a common closet, and thewhole hive cut up into a maze of alleys about wide enough to accommodatea laden camel, and well calculated to confuse a stranger and eventuallylose him; every where there is dirt, every where there are fleas, everywhere there are lean, broken-hearted dogs; every alley is thronged withpeople; wherever you look, your eye rests upon a wild masquerade ofextravagant costumes; the workshops are all open to the streets, and theworkmen visible; all manner of sounds assail the ear, and over them allrings out the muezzin's cry from some tall minaret, calling the faithfulvagabonds to prayer; and superior to the call to prayer, the noises inthe streets, the interest of the costumes--superior to every thing, andclaiming the bulk of attention first, last, and all the time--is acombination of Mohammedan stenches, to which the smell of even a Chinesequarter would be as pleasant as the roasting odors of the fatted calf tothe nostrils of the returning Prodigal. Such is Oriental luxury--such isOriental splendor! We read about it all our days, but we comprehend itnot until we see it. Smyrna is a very old city. Its name occurs severaltimes in the Bible, one or two of the disciples of Christ visited it, andhere was located one of the original seven apocalyptic churches spoken ofin Revelations. These churches were symbolized in the Scriptures ascandlesticks, and on certain conditions there was a sort of impliedpromise that Smyrna should be endowed with a "crown of life." She was to"be faithful unto death"--those were the terms. She has not kept up herfaith straight along, but the pilgrims that wander hither consider thatshe has come near enough to it to save her, and so they point to the factthat Smyrna to-day wears her crown of life, and is a great city, with agreat commerce and full of energy, while the cities wherein were locatedthe other six churches, and to which no crown of life was promised, havevanished from the earth. So Smyrna really still possesses her crown oflife, in a business point of view. Her career, for eighteen centuries,has been a chequered one, and she has been under the rule of princes ofmany creeds, yet there has been no season during all that time, as far aswe know, (and during such seasons as she was inhabited at all,) that shehas been without her little community of Christians "faithful untodeath." Hers was the only church against which no threats were impliedin the Revelations, and the only one which survived.
With Ephesus, forty miles from here, where was located another of theseven churches, the case was different. The "candlestick" has beenremoved from Ephesus. Her light has been put out. Pilgrims, alwaysprone to find prophecies in the Bible, and often where none exist, speakcheerfully and complacently of poor, ruined Ephesus as the victim ofprophecy. And yet there is no sentence that promises, without duequalification, the destruction of the city. The words are:
 "Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent."
That is all; the other verses are singularly complimentary to Ephesus.The threat is qualified. There is no history to show that she did notrepent. But the cruelest habit the modern prophecy-savans have, is thatone of coolly and arbitrarily fitting the prophetic shirt on to the wrongman. They do it without regard to rhyme or reason. Both the cases Ihave just mentioned are instances in point. Those "prophecies" aredistinctly leveled at the "churches of Ephesus, Smyrna," etc., and yetthe pilgrims invariably make them refer to the cities instead. No crownof life is promised to the town of Smyrna and its commerce, but to thehandful of Christians who formed its "church." If they were "faithfulunto death," they have their crown now--but no amount of faithfulness andlegal shrewdness combined could legitimately drag the city into aparticipation in the promises of the prophecy. The stately language ofthe Bible refers to a crown of life whose lustre will reflect theday-beams of the endless ages of eternity, not the butterfly existenceof a city built by men's hands, which must pass to dust with thebuilders and be forgotten even in the mere handful of centuriesvouchsafed to the solid world itself between its cradle and its grave.
The fashion of delving out fulfillments of prophecy where that prophecyconsists of mere "ifs," trenches upon the absurd. Suppose, a thousandyears from now, a malarious swamp builds itself up in the shallow harborof Smyrna, or something else kills the town; and suppose, also, thatwithin that time the swamp that has filled the renowned harbor of Ephesusand rendered her ancient site deadly and uninhabitable to-day, becomeshard and healthy ground; suppose the natural consequence ensues, to wit:that Smyrna becomes a melancholy ruin, and Ephesus is rebuilt. Whatwould the prophecy-savans say? They would coolly skip over our age ofthe world, and say: "Smyrna was not faithful unto death, and so her crownof life was denied her; Ephesus repented, and lo! her candle-stick wasnot removed. Behold these evidences! How wonderful is prophecy!"
Smyrna has been utterly destroyed six times. If her crown of life hadbeen an insurance policy, she would have had an opportunity to collect onit the first time she fell. But she holds it on sufferance and by acomplimentary construction of language which does not refer toher. Six different times, however, I suppose some infatuatedprophecy-enthusiast blundered along and said, to the infinite disgust ofSmyrna and the Smyrniotes: "In sooth, here is astounding fulfillment ofprophecy! Smyrna hath not been faithful unto death, and behold hercrown of life is vanished from her head. Verily, these things beastonishing!"
Such things have a bad influence. They provoke worldly men into usinglight conversation concerning sacred subjects. Thick-headed commentatorsupon the Bible, and stupid preachers and teachers, work more damage toreligion than sensible, cool-brained clergymen can fight away again, toilas they may. It is not good judgment to fit a crown of life upon a citywhich has been destroyed six times. That other class of wiseacres whotwist prophecy in such a manner as to make it promise the destruction anddesolation of the same city, use judgment just as bad, since the city isin a very flourishing condition now, unhappily for them. These thingsput arguments into the mouth of infidelity.
A portion of the city is pretty exclusively Turkish; the Jews have aquarter to themselves; the Franks another quarter; so, also, with theArmenians. The Armenians, of course, are Christians. Their houses arelarge, clean, airy, handsomely paved with black and white squares ofmarble, and in the centre of many of them is a square court, which has init a luxuriant flower-garden and a sparkling fountain; the doors of allthe rooms open on this. A very wide hall leads to the street door, andin this the women sit, the most of the day. In the cool of the eveningthey dress up in their best raiment and show themselves at the door.They are all comely of countenance, and exceedingly neat and cleanly;they look as if they were just out of a band-box. Some of the youngladies--many of them, I may say--are even very beautiful; they average ashade better than American girls--which treasonable words I pray may beforgiven me. They are very sociable, and will smile back when a strangersmiles at them, bow back when he bows, and talk back if he speaks tothem. No introduction is required. An hour's chat at the door with apretty girl one never saw before, is easily obtained, and is verypleasant. I have tried it. I could not talk anything but English, andthe girl knew nothing but Greek, or Armenian, or some such barbaroustongue, but we got along very well. I find that in cases like these, thefact that you can not comprehend each other isn't much of a drawback.In that Russia n town of Yalta I danced an astonishing sort of dance anhour long, and one I had not heard of before, with a very pretty girl,and we talked incessantly, and laughed exhaustingly, and neither one everknew what the other was driving at. But it was splendid. There weretwenty people in the set, and the dance was very lively and complicated.It was complicated enough without me--with me it was more so. I threw ina figure now and then that surprised those Russians. But I have neverceased to think of that girl. I have written to her, but I can notdirect the epistle because her name is one of those nine-jointed Russianaffairs, and there are not letters enough in our alphabet to hold out.I am not reckless enough to try to pronounce it when I am awake, but Imake a stagger at it in my dreams, and get up with the lockjaw in themorning. I am fading. I do not take my meals now, with any sort ofregularity. Her dear name haunts me still in my dreams. It is awful onteeth. It never comes out of my mouth but it fetches an old snag alongwith it. And then the lockjaw closes down and nips off a couple of thelast syllables--but they taste good.
Coming through the Dardanelles, we saw camel trains on shore with theglasses, but we were never close to one till we got to Smyrna. Thesecamels are very much larger than the scrawny specimens one sees in themenagerie. They stride along these streets, in single file, a dozen in atrain, with heavy loads on their backs, and a fancy-looking negro inTurkish costume, or an Arab, preceding them on a little donkey andcompletely overshadowed and rendered insignificant by the huge beasts.To see a camel train laden with the spices of Arabia and the rare fabricsof Persia come marching through the narrow alleys of the bazaar, amongporters with their burdens, money-changers, lamp-merchants, Al-nascharsin the glassware business, portly cross-legged Turks smoking the famousnarghili; and the crowds drifting to and fro in the fanciful costumes ofthe East, is a genuine revelation of the Orient. The picture lacksnothing. It casts you back at once into your forgotten boyhood, andagain you dream over the wonders of the Arabian Nights; again yourcompanions are princes, your lord is the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid, andyour servants are terrific giants and genii that come with smoke andlightning and thunder, and go as a storm goes when they depart!
