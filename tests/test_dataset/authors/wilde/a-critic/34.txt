(Woman's World, March 1889.)


'The Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems is, I believe, the first
volume of poems that Mr. Yeats has published, and it is certainly full of
promise. It must be admitted that many of the poems are too fragmentary,
too incomplete. They read like stray scenes out of unfinished plays,
like things only half remembered, or, at best, but dimly seen. But the
architectonic power of construction, the power to build up and make
perfect a harmonious whole, is nearly always the latest, as it certainly
is the highest, development of the artistic temperament. It is somewhat
unfair to expect it in early work. One quality Mr. Yeats has in a marked
degree, a quality that is not common in the work of our minor poets, and
is therefore all the more welcome to us--I mean the romantic temper. He
is essentially Celtic, and his verse, at its best, is Celtic also.
Strongly influenced by Keats, he seems to study how to 'load every rift
with ore,' yet is more fascinated by the beauty of words than by the
beauty of metrical music. The spirit that dominates the whole book is
perhaps more valuable than any individual poem or particular passage, but
this from The Wanderings of Oisin is worth quoting. It describes the
ride to the Island of Forgetfulness:
    And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow light,
       For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world
    and the sun,
    Ceased on our hands and faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light,
       And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world
    was one;
    Till the horse gave a whinny; for cumbrous with stems of the hazel
    and oak,
       Of hollies, and hazels, and oak-trees, a valley was sloping away
    From his hoofs in the heavy grasses, with monstrous slumbering folk,
       Their mighty and naked and gleaming bodies heaped loose where they
    lay.
    More comely than man may make them, inlaid with silver and gold,
       Were arrow and shield and war-axe, arrow and spear and blade,
    And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollows a child of three years old
       Could sleep on a couch of rushes, round and about them laid.


And this, which deals with the old legend of the city lying under the
waters of a lake, is strange and interesting:
    The maker of the stars and worlds
       Sat underneath the market cross,
    And the old men were walking, walking,
       And little boys played pitch-and-toss.
    'The props,' said He, 'of stars and worlds
       Are prayers of patient men and good.
    The boys, the women, and old men,
       Listening, upon their shadows stood.
    A grey professor passing cried,
       'How few the mind's intemperance rule!
    What shallow thoughts about deep things!
       The world grows old and plays the fool.'
    The mayor came, leaning his left ear--
       There were some talking of the poor--
    And to himself cried, 'Communist!'
       And hurried to the guardhouse door.
    The bishop came with open book,
       Whispering along the sunny path;
    There was some talking of man's God,
       His God of stupor and of wrath.
    The bishop murmured, 'Atheist!
       How sinfully the wicked scoff!'
    And sent the old men on their way,
       And drove the boys and women off.
    The place was empty now of people;
       A cock came by upon his toes;
    An old horse looked across the fence,
       And rubbed along the rail his nose.
    The maker of the stars and worlds
       To His own house did Him betake,
    And on that city dropped a tear,
       And now that city is a lake.


Mr. Yeats has a great deal of invention, and some of the poems in his
book, such as Mosada, Jealousy, and The Island of Statues, are very
finely conceived. It is impossible to doubt, after reading his present
volume, that he will some day give us work of high import. Up to this he
has been merely trying the strings of his instrument, running over the
keys.
