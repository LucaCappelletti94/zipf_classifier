"Classic." A book which people praise and don't read. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
On the rail again--bound for Bendigo. From diary:
October 23. Got up at 6, left at 7.30; soon reached Castlemaine, one ofthe rich gold-fields of the early days; waited several hours for a train;left at 3.40 and reached Bendigo in an hour. For comrade, a Catholicpriest who was better than I was, but didn't seem to know it--a man fullof graces of the heart, the mind, and the spirit; a lovable man. He willrise. He will be a bishop some day. Later an Archbishop. Later aCardinal. Finally an Archangel, I hope. And then he will recall me whenI say, "Do you remember that trip we made from Ballarat to Bendigo, whenyou were nothing but Father C., and I was nothing to what I am now?"It has actually taken nine hours to come from Ballarat to Bendigo. Wecould have saved seven by walking. However, there was no hurry.
Bendigo was another of the rich strikes of the early days. It does agreat quartz-mining business, now--that business which, more than anyother that I know of, teaches patience, and requires grit and a steadynerve. The town is full of towering chimney-stacks, and hoisting-works,and looks like a petroleum-city. Speaking of patience; for example, oneof the local companies went steadily on with its deep borings andsearchings without show of gold or a penny of reward for eleven years--then struck it, and became suddenly rich. The eleven years' work hadcost $55,000, and the first gold found was a grain the size of a pin'shead. It is kept under locks and bars, as a precious thing, and isreverently shown to the visitor, "hats off." When I saw it I had notheard its history.
"It is gold. Examine it--take the glass. Now how much should you say itis worth?"
I said:
"I should say about two cents; or in your English dialect, fourfarthings."
"Well, it cost L11,000."
"Oh, come!"
"Yes, it did. Ballarat and Bendigo have produced the three monumentalnuggets of the world, and this one is the monumentalest one of the three.The other two represent 19,000 a piece; this one a couple of thousandmore. It is small, and not much to look at, but it is entitled to (its)name--Adam. It is the Adam-nugget of this mine, and its children run upinto the millions."
Speaking of patience again, another of the mines was worked, under heavyexpenses, during 17 years before pay was struck, and still another onecompelled a wait of 21 years before pay was struck; then, in bothinstances, the outlay was all back in a year or two, with compoundinterest.
Bendigo has turned out even more gold than Ballarat. The two togetherhave produced $650,000,000 worth--which is half as much as California hasproduced.
It was through Mr. Blank--not to go into particulars about his name--itwas mainly through Mr. Blank that my stay in Bendigo was made memorablypleasant and interesting. He explained this to me himself. He told methat it was through his influence that the city government invited me tothe town-hall to hear complimentary speeches and respond to them; that itwas through his influence that I had been taken on a long pleasure-drivethrough the city and shown its notable features; that it was through hisinfluence that I was invited to visit the great mines; that it wasthrough his influence that I was taken to the hospital and allowed to seethe convalescent Chinaman who had been attacked at midnight in his lonelyhut eight weeks before by robbers, and stabbed forty-six times andscalped besides; that it was through his influence that when I arrivedthis awful spectacle of piecings and patchings and bandagings was sittingup in his cot letting on to read one of my books; that it was through hisinfluence that efforts had been made to get the Catholic Archbishop ofBendigo to invite me to dinner; that it was through his influence thatefforts had been made to get the Anglican Bishop of Bendigo to ask me tosupper; that it was through his influence that the dean of the editorialfraternity had driven me through the woodsy outlying country and shownme, from the summit of Lone Tree Hill, the mightiest and loveliestexpanse of forest-clad mountain and valley that I had seen in allAustralia. And when he asked me what had most impressed me in Bendigoand I answered and said it was the taste and the public spirit which hadadorned the streets with 105 miles of shade trees, he said that it wasthrough his influence that it had been done.
But I am not representing him quite correctly. He did not say it wasthrough his influence that all these things had happened--for that wouldhave been coarse; he merely conveyed that idea; conveyed it so subtlythat I only caught it fleetingly, as one catches vagrant faint breaths ofperfume when one traverses the meadows in summer; conveyed it withoutoffense and without any suggestion of egoism or ostentation--but conveyedit, nevertheless.
He was an Irishman; an educated gentleman; grave, and kindly, andcourteous; a bachelor, and about forty-five or possibly fifty years old,apparently. He called upon me at the hotel, and it was there that we hadthis talk. He made me like him, and did it without trouble. This waspartly through his winning and gentle ways, but mainly through theamazing familiarity with my books which his conversation showed. He wasdown to date with them, too; and if he had made them the study of hislife he could hardly have been better posted as to their contents than hewas. He made me better satisfied with myself than I had ever beenbefore. It was plain that he had a deep fondness for humor, yet he neverlaughed; he never even chuckled; in fact, humor could not win to outwardexpression on his face at all. No, he was always grave--tenderly,pensively grave; but he made me laugh, all along; and this was verytrying--and very pleasant at the same time--for it was at quotations frommy own books.
When he was going, he turned and said:
"You don't remember me?"
"I? Why, no. Have we met before?"
"No, it was a matter of correspondence."
"Correspondence?"
"Yes, many years ago. Twelve or fifteen. Oh, longer than that. But ofcourse you----" A musing pause. Then he said:
"Do you remember Corrigan Castle?"
"N-no, I believe I don't. I don't seem to recall the name."
He waited a moment, pondering, with the door-knob in his hand, thenstarted out; but turned back and said that I had once been interested inCorrigan Castle, and asked me if I would go with him to his quarters inthe evening and take a hot Scotch and talk it over. I was a teetotalerand liked relaxation, so I said I would.
We drove from the lecture-hall together about half-past ten. He had amost comfortably and tastefully furnished parlor, with good pictures onthe walls, Indian and Japanese ornaments on the mantel, and here andthere, and books everywhere-largely mine; which made me proud. The lightwas brilliant, the easy chairs were deep-cushioned, the arrangements forbrewing and smoking were all there. We brewed and lit up; then he passeda sheet of note-paper to me and said--
"Do you remember that?"
"Oh, yes, indeed!"
The paper was of a sumptuous quality. At the top was a twisted andinterlaced monogram printed from steel dies in gold and blue and red, inthe ornate English fashion of long years ago; and under it, in neatgothic capitals was this--printed in blue:
 THE MARK TWAIN CLUB CORRIGAN CASTLE ............187..
"My!" said I, "how did you come by this?"
"I was President of it."
"No!--you don't mean it."
"It is true. I was its first President. I was re-elected annually aslong as its meetings were held in my castle--Corrigan--which was fiveyears."
Then he showed me an album with twenty-three photographs of me in it.Five of them were of old dates, the others of various later crops; thelist closed with a picture taken by Falk in Sydney a month before.
"You sent us the first five; the rest were bought."
This was paradise! We ran late, and talked, talked, talked--subject, theMark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle, Ireland.
My first knowledge of that Club dates away back; all of twenty years, Ishould say. It came to me in the form of a courteous letter, written onthe note-paper which I have described, and signed "By order of thePresident; C. PEMBROKE, Secretary." It conveyed the fact that the Clubhad been created in my honor, and added the hope that this token ofappreciation of my work would meet with my approval.
I answered, with thanks; and did what I could to keep my gratificationfrom over-exposure.
It was then that the long correspondence began. A letter came back, byorder of the President, furnishing me the names of the members-thirty-twoin number. With it came a copy of the Constitution and By-Laws, inpamphlet form, and artistically printed. The initiation fee and dueswere in their proper place; also, schedule of meetings--monthly--foressays upon works of mine, followed by discussions; quarterly forbusiness and a supper, without essays, but with after-supper speechesalso, there was a list of the officers: President, Vice-President,Secretary, Treasurer, etc. The letter was brief, but it was pleasantreading, for it told me about the strong interest which the membershiptook in their new venture, etc., etc. It also asked me for a photograph--a special one. I went down and sat for it and sent it--with a letter,of course.
Presently came the badge of the Club, and very dainty and pretty it was;and very artistic. It was a frog peeping out from a graceful tangle ofgrass-sprays and rushes, and was done in enamels on a gold basis, and hada gold pin back of it. After I had petted it, and played with it, andcaressed it, and enjoyed it a couple of hours, the light happened to fallupon it at a new angle, and revealed to me a cunning new detail; with thelight just right, certain delicate shadings of the grass-blades andrush-stems wove themselves into a monogram--mine! You can see that thatjewel was a work of art. And when you come to consider the intrinsicvalue of it, you must concede that it is not every literary club thatcould afford a badge like that. It was easily worth $75, in the opinionof Messrs. Marcus and Ward of New York. They said they could notduplicate it for that and make a profit. By this time the Club was wellunder way; and from that time forth its secretary kept my off-hours wellsupplied with business. He reported the Club's discussions of my bookswith laborious fullness, and did his work with great spirit and ability.As a, rule, he synopsized; but when a speech was especially brilliant, heshort-handed it and gave me the best passages from it, written out.There were five speakers whom he particularly favored in that way:Palmer, Forbes, Naylor, Norris, and Calder. Palmer and Forbes couldnever get through a speech without attacking each other, and each in hisown way was formidably effective--Palmer in virile and eloquent abuse,Forbes in courtly and elegant but scalding satire. I could always tellwhich of them was talking without looking for his name. Naylor had apolished style and a happy knack at felicitous metaphor; Norris's stylewas wholly without ornament, but enviably compact, lucid, and strong.But after all, Calder was the gem. He never spoke when sober, he spokecontinuously when he wasn't. And certainly they were the drunkestspeeches that a man ever uttered. They were full of good things, but soincredibly mixed up and wandering that it made one's head swim to followhim. They were not intended to be funny, but they were,--funny for thevery gravity which the speaker put into his flowing miracles ofincongruity. In the course of five years I came to know the styles ofthe five orators as well as I knew the style of any speaker in my ownclub at home.
These reports came every month. They were written on foolscap, 600 wordsto the page, and usually about twenty-five pages in a report--a good15,000 words, I should say,--a solid week's work. The reports wereabsorbingly entertaining, long as they were; but, unfortunately for me,they did not come alone. They were always accompanied by a lot ofquestions about passages and purposes in my books, which the Club wantedanswered; and additionally accompanied every quarter by the Treasurer'sreport, and the Auditor's report, and the Committee's report, and thePresident's review, and my opinion of these was always desired; alsosuggestions for the good of the Club, if any occurred to me.
By and by I came to dread those things; and this dread grew and grew andgrew; grew until I got to anticipating them with a cold horror. For Iwas an indolent man, and not fond of letter-writing, and whenever thesethings came I had to put everything by and sit down--for my own peace ofmind--and dig and dig until I got something out of my head which wouldanswer for a reply. I got along fairly well the first year; but for thesucceeding four years the Mark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle was mycurse, my nightmare, the grief and misery of my life. And I got so, sosick of sitting for photographs. I sat every year for five years, tryingto satisfy that insatiable organization. Then at last I rose in revolt.I could endure my oppressions no longer. I pulled my fortitude togetherand tore off my chains, and was a free man again, and happy. From thatday I burned the secretary's fat envelopes the moment they arrived, andby and by they ceased to come.
Well, in the sociable frankness of that night in Bendigo I brought thisall out in full confession. Then Mr. Blank came out in the same frankway, and with a preliminary word of gentle apology said that he was theMark Twain Club, and the only member it had ever had!
Why, it was matter for anger, but I didn't feel any. He said he neverhad to work for a living, and that by the time he was thirty life hadbecome a bore and a weariness to him. He had no interests left; they hadpaled and perished, one by one, and left him desolate. He had begun tothink of suicide. Then all of a sudden he thought of that happy idea ofstarting an imaginary club, and went straightway to work at it, withenthusiasm and love. He was charmed with it; it gave him something todo. It elaborated itself on his hands;--it became twenty times morecomplex and formidable than was his first rude draft of it. Every newaddition to his original plan which cropped up in his mind gave him afresh interest and a new pleasure. He designed the Club badge himself,and worked over it, altering and improving it, a number of days andnights; then sent to London and had it made. It was the only one thatwas made. It was made for me; the "rest of the Club" went without.
He invented the thirty-two members and their names. He invented the fivefavorite speakers and their five separate styles. He invented theirspeeches, and reported them himself. He would have kept that Club goinguntil now, if I hadn't deserted, he said. He said he worked like a slaveover those reports; each of them cost him from a week to a fortnight'swork, and the work gave him pleasure and kept him alive and willing to bealive. It was a bitter blow to him when the Club died.
Finally, there wasn't any Corrigan Castle. He had invented that, too.
It was wonderful--the whole thing; and altogether the most ingenious andlaborious and cheerful and painstaking practical joke I have ever heardof. And I liked it; liked to bear him tell about it; yet I have been ahater of practical jokes from as long back as I can remember. Finally hesaid--
"Do you remember a note from Melbourne fourteen or fifteen years ago,telling about your lecture tour in Australia, and your death and burialin Melbourne?--a note from Henry Bascomb, of Bascomb Hall, UpperHolywell Hants."
"Yes."
"I wrote it."
"M-y-word!"
"Yes, I did it. I don't know why. I just took the notion, and carriedit out without stopping to think. It was wrong. It could have doneharm. I was always sorry about it afterward. You must forgive me. Iwas Mr. Bascom's guest on his yacht, on his voyage around the world. Heoften spoke of you, and of the pleasant times you had had together in hishome; and the notion took me, there in Melbourne, and I imitated hishand, and wrote the letter."
So the mystery was cleared up, after so many, many years.
