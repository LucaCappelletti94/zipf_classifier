I have traveled more than anyone else, and I have noticed that even theangels speak English with an accent. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
I saw Table Rock, anyway--a majestic pile. It is 3,000 feet high. It isalso 17,000 feet high. These figures may be relied upon. I got them inCape Town from the two best-informed citizens, men who had made TableRock the study of their lives. And I saw Table Bay, so named for itslevelness. I saw the Castle--built by the Dutch East India Company threehundred years ago--where the Commanding General lives; I saw St. Simon'sBay, where the Admiral lives. I saw the Government, also the Parliament,where they quarreled in two languages when I was there, and agreed innone. I saw the club. I saw and explored the beautiful sea-girt drivesthat wind about the mountains and through the paradise where the villasare: Also I saw some of the fine old Dutch mansions, pleasant homes ofthe early times, pleasant homes to-day, and enjoyed the privilege oftheir hospitalities.
And just before I sailed I saw in one of them a quaint old picture whichwas a link in a curious romance--a picture of a pale, intellectual youngman in a pink coat with a high black collar. It was a portrait of Dr.James Barry, a military surgeon who came out to the Cape fifty years agowith his regiment. He was a wild young fellow, and was guilty of variouskinds of misbehavior. He was several times reported to headquarters inEngland, and it was in each case expected that orders would come out todeal with him promptly and severely, but for some mysterious reason noorders of any kind ever came back--nothing came but just an impressivesilence. This made him an imposing and uncanny wonder to the town.
Next, he was promoted-away up. He was made Medical SuperintendentGeneral, and transferred to India. Presently he was back at the Capeagain and at his escapades once more. There were plenty of pretty girls,but none of them caught him, none of them could get hold of his heart;evidently he was not a marrying man. And that was another marvel,another puzzle, and made no end of perplexed talk. Once he was called inthe night, an obstetric service, to do what he could for a woman who wasbelieved to be dying. He was prompt and scientific, and saved bothmother and child. There are other instances of record which testify tohis mastership of his profession; and many which testify to his love ofit and his devotion to it. Among other adventures of his was a duel of adesperate sort, fought with swords, at the Castle. He killed his man.
The child heretofore mentioned as having been saved by Dr. Barry so longago, was named for him, and still lives in Cape Town. He had Dr.Barry's portrait painted, and gave it to the gentleman in whose old Dutchhouse I saw it--the quaint figure in pink coat and high black collar.
The story seems to be arriving nowhere. But that is because I have notfinished. Dr. Barry died in Cape Town 30 years ago. It was thendiscovered that he was a woman.
The legend goes that enquiries--soon silenced--developed the fact thatshe was a daughter of a great English house, and that that was why herCape wildnesses brought no punishment and got no notice when reported tothe government at home. Her name was an alias. She had disgracedherself with her people; so she chose to change her name and her sex andtake a new start in the world.
We sailed on the 15th of July in the Norman, a beautiful ship, perfectlyappointed. The voyage to England occupied a short fortnight, without astop except at Madeira. A good and restful voyage for tired people, andthere were several of us. I seemed to have been lecturing a thousandyears, though it was only a twelvemonth, and a considerable number of theothers were Reformers who were fagged out with their five months ofseclusion in the Pretoria prison.
Our trip around the earth ended at the Southampton pier, where weembarked thirteen months before. It seemed a fine and large thing tohave accomplished--the circumnavigation of this great globe in thatlittle time, and I was privately proud of it. For a moment.Then came one of those vanity-snubbing astronomical reports from theObservatory-people, whereby it appeared that another great body of lighthad lately flamed up in the remotenesses of space which was traveling ata gait which would enable it to do all that I had done in a minute and ahalf. Human pride is not worth while; there is always something lying inwait to take the wind out of it.
