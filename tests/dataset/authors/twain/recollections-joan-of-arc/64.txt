Undaunted by Threat of Burning
TWO WEEKS went by; the second of May was come, the chill was departed outof the air, the wild flowers were springing in the glades and glens, thebirds were piping in the woods, all nature was brilliant with sunshine,all spirits were renewed and refreshed, all hearts glad, the world wasalive with hope and cheer, the plain beyond the Seine stretched away softand rich and green, the river was limpid and lovely, the leafy islandswere dainty to see, and flung still daintier reflections of themselvesupon the shining water; and from the tall bluffs above the bridge Rouenwas become again a delight to the eye, the most exquisite and satisfyingpicture of a town that nestles under the arch of heaven anywhere.
When I say that all hearts were glad and hopeful, I mean it in a generalsense. There were exceptions--we who were the friends of Joan of Arc,also Joan of Arc herself, that poor girl shut up there in that frowningstretch of mighty walls and towers: brooding in darkness, so close to theflooding downpour of sunshine yet so impossibly far away from it; solonging for any little glimpse of it, yet so implacably denied it bythose wolves in the black gowns who were plotting her death and theblackening of her good name.
Cauchon was ready to go on with his miserable work. He had a new schemeto try now. He would see what persuasion could do--argument, eloquence,poured out upon the incorrigible captive from the mouth of a trainedexpert. That was his plan. But the reading of the Twelve Articles to herwas not a part of it. No, even Cauchon was ashamed to lay thatmonstrosity before her; even he had a remnant of shame in him, away downdeep, a million fathoms deep, and that remnant asserted itself now andprevailed.
On this fair second of May, then, the black company gathered itselftogether in the spacious chamber at the end of the great hall of thecastle--the Bishop of Beauvais on his throne, and sixty-two minor judgesmassed before him, with the guards and recorders at their stations andthe orator at his desk.
Then we heard the far clank of chains, and presently Joan entered withher keepers and took her seat upon her isolated bench. She was lookingwell now, and most fair and beautiful after her fortnight's rest fromwordy persecution.
She glanced about and noted the orator. Doubtless she divined thesituation.
The orator had written his speech all out, and had it in his hand, thoughhe held it back of him out of sight. It was so thick that it resembled abook. He began flowing, but in the midst of a flowery period his memoryfailed him and he had to snatch a furtive glance at his manuscript--whichmuch injured the effect. Again this happened, and then a third time. Thepoor man's face was red with embarrassment, the whole great house waspitying him, which made the matter worse; then Joan dropped in a remarkwhich completed the trouble. She said:
"Read your book--and then I will answer you!"
Why, it was almost cruel the way those moldy veterans laughed; and as forthe orator, he looked so flustered and helpless that almost anybody wouldhave pitied him, and I had difficulty to keep from doing it myself. Yes,Joan was feeling very well after her rest, and the native mischief thatwas in her lay near the surface. It did not show when she made theremark, but I knew it was close in there back of the words.
When the orator had gotten back his composure he did a wise thing; for hefollowed Joan's advice: he made no more attempts at sham impromptuoratory, but read his speech straight from his "book." In the speech hecompressed the Twelve Articles into six, and made these his text.
Every now and then he stopped and asked questions, and Joan replied. Thenature of the Church Militant was explained, and once more Joan was askedto submit herself to it.
She gave her usual answer.
Then she was asked:
"Do you believe the Church can err?"
"I believe it cannot err; but for those deeds and words of mine whichwere done and uttered by command of God, I will answer to Him alone."
"Will you say that you have no judge upon earth? Is not our Holy Fatherthe Pope your judge?"
"I will say nothing about it. I have a good Master who is our Lord, andto Him I will submit all."
Then came these terrible words:
"If you do not submit to the Church you will be pronounced a heretic bythese judges here present and burned at the stake!"
Ah, that would have smitten you or me dead with fright, but it onlyroused the lion heart of Joan of Arc, and in her answer rang that martialnote which had used to stir her soldiers like a bugle-call:
"I will not say otherwise than I have said already; and if I saw the firebefore me I would say it again!"
It was uplifting to hear her battle-voice once more and see thebattle-light burn in her eye. Many there were stirred; every man that wasa man was stirred, whether friend or foe; and Manchon risked his lifeagain, good soul, for he wrote in the margin of the record in good plainletters these brave words: "Superba responsio!" and there they haveremained these sixty years, and there you may read them to this day.
"Superba responsio!" Yes, it was just that. For this "superb answer" camefrom the lips of a girl of nineteen with death and hell staring her inthe face.
Of course, the matter of the male attire was gone over again; and asusual at wearisome length; also, as usual, the customary bribe wasoffered: if she would discard that dress voluntarily they would let herhear mass. But she answered as she had often answered before:
"I will go in a woman's robe to all services of the Church if I may bepermitted, but I will resume the other dress when I return to my cell."
They set several traps for her in a tentative form; that is to say, theyplaced suppositious propositions before her and cunningly tried to commither to one end of the propositions without committing themselves to theother. But she always saw the game and spoiled it. The trap was in thisform:
"Would you be willing to do so and so if we should give you leave?"
Her answer was always in this form or to this effect:
"When you give me leave, then you will know."
Yes, Joan was at her best that second of May. She had all her wits abouther, and they could not catch her anywhere. It was a long, long session,and all the old ground was fought over again, foot by foot, and theorator-expert worked all his persuasions, all his eloquence; but theresult was the familiar one--a drawn battle, the sixty-two retiring upontheir base, the solitary enemy holding her original position within heroriginal lines.
