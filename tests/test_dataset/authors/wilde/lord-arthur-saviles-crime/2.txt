Ten minutes later, with face blanched by terror, and eyes wild withgrief, Lord Arthur Savile rushed from Bentinck House, crushing hisway through the crowd of fur-coated footmen that stood round thelarge striped awning, and seeming not to see or hear anything. Thenight was bitter cold, and the gas-lamps round the square flared andflickered in the keen wind; but his hands were hot with fever, andhis forehead burned like fire. On and on he went, almost with thegait of a drunken man. A policeman looked curiously at him as hepassed, and a beggar, who slouched from an archway to ask for alms,grew frightened, seeing misery greater than his own. Once hestopped under a lamp, and looked at his hands. He thought he coulddetect the stain of blood already upon them, and a faint cry brokefrom his trembling lips.
Murder! that is what the cheiromantist had seen there. Murder! Thevery night seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it inhis ear. The dark corners of the streets were full of it. Itgrinned at him from the roofs of the houses.
First he came to the Park, whose sombre woodland seemed to fascinatehim. He leaned wearily up against the railings, cooling his browagainst the wet metal, and listening to the tremulous silence of thetrees. 'Murder! murder!' he kept repeating, as though iterationcould dim the horror of the word. The sound of his own voice madehim shudder, yet he almost hoped that Echo might hear him, and wakethe slumbering city from its dreams. He felt a mad desire to stopthe casual passer-by, and tell him everything.
Then he wandered across Oxford Street into narrow, shameful alleys.Two women with painted faces mocked at him as he went by. From adark courtyard came a sound of oaths and blows, followed by shrillscreams, and, huddled upon a damp door-step, he saw the crook-backedforms of poverty and eld. A strange pity came over him. Were thesechildren of sin and misery predestined to their end, as he to his?Were they, like him, merely the puppets of a monstrous show?
And yet it was not the mystery, but the comedy of suffering thatstruck him; its absolute uselessness, its grotesque want of meaning.How incoherent everything seemed! How lacking in all harmony! Hewas amazed at the discord between the shallow optimism of the day,and the real facts of existence. He was still very young.
After a time he found himself in front of Marylebone Church. Thesilent roadway looked like a long riband of polished silver, fleckedhere and there by the dark arabesques of waving shadows. Far intothe distance curved the line of flickering gas-lamps, and outside alittle walled-in house stood a solitary hansom, the driver asleepinside. He walked hastily in the direction of Portland Place, nowand then looking round, as though he feared that he was beingfollowed. At the corner of Rich Street stood two men, reading asmall bill upon a hoarding. An odd feeling of curiosity stirredhim, and he crossed over. As he came near, the word 'Murder,'printed in black letters, met his eye. He started, and a deep flushcame into his cheek. It was an advertisement offering a reward forany information leading to the arrest of a man of medium height,between thirty and forty years of age, wearing a billy-cock hat, ablack coat, and check trousers, and with a scar upon his rightcheek. He read it over and over again, and wondered if the wretchedman would be caught, and how he had been scarred. Perhaps, someday, his own name might be placarded on the walls of London. Someday, perhaps, a price would be set on his head also.
The thought made him sick with horror. He turned on his heel, andhurried on into the night.
Where he went he hardly knew. He had a dim memory of wanderingthrough a labyrinth of sordid houses, of being lost in a giant webof sombre streets, and it was bright dawn when he found himself atlast in Piccadilly Circus. As he strolled home towards BelgraveSquare, he met the great waggons on their way to Covent Garden. Thewhite-smocked carters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarsecurly hair, strode sturdily on, cracking their whips, and callingout now and then to each other; on the back of a huge grey horse,the leader of a jangling team, sat a chubby boy, with a bunch ofprimroses in his battered hat, keeping tight hold of the mane withhis little hands, and laughing; and the great piles of vegetableslooked like masses of jade against the morning sky, like masses ofgreen jade against the pink petals of some marvellous rose. LordArthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why. There wassomething in the dawn's delicate loveliness that seemed to himinexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break inbeauty, and that set in storm. These rustics, too, with theirrough, good-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what astrange London they saw! A London free from the sin of night andthe smoke of day, a pallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town oftombs! He wondered what they thought of it, and whether they knewanything of its splendour and its shame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and its horrible hunger, of all it makes and marsfrom morn to eve. Probably it was to them merely a mart where theybrought their fruits to sell, and where they tarried for a few hoursat most, leaving the streets still silent, the houses still asleep.It gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by. Rude as theywere, with their heavy, hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait,they brought a little of a ready with them. He felt that they hadlived with Nature, and that she had taught them peace. He enviedthem all that they did not know.
By the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue,and the birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.
