Pity is for the living, Envy is for the dead. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

The successor of the sheet-iron hamlet of the mangrove marshes has thatother Australian specialty, the Botanical Gardens.  We cannot have theseparadises.  The best we could do would be to cover a vast acreage underglass and apply steam heat.  But it would be inadequate, the lacks wouldstill be so great: the confined sense, the sense of suffocation, theatmospheric dimness, the sweaty heat--these would all be there, in placeof the Australian openness to the sky, the sunshine and the breeze.Whatever will grow under glass with us will flourish rampantly out ofdoors in Australia.--[The greatest heat in Victoria, that there is anauthoritative record of, was at Sandhurst, in January, 1862.  Thethermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade.  In January, 1880,the heat at Adelaide, South Australia, was 172 degrees in the sun.]
When the white man came the continent was nearly as poor, in variety ofvegetation, as the desert of Sahara; now it has everything that grows onthe earth.  In fact, not Australia only, but all Australasia has leviedtribute upon the flora of the rest of the world; and wherever one goesthe results appear, in gardens private and public, in the woodsy walls ofthe highways, and in even the forests.  If you see a curious or beautifultree or bush or flower, and ask about it, the people, answering, usuallyname a foreign country as the place of its origin--India, Africa, Japan,China, England, America, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, Polynesia, and so on.
In the Zoological Gardens of Adelaide I saw the only laughing jackassthat ever showed any disposition to be courteous to me.  This one openedhis head wide and laughed like a demon; or like a maniac who was consumedwith humorous scorn over a cheap and degraded pun.  It was a very humanlaugh.  If he had been out of sight I could have believed that thelaughter came from a man.  It is an odd-looking bird, with a head andbeak that are much too large for its body.  In time man will exterminatethe rest of the wild creatures of Australia, but this one will probablysurvive, for man is his friend and lets him alone.  Man always has a goodreason for his charities towards wild things, human or animal when he hasany.  In this case the bird is spared because he kills snakes.  If L. J.he will not kill all of them.
In that garden I also saw the wild Australian dog--the dingo.  He was abeautiful creature--shapely, graceful, a little wolfish in some of hisaspects, but with a most friendly eye and sociable disposition.  Thedingo is not an importation; he was present in great force when thewhites first came to the continent.  It may be that he is the oldest dogin the universe; his origin, his descent, the place where his ancestorsfirst appeared, are as unknown and as untraceable as are the camel's.He is the most precious dog in the world, for he does not bark.  But inan evil hour he got to raiding the sheep-runs to appease his hunger, andthat sealed his doom.  He is hunted, now, just as if he were a wolf.He has been sentenced to extermination, and the sentence will be carriedout.  This is all right, and not objectionable.  The world was made forman--the white man.
South Australia is confusingly named.  All of the colonies have asouthern exposure except one--Queensland.  Properly speaking, SouthAustralia is middle Australia.  It extends straight up through the centerof the continent like the middle board in a center-table.  It is 2,000miles high, from south to north, and about a third as wide.  A wee littlespot down in its southeastern corner contains eight or nine-tenths of itspopulation; the other one or two-tenths are elsewhere--as elsewhere asthey could be in the United States with all the country between Denverand Chicago, and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico to scatter over.  There isplenty of room.
A telegraph line stretches straight up north through that 2,000 miles ofwilderness and desert from Adelaide to Port Darwin on the edge of theupper ocean.  South Australia built the line; and did it in 1871-2 whenher population numbered only 185,000.  It was a great work; for therewere no roads, no paths; 1,300 miles of the route had been traversed butonce before by white men; provisions, wire, and poles had to be carriedover immense stretches of desert; wells had to be dug along the route tosupply the men and cattle with water.
A cable had been previously laid from Port Darwin to Java and thence toIndia, and there was telegraphic communication with England from India.And so, if Adelaide could make connection with Port Darwin it meantconnection with the whole world.  The enterprise succeeded.  One couldwatch the London markets daily, now; the profit to the wool-growers ofAustralia was instant and enormous.
A telegram from Melbourne to San Francisco covers approximately 20,000miles--the equivalent of five-sixths of the way around the globe.  It hasto halt along the way a good many times and be repeated; still, butlittle time is lost.  These halts, and the distances between them, arehere tabulated.--[From "Round the Empire." (George R.  Parkin), all butthe last two.]

I was in Adelaide again, some months later, and saw the multitudes gatherin the neighboring city of Glenelg to commemorate the Reading of theProclamation--in 1836--which founded the Province.  If I have at any timecalled it a Colony, I withdraw the discourtesy.  It is not a Colony, itis a Province; and officially so.  Moreover, it is the only one so namedin Australasia.  There was great enthusiasm; it was the Province'snational holiday, its Fourth of July, so to speak.  It is the pre-eminentholiday; and that is saying much, in a country where they seem to have amost un-English mania for holidays.  Mainly they are workingmen'sholidays; for in South Australia the workingman is sovereign; his vote isthe desire of the politician--indeed, it is the very breath of thepolitician's being; the parliament exists to deliver the will of theworkingman, and the government exists to execute it.  The workingman is agreat power everywhere in Australia, but South Australia is his paradise.He has had a hard time in this world, and has earned a paradise.  I amglad he has found it.  The holidays there are frequent enough to bebewildering to the stranger.  I tried to get the hang of the system, butwas not able to do it.
You have seen that the Province is tolerant, religious-wise.  It is sopolitically, also.  One of the speakers at the Commemoration banquet--theMinister of Public Works-was an American, born and reared in New England.There is nothing narrow about the Province, politically, or in any otherway that I know of.  Sixty-four religions and a Yankee cabinet minister.No amount of horse-racing can damn this community.
The mean temperature of the Province is 62 deg.  The death-rate is 13 inthe 1,000--about half what it is in the city of New York, I should think,and New York is a healthy city.  Thirteen is the death-rate for theaverage citizen of the Province, but there seems to be no death-rate forthe old people.  There were people at the Commemoration banquet who couldremember Cromwell.  There were six of them.  These Old Settlers had allbeen present at the original Reading of the Proclamation, in 1536.  Theyshowed signs of the blightings and blastings of time, in their outwardaspect, but they were young within; young and cheerful, and ready totalk; ready to talk, and talk all you wanted; in their turn, and out ofit.  They were down for six speeches, and they made 42.  The governor andthe cabinet and the mayor were down for 42 speeches, and they made 6.They have splendid grit, the Old Settlers, splendid staying power.  Butthey do not hear well, and when they see the mayor going through motionswhich they recognize as the introducing of a speaker, they think they arethe one, and they all get up together, and begin to respond, in the mostanimated way; and the more the mayor gesticulates, and shouts "Sit down!Sit down!" the more they take it for applause, and the more excited andreminiscent and enthusiastic they get; and next, when they see the wholehouse laughing and crying, three of them think it is about the bitterold-time hardships they are describing, and the other three think thelaughter is caused by the jokes they have been uncorking--jokes of thevintage of 1836--and then the way they do go on!  And finally when usherscome and plead, and beg, and gently and reverently crowd them down intotheir seats, they say, "Oh, I'm not tired--I could bang along a week!"and they sit there looking simple and childlike, and gentle, and proud oftheir oratory, and wholly unconscious of what is going on at the otherend of the room.  And so one of the great dignitaries gets a chance, andbegins his carefully prepared speech, impressively and with solemnity--
     "When we, now great and prosperous and powerful, bow our heads in     reverent wonder in the contemplation of those sublimities of energy,     of wisdom, of forethought, of----"
Up come the immortal six again, in a body, with a joyous "Hey, I'vethought of another one!" and at it they go, with might and main, hearingnot a whisper of the pandemonium that salutes them, but taking all thevisible violences for applause, as before, and hammering joyously awaytill the imploring ushers pray them into their seats again.  And a pity,too; for those lovely old boys did so enjoy living their heroic youthover, in these days of their honored antiquity; and certainly the thingsthey had to tell were usually worth the telling and the hearing.
It was a stirring spectacle; stirring in more ways than one, for it wasamazingly funny, and at the same time deeply pathetic; for they had seenso much, these time-worn veterans, end had suffered so much; and hadbuilt so strongly and well, and laid the foundations of theircommonwealth so deep, in liberty and tolerance; and had lived to see thestructure rise to such state and dignity and hear themselves so praisedfor honorable work.
One of these old gentlemen told me some things of interest afterward;things about the aboriginals, mainly.  He thought them intelligent--remarkably so in some directions--and he said that along with theirunpleasant qualities they had some exceedingly good ones; and heconsidered it a great pity that the race had died out.  He instancedtheir invention of the boomerang and the "weet-weet" as evidences oftheir brightness; and as another evidence of it he said he had never seena white man who had cleverness enough to learn to do the miracles withthose two toys that the aboriginals achieved.  He said that even thesmartest whites had been obliged to confess that they could not learn thetrick of the boomerang in perfection; that it had possibilities whichthey could not master.  The white man could not control its motions,could not make it obey him; but the aboriginal could.  He told me somewonderful things--some almost incredible things--which he had seen theblacks do with the boomerang and the weet-weet.  They have been confirmedto me since by other early settlers and by trustworthy books.
It is contended--and may be said to be conceded--that the boomerang wasknown to certain savage tribes in Europe in Roman times.  In support ofthis, Virgil and two other Roman poets are quoted.  It is also contendedthat it was known to the ancient Egyptians.
One of two things either some one with is then apparent: a boomerangarrived in Australia in the days of antiquity before European knowledgeof the thing had been lost, or the Australian aboriginal reinvented it.It will take some time to find out which of these two propositions is thefact.  But there is no hurry.
