From Athens all through the islands of the Grecian Archipelago, we sawlittle but forbidding sea-walls and barren hills, sometimes surmounted bythree or four graceful columns of some ancient temple, lonely anddeserted--a fitting symbol of the desolation that has come upon allGreece in these latter ages. We saw no ploughed fields, very fewvillages, no trees or grass or vegetation of any kind, scarcely, andhardly ever an isolated house. Greece is a bleak, unsmiling desert,without agriculture, manufactures or commerce, apparently. What supportsits poverty-stricken people or its Government, is a mystery.
I suppose that ancient Greece and modern Greece compared, furnish themost extravagant contrast to be found in history. George I., an infantof eighteen, and a scraggy nest of foreign office holders, sit in theplaces of Themistocles, Pericles, and the illustrious scholars andgenerals of the Golden Age of Greece. The fleets that were the wonder ofthe world when the Parthenon was new, are a beggarly handful offishing-smacks now, and the manly people that performed such miracles ofvalor at Marathon are only a tribe of unconsidered slaves to-day. Theclassic Illyssus has gone dry, and so have all the sources of Grecianwealth and greatness. The nation numbers only eight hundred thousandsouls, and there is poverty and misery and mendacity enough among themto furnish forty millions and be liberal about it. Under King Otho therevenues of the State were five millions of dollars--raised from a taxof one-tenth of all the agricultural products of the land (which tenththe farmer had to bring to the royal granaries on pack-mules anydistance not exceeding six leagues) and from extravagant taxes on tradeand commerce. Out of that five millions the small tyrant tried to keepan army of ten thousand men, pay all the hundreds of useless GrandEquerries in Waiting, First Grooms of the Bedchamber, Lord HighChancellors of the Exploded Exchequer, and all the other absurditieswhich these puppy-kingdoms indulge in, in imitation of the greatmonarchies; and in addition he set about building a white marble palaceto cost about five millions itself. The result was, simply: ten intofive goes no times and none over. All these things could not be donewith five millions, and Otho fell into trouble.
The Greek throne, with its unpromising adjuncts of a ragged population ofingenious rascals who were out of employment eight months in the yearbecause there was little for them to borrow and less to confiscate, and awaste of barren hills and weed-grown deserts, went begging for a goodwhile. It was offered to one of Victoria's sons, and afterwards tovarious other younger sons of royalty who had no thrones and were out ofbusiness, but they all had the charity to decline the dreary honor, andveneration enough for Greece's ancient greatness to refuse to mock hersorrowful rags and dirt with a tinsel throne in this day of herhumiliation--till they came to this young Danish George, and he took it.He has finished the splendid palace I saw in the radiant moonlight theother night, and is doing many other things for the salvation of Greece,they say.
We sailed through the barren Archipelago, and into the narrow channelthey sometimes call the Dardanelles and sometimes the Hellespont. Thispart of the country is rich in historic reminiscences, and poor as Saharain every thing else. For instance, as we approached the Dardanelles, wecoasted along the Plains of Troy and past the mouth of the Scamander; wesaw where Troy had stood (in the distance,) and where it does not standnow--a city that perished when the world was young. The poor Trojans areall dead, now. They were born too late to see Noah's ark, and died toosoon to see our menagerie. We saw where Agamemnon's fleets rendezvoused,and away inland a mountain which the map said was Mount Ida. Within theHellespont we saw where the original first shoddy contract mentioned inhistory was carried out, and the "parties of the second part" gentlyrebuked by Xerxes. I speak of the famous bridge of boats which Xerxesordered to be built over the narrowest part of the Hellespont (where itis only two or three miles wide.) A moderate gale destroyed the flimsystructure, and the King, thinking that to publicly rebuke the contractorsmight have a good effect on the next set, called them out before the armyand had them beheaded. In the next ten minutes he let a new contract forthe bridge. It has been observed by ancient writers that the secondbridge was a very good bridge. Xerxes crossed his host of five millionsof men on it, and if it had not been purposely destroyed, it wouldprobably have been there yet. If our Government would rebuke some of ourshoddy contractors occasionally, it might work much good. In theHellespont we saw where Leander and Lord Byron swam across, the one tosee her upon whom his soul's affections were fixed with a devotion thatonly death could impair, and the other merely for a flyer, as Jack says.We had two noted tombs near us, too. On one shore slept Ajax, and on theother Hecuba.
We had water batteries and forts on both sides of the Hellespont, flyingthe crimson flag of Turkey, with its white crescent, and occasionally avillage, and sometimes a train of camels; we had all these to look attill we entered the broad sea of Marmora, and then the land soon fadingfrom view, we resumed euchre and whist once more.
We dropped anchor in the mouth of the Golden Horn at daylight in themorning. Only three or four of us were up to see the great Ottomancapital. The passengers do not turn out at unseasonable hours, as theyused to, to get the earliest possible glimpse of strange foreign cities.They are well over that. If we were lying in sight of the Pyramids ofEgypt, they would not come on deck until after breakfast, now-a-days.
The Golden Horn is a narrow arm of the sea, which branches from theBosporus (a sort of broad river which connects the Marmora and BlackSeas,) and, curving around, divides the city in the middle. Galata andPera are on one side of the Bosporus, and the Golden Horn; Stamboul(ancient Byzantium) is upon the other. On the other bank of the Bosporusis Scutari and other suburbs of Constantinople. This great city containsa million inhabitants, but so narrow are its streets, and so crowdedtogether are its houses, that it does not cover much more than half asmuch ground as New York City. Seen from the anchorage or from a mile orso up the Bosporus, it is by far the handsomest city we have seen. Itsdense array of houses swells upward from the water's edge, and spreadsover the domes of many hills; and the gardens that peep out here andthere, the great globes of the mosques, and the countless minarets thatmeet the eye every where, invest the metropolis with the quaint Orientalaspect one dreams of when he reads books of eastern travel.Constantinople makes a noble picture.
But its attractiveness begins and ends with its picturesqueness. Fromthe time one starts ashore till he gets back again, he execrates it. Theboat he goes in is admirably miscalculated for the service it is builtfor. It is handsomely and neatly fitted up, but no man could handle itwell in the turbulent currents that sweep down the Bosporus from theBlack Sea, and few men could row it satisfactorily even in still water.It is a long, light canoe (caique,) large at one end and tapering to aknife blade at the other. They make that long sharp end the bow, and youcan imagine how these boiling currents spin it about. It has two oars,and sometimes four, and no rudder. You start to go to a given point andyou run in fifty different directions before you get there. First oneoar is backing water, and then the other; it is seldom that both aregoing ahead at once. This kind of boating is calculated to drive animpatient man mad in a week. The boatmen are the awkwardest, thestupidest, and the most unscientific on earth, without question.
Ashore, it was--well, it was an eternal circus. People were thicker thanbees, in those narrow streets, and the men were dressed in all theoutrageous, outlandish, idolatrous, extravagant, thunder-and-lightningcostumes that ever a tailor with the delirium tremens and seven devilscould conceive of. There was no freak in dress too crazy to be indulgedin; no absurdity too absurd to be tolerated; no frenzy in raggeddiabolism too fantastic to be attempted. No two men were dressed alike.It was a wild masquerade of all imaginable costumes--every strugglingthrong in every street was a dissolving view of stunning contrasts. Somepatriarchs wore awful turbans, but the grand mass of the infidel hordewore the fiery red skull-cap they call a fez. All the remainder of theraiment they indulged in was utterly indescribable.
The shops here are mere coops, mere boxes, bath-rooms, closets--any thingyou please to call them--on the first floor. The Turks sit cross-leggedin them, and work and trade and smoke long pipes, and smell like--likeTurks. That covers the ground. Crowding the narrow streets in front ofthem are beggars, who beg forever, yet never collect any thing; andwonderful cripples, distorted out of all semblance of humanity, almost;vagabonds driving laden asses; porters carrying dry-goods boxes as largeas cottages on their backs; peddlers of grapes, hot corn, pumpkin seeds,and a hundred other things, yelling like fiends; and sleeping happily,comfortably, serenely, among the hurrying feet, are the famed dogs ofConstantinople; drifting noiselessly about are squads of Turkish women,draped from chin to feet in flowing robes, and with snowy veils boundabout their heads, that disclose only the eyes and a vague, shadowynotion of their features. Seen moving about, far away in the dim, archedaisles of the Great Bazaar, they look as the shrouded dead must havelooked when they walked forth from their graves amid the storms andthunders and earthquakes that burst upon Calvary that awful night of theCrucifixion. A street in Constantinople is a picture which one ought tosee once--not oftener.
And then there was the goose-rancher--a fellow who drove a hundred geesebefore him about the city, and tried to sell them. He had a pole tenfeet long, with a crook in the end of it, and occasionally a goose wouldbranch out from the flock and make a lively break around the corner, withwings half lifted and neck stretched to its utmost. Did thegoose-merchant get excited? No. He took his pole and reached afterthat goose with unspeakable sang froid--took a hitch round his neck, and"yanked" him back to his place in the flock without an effort. Hesteered his geese with that stick as easily as another man would steer ayawl. A few hours afterward we saw him sitting on a stone at a corner,in the midst of the turmoil, sound asleep in the sun, with his geesesquatting around him, or dodging out of the way of asses and men. Wecame by again, within the hour, and he was taking account of stock, tosee whether any of his flock had strayed or been stolen. The way he didit was unique. He put the end of his stick within six or eight inches ofa stone wall, and made the geese march in single file between it and thewall. He counted them as they went by. There was no dodging thatarrangement.
If you want dwarfs--I mean just a few dwarfs for a curiosity--go toGenoa. If you wish to buy them by the gross, for retail, go to Milan.There are plenty of dwarfs all over Italy, but it did seem to me that inMilan the crop was luxuriant. If you would see a fair average style ofassorted cripples, go to Naples, or travel through the Roman States.But if you would see the very heart and home of cripples and humanmonsters, both, go straight to Constantinople. A beggar in Naples whocan show a foot which has all run into one horrible toe, with oneshapeless nail on it, has a fortune--but such an exhibition as that wouldnot provoke any notice in Constantinople. The man would starve. Whowould pay any attention to attractions like his among the rare monstersthat throng the bridges of the Golden Horn and display their deformitiesin the gutters of Stamboul? O, wretched impostor! How could he standagainst the three-legged woman, and the man with his eye in his cheek?How would he blush in presence of the man with fingers on his elbow?Where would he hide himself when the dwarf with seven fingers on eachhand, no upper lip, and his under-jaw gone, came down in his majesty?Bismillah! The cripples of Europe are a delusion and a fraud. The trulygifted flourish only in the by-ways of Pera and Stamboul.
That three-legged woman lay on the bridge, with her stock in trade sodisposed as to command the most striking effect--one natural leg, and twolong, slender, twisted ones with feet on them like somebody else'sfore-arm. Then there was a man further along who had no eyes, and whoseface was the color of a fly-blown beefsteak, and wrinkled and twistedlike a lava-flow--and verily so tumbled and distorted were his featuresthat no man could tell the wart that served him for a nose from hischeek-bones. In Stamboul was a man with a prodigious head, an uncommonlylong body, legs eight inches long and feet like snow-shoes. He traveledon those feet and his hands, and was as sway-backed as if the Colossusof Rhodes had been riding him. Ah, a beggar has to have exceedinglygood points to make a living in Constantinople. A blue-faced man, whohad nothing to offer except that he had been blown up in a mine, wouldbe regarded as a rank impostor, and a mere damaged soldier on crutcheswould never make a cent. It would pay him to get apiece of his headtaken off, and cultivate a wen like a carpet sack.
The Mosque of St. Sophia is the chief lion of Constantinople. You mustget a firman and hurry there the first thing. We did that. We did notget a firman, but we took along four or five francs apiece, which is muchthe same thing.
I do not think much of the Mosque of St. Sophia. I suppose I lackappreciation. We will let it go at that. It is the rustiest old barn inheathendom. I believe all the interest that attaches to it comes fromthe fact that it was built for a Christian church and then turned into amosque, without much alteration, by the Mohammedan conquerors of theland. They made me take off my boots and walk into the place in mystocking-feet. I caught cold, and got myself so stuck up with acomplication of gums, slime and general corruption, that I wore out morethan two thousand pair of boot-jacks getting my boots off that night, andeven then some Christian hide peeled off with them. I abate not a singleboot-jack.
St. Sophia is a colossal church, thirteen or fourteen hundred years old,and unsightly enough to be very, very much older. Its immense dome issaid to be more wonderful than St. Peter's, but its dirt is much morewonderful than its dome, though they never mention it. The church has ahundred and seventy pillars in it, each a single piece, and all of costlymarbles of various kinds, but they came from ancient temples at Baalbec,Heliopolis, Athens and Ephesus, and are battered, ugly and repulsive.They were a thousand years old when this church was new, and then thecontrast must have been ghastly--if Justinian's architects did not trimthem any. The inside of the dome is figured all over with a monstrousinscription in Turkish characters, wrought in gold mosaic, that looks asglaring as a circus bill; the pavements and the marble balustrades areall battered and dirty; the perspective is marred every where by a web ofropes that depend from the dizzy height of the dome, and suspendcountless dingy, coarse oil lamps, and ostrich-eggs, six or seven feetabove the floor. Squatting and sitting in groups, here and there and farand near, were ragged Turks reading books, hearing sermons, or receivinglessons like children. And in fifty places were more of the same sortbowing and straightening up, bowing again and getting down to kiss theearth, muttering prayers the while, and keeping up their gymnastics tillthey ought to have been tired, if they were not.
Every where was dirt, and dust, and dinginess, and gloom; every wherewere signs of a hoary antiquity, but with nothing touching or beautifulabout it; every where were those groups of fantastic pagans; overhead thegaudy mosaics and the web of lamp-ropes--nowhere was there any thing towin one's love or challenge his admiration.
The people who go into ecstasies over St. Sophia must surely get them outof the guide-book (where every church is spoken of as being "consideredby good judges to be the most marvelous structure, in many respects, thatthe world has ever seen.") Or else they are those old connoisseurs fromthe wilds of New Jersey who laboriously learn the difference between afresco and a fire-plug and from that day forward feel privileged to voidtheir critical bathos on painting, sculpture and architecture forevermore.
We visited the Dancing Dervishes. There were twenty-one of them. Theywore a long, light-colored loose robe that hung to their heels. Each inhis turn went up to the priest (they were all within a large circularrailing) and bowed profoundly and then went spinning away deliriously andtook his appointed place in the circle, and continued to spin. When allhad spun themselves to their places, they were about five or six feetapart--and so situated, the entire circle of spinning pagans spun itselfthree separate times around the room. It took twenty-five minutes to doit. They spun on the left foot, and kept themselves going by passing theright rapidly before it and digging it against the waxed floor. Some ofthem made incredible "time." Most of them spun around forty times in aminute, and one artist averaged about sixty-one times a minute, and keptit up during the whole twenty-five. His robe filled with air and stoodout all around him like a balloon.
They made no noise of any kind, and most of them tilted their heads backand closed their eyes, entranced with a sort of devotional ecstacy.There was a rude kind of music, part of the time, but the musicians werenot visible. None but spinners were allowed within the circle. A manhad to either spin or stay outside. It was about as barbarous anexhibition as we have witnessed yet. Then sick persons came and laydown, and beside them women laid their sick children (one a babe at thebreast,) and the patriarch of the Dervishes walked upon their bodies. Hewas supposed to cure their diseases by trampling upon their breasts orbacks or standing on the back of their necks. This is well enough for apeople who think all their affairs are made or marred by viewless spiritsof the air--by giants, gnomes, and genii--and who still believe, to thisday, all the wild tales in the Arabian Nights. Even so an intelligentmissionary tells me.
We visited the Thousand and One Columns. I do not know what it wasoriginally intended for, but they said it was built for a reservoir. Itis situated in the centre of Constantinople. You go down a flight ofstone steps in the middle of a barren place, and there you are. You areforty feet under ground, and in the midst of a perfect wilderness oftall, slender, granite columns, of Byzantine architecture. Stand whereyou would, or change your position as often as you pleased, you werealways a centre from which radiated a dozen long archways and colonnadesthat lost themselves in distance and the sombre twilight of the place.This old dried-up reservoir is occupied by a few ghostly silk-spinnersnow, and one of them showed me a cross cut high up in one of the pillars.I suppose he meant me to understand that the institution was there beforethe Turkish occupation, and I thought he made a remark to that effect;but he must have had an impediment in his speech, for I did notunderstand him.
We took off our shoes and went into the marble mausoleum of the SultanMahmoud, the neatest piece of architecture, inside, that I have seenlately. Mahmoud's tomb was covered with a black velvet pall, which waselaborately embroidered with silver; it stood within a fancy silverrailing; at the sides and corners were silver candlesticks that wouldweigh more than a hundred pounds, and they supported candles as large asa man's leg; on the top of the sarcophagus was a fez, with a handsomediamond ornament upon it, which an attendant said cost a hundred thousandpounds, and lied like a Turk when he said it. Mahmoud's whole familywere comfortably planted around him.
We went to the great Bazaar in Stamboul, of course, and I shall notdescribe it further than to say it is a monstrous hive of little shops--thousands, I should say--all under one roof, and cut up into innumerablelittle blocks by narrow streets which are arched overhead. One street isdevoted to a particular kind of merchandise, another to another, and soon.
When you wish to buy a pair of shoes you have the swing of the wholestreet--you do not have to walk yourself down hunting stores in differentlocalities. It is the same with silks, antiquities, shawls, etc. Theplace is crowded with people all the time, and as the gay-colored Easternfabrics are lavishly displayed before every shop, the great Bazaar ofStamboul is one of the sights that are worth seeing. It is full of life,and stir, and business, dirt, beggars, asses, yelling peddlers, porters,dervishes, high-born Turkish female shoppers, Greeks, and weird-lookingand weirdly dressed Mohammedans from the mountains and the far provinces--and the only solitary thing one does not smell when he is in the GreatBazaar, is something which smells good.
