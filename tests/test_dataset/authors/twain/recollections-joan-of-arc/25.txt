Sweet Fruit of Bitter Truth
WHEN WE got home, breakfast for us minor fry was waiting in our mess-roomand the family honored us by coming in to eat it with us. The nice oldtreasurer, and in fact all three were flatteringly eager to hear aboutour adventures. Nobody asked the Paladin to begin, but he did begin,because now that his specially ordained and peculiar military rank sethim above everybody on the personal staff but old D'Aulon, who didn't eatwith us, he didn't care a farthing for the knights' nobility no mine, buttook precedence in the talk whenever it suited him, which was all thetime, because he was born that way. He said:
"God be thanked, we found the army in admirable condition I think I havenever seen a finer body of animals."
"Animals!" said Miss Catherine.
"I will explain to you what he means," said Noel. "He--"
"I will trouble you not to trouble yourself to explain anything for me,"said the Paladin, loftily. "I have reason to think--"
"That is his way," said Noel; "always when he thinks he has reason tothink, he thinks he does think, but this is an error. He didn't see thearmy. I noticed him, and he didn't see it. He was troubled by his oldcomplaint."
"What s his old complaint?" Catherine asked.
"Prudence," I said, seeing my chance to help.
But it was not a fortunate remark, for the Paladin said:
"It probably isn't your turn to criticize people's prudence--you who fallout of the saddle when a donkey brays."
They all laughed, and I was ashamed of myself for my hasty smartness. Isaid:
"It isn't quite fair for you to say I fell out on account of the donkey'sbraying. It was emotion, just ordinary emotion."
"Very well, if you want to call it that, I am not objecting. What wouldyou call it, Sir Bertrand?"
"Well, it--well, whatever it was, it was excusable, I think. All of youhave learned how to behave in hot hand-to-hand engagements, and you don'tneed to be ashamed of your record in that matter; but to walk along infront of death, with one's hands idle, and no noise, no music, andnothing going on, is a very trying situation. If I were you, De Conte, Iwould name the emotion; it's nothing to be ashamed of."
It was as straight and sensible a speech as ever I heard, and I wasgrateful for the opening it gave me; so I came out and said:
"It was fear--and thank you for the honest idea, too."
"It was the cleanest and best way out," said the old treasurer; "you'vedone well, my lad."
That made me comfortable, and when Miss Catherine said, "It's what Ithink, too," I was grateful to myself for getting into that scrape.
Sir Jean de Metz said:
"We were all in a body together when the donkey brayed, and it wasdismally still at the time. I don't see how any young campaigner couldescape some little touch of that emotion."
He looked about him with a pleasant expression of inquiry on his goodface, and as each pair of eyes in turn met his head they were in nodded aconfession. Even the Paladin delivered his nod. That surprised everybody,and saved the Standard-Bearer's credit. It was clever of him; nobodybelieved he could tell the truth that way without practice, or would tellthat particular sort of a truth either with or without practice. Isuppose he judged it would favorably impress the family. Then the oldtreasurer said:
"Passing the forts in that trying way required the same sort of nervethat a person must have when ghosts are about him in the dark, I shouldthink. What does the Standard-Bearer think?"
"Well, I don't quite know about that, sir. I've often thought I wouldlike to see a ghost if I--"
"Would you?" exclaimed the young lady. "We've got one! Would you try thatone? Will you?"
She was so eager and pretty that the Paladin said straight out that hewould; and then as none of the rest had bravery enough to expose the fearthat was in him, one volunteered after the other with a prompt mouth anda sick heart till all were shipped for the voyage; then the girl clappedher hands in glee, and the parents were gratified, too, saying that theghosts of their house had been a dread and a misery to them and theirforebears for generations, and nobody had ever been found yet who waswilling to confront them and find out what their trouble was, so that thefamily could heal it and content the poor specters and beguile them totranquillity and peace.
