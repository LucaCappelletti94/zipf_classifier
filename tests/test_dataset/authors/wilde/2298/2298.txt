Against these turbid turquoise skiesThe light and luminous balloonsDip and drift like satin moons,Drift like silken butterflies;
Reel with every windy gust,Rise and reel like dancing girls,Float like strange transparent pearls,Fall and float like silver dust.
Now to the low leaves they cling,Each with coy fantastic pose,Each a petal of a roseStraining at a gossamer string.
Then to the tall trees they climb,Like thin globes of amethyst,Wandering opals keeping trystWith the rubies of the lime.
