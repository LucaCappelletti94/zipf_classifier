Presently a command was given, and immediately all livingcreatures vanished from the steps.  Now the air was heavy with thehush of suspense and expectancy.  As far as one's vision couldcarry, he might see the myriads of people in the boats rise up,and shade their eyes from the glare of lanterns and torches, andgaze toward the palace.
A file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps.  Theywere richly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns wereelaborately carved.  Some of them were decorated with banners andstreamers; some with cloth-of-gold and arras embroidered withcoats-of-arms; others with silken flags that had numberless littlesilver bells fastened to them, which shook out tiny showers ofjoyous music whenever the breezes fluttered them; others of yethigher pretensions, since they belonged to nobles in the prince'simmediate service, had their sides picturesquely fenced withshields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings.  Each statebarge was towed by a tender.  Besides the rowers, these tenderscarried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet andbreastplate, and a company of musicians.
The advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in thegreat gateway, a troop of halberdiers.  'They were dressed instriped hose of black and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sideswith silver roses, and doublets of murrey and blue cloth,embroidered on the front and back with the three feathers, theprince's blazon, woven in gold.  Their halberd staves were coveredwith crimson velvet, fastened with gilt nails, and ornamented withgold tassels.  Filing off on the right and left, they formed twolong lines, extending from the gateway of the palace to thewater's edge.  A thick rayed cloth or carpet was then unfolded,and laid down between them by attendants in the gold-and-crimsonliveries of the prince.  This done, a flourish of trumpetsresounded from within.  A lively prelude arose from the musicianson the water; and two ushers with white wands marched with a slowand stately pace from the portal.  They were followed by anofficer bearing the civic mace, after whom came another carryingthe city's sword; then several sergeants of the city guard, intheir full accoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; thenthe Garter King-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights ofthe Bath, each with a white lace on his sleeve; then theiresquires; then the judges, in their robes of scarlet and coifs;then the Lord High Chancellor of England, in a robe of scarlet,open before, and purfled with minever; then a deputation ofaldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the heads of thedifferent civic companies, in their robes of state.  Now cametwelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting ofpourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles ofcrimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation colouredhauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps.  They wereof the suite of the French ambassador, and were followed by twelvecavaliers of the suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in blackvelvet, unrelieved by any ornament.  Following these came severalgreat English nobles with their attendants.'
There was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince's uncle,the future great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway,arrayed in a 'doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak ofcrimson satin flowered with gold, and ribanded with nets ofsilver.'  He turned, doffed his plumed cap, bent his body in a lowreverence, and began to step backward, bowing at each step.  Aprolonged trumpet-blast followed, and a proclamation, "Way for thehigh and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of Wales!"  High aloft onthe palace walls a long line of red tongues of flame leapt forthwith a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river burst into amighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero of itall, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head.
He was 'magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with afront-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, andedged with ermine.  Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced with the triple-feathered crest, lined with bluesatin, set with pearls and precious stones, and fastened with aclasp of brilliants.  About his neck hung the order of the Garter,and several princely foreign orders;' and wherever light fell uponhim jewels responded with a blinding flash.  O Tom Canty, born ina hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar with rags anddirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!
