Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
In one of those Benares temples we saw a devotee working for salvation ina curious way. He had a huge wad of clay beside him and was making it upinto little wee gods no bigger than carpet tacks. He stuck a grain ofrice into each--to represent the lingam, I think. He turned them outnimbly, for he had had long practice and had acquired great facility.Every day he made 2,000 gods, then threw them into the holy Ganges. Thisact of homage brought him the profound homage of the pious--also theircoppers. He had a sure living here, and was earning a high place in thehereafter.
The Ganges front is the supreme show-place of Benares. Its tall bluffsare solidly caked from water to summit, along a stretch of three miles,with a splendid jumble of massive and picturesque masonry, a bewilderingand beautiful confusion of stone platforms, temples, stair-flights, richand stately palaces--nowhere a break, nowhere a glimpse of the bluffitself; all the long face of it is compactly walled from sight by thiscrammed perspective of platforms, soaring stairways, sculptured temples,majestic palaces, softening away into the distances; and there ismovement, motion, human life everywhere, and brilliantly costumed--streaming in rainbows up and down the lofty stairways, and massed inmetaphorical flower-gardens on the miles of great platforms at theriver's edge.
All this masonry, all this architecture represents piety. The palaceswere built by native princes whose homes, as a rule, are far fromBenares, but who go there from time to time to refresh their souls withthe sight and touch of the Ganges, the river of their idolatry. Thestairways are records of acts of piety; the crowd of costly littletemples are tokens of money spent by rich men for present credit and hopeof future reward. Apparently, the rich Christian who spends large sumsupon his religion is conspicuous with us, by his rarity, but the richHindoo who doesn't spend large sums upon his religion is seeminglynon-existent. With us the poor spend money on their religion, but theykeep back some to live on. Apparently, in India, the poor bankruptthemselves daily for their religion. The rich Hindoo can afford hispious outlays; he gets much glory for his spendings, yet keeps back asufficiency of his income for temporal purposes; but the poor Hindoo isentitled to compassion, for his spendings keep him poor, yet get him noglory.
We made the usual trip up and down the river, seated in chairs under anawning on the deck of the usual commodious hand-propelled ark; made ittwo or three times, and could have made it with increasing interest andenjoyment many times more; for, of course, the palaces and temples wouldgrow more and more beautiful every time one saw them, for that happenswith all such things; also, I think one would not get tired of thebathers, nor their costumes, nor of their ingenuities in getting out ofthem and into them again without exposing too much bronze, nor of theirdevotional gesticulations and absorbed bead-tellings.
But I should get tired of seeing them wash their mouths with thatdreadful water and drink it. In fact, I did get tired of it, and veryearly, too. At one place where we halted for a while, the foul gush froma sewer was making the water turbid and murky all around, and there was arandom corpse slopping around in it that had floated down from upcountry. Ten steps below that place stood a crowd of men, women, andcomely young maidens waist deep in the water-and they were scooping it upin their hands and drinking it. Faith can certainly do wonders, and thisis an instance of it. Those people were not drinking that fearful stuffto assuage thirst, but in order to purify their souls and the interior oftheir bodies. According to their creed, the Ganges water makeseverything pure that it touches--instantly and utterly pure. The sewerwater was not an offence to them, the corpse did not revolt them; thesacred water had touched both, and both were now snow-pure, and coulddefile no one. The memory of that sight will always stay by me; but notby request.
A word further concerning the nasty but all-purifying Ganges water. Whenwe went to Agra, by and by, we happened there just in time to be in atthe birth of a marvel--a memorable scientific discovery--the discoverythat in certain ways the foul and derided Ganges water is the mostpuissant purifier in the world! This curious fact, as I have said, hadjust been added to the treasury of modern science. It had long beennoted as a strange thing that while Benares is often afflicted with thecholera she does not spread it beyond her borders. This could not beaccounted for. Mr. Henkin, the scientist in the employ of the governmentof Agra, concluded to examine the water. He went to Benares and made histests. He got water at the mouths of the sewers where they empty intothe river at the bathing ghats; a cubic centimetre of it containedmillions of germs; at the end of six hours they were all dead. He caughta floating corpse, towed it to the shore, and from beside it he dipped upwater that was swarming with cholera germs; at the end of six hours theywere all dead. He added swarm after swarm of cholera germs to thiswater; within the six hours they always died, to the last sample.Repeatedly, he took pure well water which was bare of animal life, andput into it a few cholera germs; they always began to propagate at once,and always within six hours they swarmed--and were numberable by millionsupon millions.
For ages and ages the Hindoos have had absolute faith that the water ofthe Ganges was absolutely pure, could not be defiled by any contactwhatsoever, and infallibly made pure and clean whatsoever thing touchedit. They still believe it, and that is why they bathe in it and drinkit, caring nothing for its seeming filthiness and the floating corpses.The Hindoos have been laughed at, these many generations, but thelaughter will need to modify itself a little from now on. How didthey find out the water's secret in those ancient ages? Had theygerm-scientists then? We do not know. We only know that they had acivilization long before we emerged from savagery. But to return towhere I was before; I was about to speak of the burning-ghat.
They do not burn fakeers--those revered mendicants. They are so holythat they can get to their place without that sacrament, provided they beconsigned to the consecrating river. We saw one carried to mid-streamand thrown overboard. He was sandwiched between two great slabs ofstone.
We lay off the cremation-ghat half an hour and saw nine corpses burned.I should not wish to see any more of it, unless I might select theparties. The mourners follow the bier through the town and down to theghat; then the bier-bearers deliver the body to some low-caste natives--Doms--and the mourners turn about and go back home. I heard no cryingand saw no tears, there was no ceremony of parting. Apparently, theseexpressions of grief and affection are reserved for the privacy of thehome. The dead women came draped in red, the men in white. They arelaid in the water at the river's edge while the pyre is being prepared.
The first subject was a man. When the Doms unswathed him to wash him, heproved to be a sturdily built, well-nourished and handsome old gentleman,with not a sign about him to suggest that he had ever been ill. Dry woodwas brought and built up into a loose pile; the corpse was laid upon itand covered over with fuel. Then a naked holy man who was sitting onhigh ground a little distance away began to talk and shout with greatenergy, and he kept up this noise right along. It may have been thefuneral sermon, and probably was. I forgot to say that one of themourners remained behind when the others went away. This was the deadman's son, a boy of ten or twelve, brown and handsome, grave andself-possessed, and clothed in flowing white. He was there to burn hisfather. He was given a torch, and while he slowly walked seven timesaround the pyre the naked black man on the high ground poured out hissermon more clamorously than ever. The seventh circuit completed, theboy applied the torch at his father's head, then at his feet; the flamessprang briskly up with a sharp crackling noise, and the lad went away.Hindoos do not want daughters, because their weddings make such a ruinousexpense; but they want sons, so that at death they may have honorableexit from the world; and there is no honor equal to the honor of havingone's pyre lighted by one's son. The father who dies sonless is in agrievous situation indeed, and is pitied. Life being uncertain, theHindoo marries while he is still a boy, in the hope that he will have ason ready when the day of his need shall come. But if he have no son, hewill adopt one. This answers every purpose.
Meantime the corpse is burning, also several others. It is a dismalbusiness. The stokers did not sit down in idleness, but moved brisklyabout, punching up the fires with long poles, and now and then addingfuel. Sometimes they hoisted the half of a skeleton into the air, thenslammed it down and beat it with the pole, breaking it up so that itwould burn better. They hoisted skulls up in the same way and banged andbattered them. The sight was hard to bear; it would have been harder ifthe mourners had stayed to witness it. I had but a moderate desire tosee a cremation, so it was soon satisfied. For sanitary reasons it wouldbe well if cremation were universal; but this form is revolting, and notto be recommended.
The fire used is sacred, of course--for there is money in it. Ordinaryfire is forbidden; there is no money in it. I was told that this sacredfire is all furnished by one person, and that he has a monopoly of it andcharges a good price for it. Sometimes a rich mourner pays a thousandrupees for it. To get to paradise from India is an expensive thing.Every detail connected with the matter costs something, and helps tofatten a priest. I suppose it is quite safe to conclude that thatfire-bug is in holy orders.
Close to the cremation-ground stand a few time-worn stones which areremembrances of the suttee. Each has a rough carving upon it,representing a man and a woman standing or walking hand in hand, andmarks the spot where a widow went to her death by fire in the days whenthe suttee flourished. Mr. Parker said that widows would burn themselvesnow if the government would allow it. The family that can point to oneof these little memorials and say: "She who burned herself there was anancestress of ours," is envied.
It is a curious people. With them, all life seems to be sacred excepthuman life. Even the life of vermin is sacred, and must not be taken.The good Jain wipes off a seat before using it, lest he cause the deathof-some valueless insect by sitting down on it. It grieves him to haveto drink water, because the provisions in his stomach may not agree withthe microbes. Yet India invented Thuggery and the Suttee. India is ahard country to understand. We went to the temple of the Thug goddess,Bhowanee, or Kali, or Durga. She has these names and others. She is theonly god to whom living sacrifices are made. Goats are sacrificed toher. Monkeys would be cheaper. There are plenty of them about theplace. Being sacred, they make themselves very free, and scramble aroundwherever they please. The temple and its porch are beautifully carved,but this is not the case with the idol. Bhowanee is not pleasant to lookat. She has a silver face, and a projecting swollen tongue painted adeep red. She wears a necklace of skulls.
In fact, none of the idols in Benares are handsome or attractive. Andwhat a swarm of them there is! The town is a vast museum of idols--andall of them crude, misshapen, and ugly. They flock through one's dreamsat night, a wild mob of nightmares. When you get tired of them in thetemples and take a trip on the river, you find idol giants, flashilypainted, stretched out side by side on the shore. And apparentlywherever there is room for one more lingam, a lingam is there. If Vishnuhad foreseen what his town was going to be, he would have called itIdolville or Lingamburg.
The most conspicuous feature of Benares is the pair of slender whiteminarets which tower like masts from the great Mosque of Aurangzeb. Theyseem to be always in sight, from everywhere, those airy, graceful,inspiring things. But masts is not the right word, for masts have aperceptible taper, while these minarets have not. They are 142 feethigh, and only 8 1/2 feet in diameter at the base, and 7 1/2 at thesummit--scarcely any taper at all. These are the proportions of acandle; and fair and fairylike candles these are. Will be, anyway, someday, when the Christians inherit them and top them with the electriclight. There is a great view from up there--a wonderful view. A largegray monkey was part of it, and damaged it. A monkey has no judgment.This one was skipping about the upper great heights of the mosque--skipping across empty yawning intervals which were almost too wide forhim, and which he only just barely cleared, each time, by the skin of histeeth. He got me so nervous that I couldn't look at the view. Icouldn't look at anything but him. Every time he went sailing over oneof those abysses my breath stood still, and when he grabbed for the perchhe was going for, I grabbed too, in sympathy. And he was perfectlyindifferent, perfectly unconcerned, and I did all the panting myself.He came within an ace of losing his life a dozen times, and I was sotroubled about him that I would have shot him if I had had anything to doit with. But I strongly recommend the view. There is more monkey thanview, and there is always going to be more monkey while that idiotsurvives, but what view you get is superb. All Benares, the river, andthe region round about are spread before you. Take a gun, and look atthe view.
The next thing I saw was more reposeful. It was a new kind of art. Itwas a picture painted on water. It was done by a native. He sprinkledfine dust of various colors on the still surface of a basin of water, andout of these sprinklings a dainty and pretty picture gradually grew, apicture which a breath could destroy. Somehow it was impressive, afterso much browsing among massive and battered and decaying fanes that restupon ruins, and those ruins upon still other ruins, and those upon stillothers again. It was a sermon, an allegory, a symbol of Instability.Those creations in stone were only a kind of water pictures, after all.
A prominent episode in the Indian career of Warren Hastings had Benaresfor its theater. Wherever that extraordinary man set his foot, he lefthis mark. He came to Benares in 1781 to collect a fine of L500,000 whichhe had levied upon its Rajah, Cheit Singly on behalf of the East IndiaCompany. Hastings was a long way from home and help. There were,probably, not a dozen Englishmen within reach; the Rajah was in his fortwith his myriads around him. But no matter. From his little camp in aneighboring garden, Hastings sent a party to arrest the sovereign. Hesent on this daring mission a couple of hundred native soldiers sepoys--under command of three young English lieutenants. The Rajah submittedwithout a word. The incident lights up the Indian situationelectrically, and gives one a vivid sense of the strides which theEnglish had made and the mastership they had acquired in the land sincethe date of Clive's great victory. In a quarter of a century, from beingnobodies, and feared by none, they were become confessed lords andmasters, feared by all, sovereigns included, and served by all,sovereigns included. It makes the fairy tales sound true. The Englishhad not been afraid to enlist native soldiers to fight against their ownpeople and keep them obedient. And now Hastings was not afraid to comeaway out to this remote place with a handful of such soldiers and sendthem to arrest a native sovereign.
The lieutenants imprisoned the Rajah in his own fort. It was beautiful,the pluckiness of it, the impudence of it. The arrest enraged theRajah's people, and all Benares came storming about the place andthreatening vengeance. And yet, but for an accident, nothing importantwould have resulted, perhaps. The mob found out a most strange thing, analmost incredible thing--that this handful of soldiers had come on thishardy errand with empty guns and no ammunition. This has been attributedto thoughtlessness, but it could hardly have been that, for in such largeemergencies as this, intelligent people do think. It must have beenindifference, an over-confidence born of the proved submissiveness of thenative character, when confronted by even one or two stern Britons intheir war paint. But, however that may be, it was a fatal discovery thatthe mob had made. They were full of courage, now, and they broke intothe fort and massacred the helpless soldiers and their officers.Hastings escaped from Benares by night and got safely away, leaving theprincipality in a state of wild insurrection; but he was back againwithin the month, and quieted it down in his prompt and virile way, andtook the Rajah's throne away from him and gave it to another man. He wasa capable kind of person was Warren Hastings. This was the only time hewas ever out of ammunition. Some of his acts have left stains upon hisname which can never be washed away, but he saved to England the IndianEmpire, and that was the best service that was ever done to the Indiansthemselves, those wretched heirs of a hundred centuries of pitilessoppression and abuse.
