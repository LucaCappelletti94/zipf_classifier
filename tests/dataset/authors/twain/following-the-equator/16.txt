There is a Moral sense, and there is an Immoral Sense. History shows usthat the Moral Sense enables us to perceive morality and how to avoid it,and that the Immoral Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how toenjoy it. -Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
Melbourne spreads around over an immense area of ground. It is a statelycity architecturally as well as in magnitude. It has an elaborate systemof cable-car service; it has museums, and colleges, and schools, andpublic gardens, and electricity, and gas, and libraries, and theaters,and mining centers, and wool centers, and centers of the arts andsciences, and boards of trade, and ships, and railroads, and a harbor,and social clubs, and journalistic clubs, and racing clubs, and asquatter club sumptuously housed and appointed, and as many churches andbanks as can make a living. In a word, it is equipped with everythingthat goes to make the modern great city. It is the largest city ofAustralasia, and fills the post with honor and credit. It has onespecialty; this must not be jumbled in with those other things. It isthe mitred Metropolitan of the Horse-Racing Cult. Its race-ground is theMecca of Australasia. On the great annual day of sacrifice--the 5th ofNovember, Guy Fawkes's Day--business is suspended over a stretch of landand sea as wide as from New York to San Francisco, and deeper than fromthe northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico; and every man and woman, ofhigh degree or low, who can afford the expense, put away their otherduties and come. They begin to swarm in by ship and rail a fortnightbefore the day, and they swarm thicker and thicker day after day, untilall the vehicles of transportation are taxed to their uttermost to meetthe demands of the occasion, and all hotels and lodgings are bulgingoutward because of the pressure from within. They come a hundredthousand strong, as all the best authorities say, and they pack thespacious grounds and grandstands and make a spectacle such as is never tobe seen in Australasia elsewhere.
It is the "Melbourne Cup" that brings this multitude together. Theirclothes have been ordered long ago, at unlimited cost, and without boundsas to beauty and magnificence, and have been kept in concealment untilnow, for unto this day are they consecrate. I am speaking of the ladies'clothes; but one might know that.
And so the grand-stands make a brilliant and wonderful spectacle, adelirium of color, a vision of beauty. The champagne flows, everybody isvivacious, excited, happy; everybody bets, and gloves and fortunes changehands right along, all the time. Day after day the races go on, and thefun and the excitement are kept at white heat; and when each day is done,the people dance all night so as to be fresh for the race in the morning.And at the end of the great week the swarms secure lodgings andtransportation for next year, then flock away to their remote homes andcount their gains and losses, and order next year's Cup-clothes, and thenlie down and sleep two weeks, and get up sorry to reflect that a wholeyear must be put in somehow or other before they can be wholly happyagain.
The Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day. It would bedifficult to overstate its importance. It overshadows all other holidaysand specialized days of whatever sort in that congeries of colonies.Overshadows them? I might almost say it blots them out. Each of themgets attention, but not everybody's; each of them evokes interest, butnot everybody's; each of them rouses enthusiasm, but not everybody's; ineach case a part of the attention, interest, and enthusiasm is a matterof habit and custom, and another part of it is official and perfunctory.Cup Day, and Cup Day only, commands an attention, an interest, and anenthusiasm which are universal--and spontaneous, not perfunctory. CupDay is supreme it has no rival. I can call to mind no specialized annualday, in any country, which can be named by that large name--Supreme. Ican call to mind no specialized annual day, in any country, whoseapproach fires the whole land with a conflagration of conversation andpreparation and anticipation and jubilation. No day save this one; butthis one does it.
In America we have no annual supreme day; no day whose approach makes thewhole nation glad. We have the Fourth of July, and Christmas, andThanksgiving. Neither of them can claim the primacy; neither of them canarouse an enthusiasm which comes near to being universal. Eight grownAmericans out of ten dread the coming of the Fourth, with its pandemoniumand its perils, and they rejoice when it is gone--if still alive. Theapproach of Christmas brings harassment and dread to many excellentpeople. They have to buy a cart-load of presents, and they never knowwhat to buy to hit the various tastes; they put in three weeks of hardand anxious work, and when Christmas morning comes they are sodissatisfied with the result, and so disappointed that they want to sitdown and cry. Then they give thanks that Christmas comes but once ayear. The observance of Thanksgiving Day--as a function--has becomegeneral of late years. The Thankfulness is not so general. This isnatural. Two-thirds of the nation have always had hard luck and a hardtime during the year, and this has a calming effect upon theirenthusiasm.
We have a supreme day--a sweeping and tremendous and tumultuous day, aday which commands an absolute universality of interest and excitement;but it is not annual. It comes but once in four years; therefore itcannot count as a rival of the Melbourne Cup.
In Great Britain and Ireland they have two great days--Christmas and theQueen's birthday. But they are equally popular; there is no supremacy.
I think it must be conceded that the position of the Australasian Day isunique, solitary, unfellowed; and likely to hold that high place a longtime.
The next things which interest us when we travel are, first, the people;next, the novelties; and finally the history of the places and countriesvisited. Novelties are rare in cities which represent the most advancedcivilization of the modern day. When one is familiar with such cities inthe other parts of the world he is in effect familiar with the cities ofAustralasia. The outside aspects will furnish little that is new. Therewill be new names, but the things which they represent will sometimes befound to be less new than their names. There may be shades ofdifference, but these can easily be too fine for detection by theincompetent eye of the passing stranger. In the larrikin he will not beable to discover a new species, but only an old one met elsewhere, andvariously called loafer, rough, tough, bummer, or blatherskite, accordingto his geographical distribution. The larrikin differs by a shade fromthose others, in that he is more sociable toward the stranger than they,more kindly disposed, more hospitable, more hearty, more friendly. Atleast it seemed so to me, and I had opportunity to observe. In Sydney,at least. In Melbourne I had to drive to and from the lecture-theater,but in Sydney I was able to walk both ways, and did it. Every night, onmy way home at ten, or a quarter past, I found the larrikin grouped inconsiderable force at several of the street corners, and he always gaveme this pleasant salutation:
"Hello, Mark!"
"Here's to you, old chap!
"Say--Mark!--is he dead?"--a reference to a passage in some book of mine,though I did not detect, at that time, that that was its source. And Ididn't detect it afterward in Melbourne, when I came on the stage for thefirst time, and the same question was dropped down upon me from the dizzyheight of the gallery. It is always difficult to answer a sudden inquirylike that, when you have come unprepared and don't know what it means.I will remark here--if it is not an indecorum--that the welcome which anAmerican lecturer gets from a British colonial audience is a thing whichwill move him to his deepest deeps, and veil his sight and break hisvoice. And from Winnipeg to Africa, experience will teach him nothing;he will never learn to expect it, it will catch him as a surprise eachtime. The war-cloud hanging black over England and America made notrouble for me. I was a prospective prisoner of war, but at dinners,suppers, on the platform, and elsewhere, there was never anything toremind me of it. This was hospitality of the right metal, and would havebeen prominently lacking in some countries, in the circumstances.
And speaking of the war-flurry, it seemed to me to bring to light theunexpected, in a detail or two. It seemed to relegate the war-talk tothe politicians on both sides of the water; whereas whenever aprospective war between two nations had been in the air theretofore, thepublic had done most of the talking and the bitterest. The attitude ofthe newspapers was new also. I speak of those of Australasia and India,for I had access to those only. They treated the subject argumentativelyand with dignity, not with spite and anger. That was a new spirit, too,and not learned of the French and German press, either before Sedan orsince. I heard many public speeches, and they reflected the moderationof the journals. The outlook is that the English-speaking race willdominate the earth a hundred years from now, if its sections do not getto fighting each other. It would be a pity to spoil that prospect bybaffling and retarding wars when arbitration would settle theirdifferences so much better and also so much more definitely.
No, as I have suggested, novelties are rare in the great capitals ofmodern times. Even the wool exchange in Melbourne could not be told fromthe familiar stock exchange of other countries. Wool brokers are justlike stockbrokers; they all bounce from their seats and put up theirhands and yell in unison--no stranger can tell what--and the presidentcalmly says "Sold to Smith & Co., threpence farthing--next!"--whenprobably nothing of the kind happened; for how should he know?
In the museums you will find acres of the most strange and fascinatingthings; but all museums are fascinating, and they do so tire your eyes,and break your back, and burn out your vitalities with their consuminginterest. You always say you will never go again, but you do go. Thepalaces of the rich, in Melbourne, are much like the palaces of the richin America, and the life in them is the same; but there the resemblanceends. The grounds surrounding the American palace are not often large,and not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case the grounds are oftenducally spacious, and the climate and the gardeners together make them asbeautiful as a dream. It is said that some of the country seats havegrounds--domains--about them which rival in charm and magnitude thosewhich surround the country mansion of an English lord; but I was not outin the country; I had my hands full in town.
And what was the origin of this majestic city and its efflorescence ofpalatial town houses and country seats? Its first brick was laid andits first house built by a passing convict. Australian history is almostalways picturesque; indeed, it is so curious and strange, that it isitself the chiefest novelty the country has to offer, and so it pushesthe other novelties into second and third place. It does not read likehistory, but like the most beautiful lies. And all of a fresh new sort,no mouldy old stale ones. It is full of surprises, and adventures, andincongruities, and contradictions, and incredibilities; but they are alltrue, they all happened.
