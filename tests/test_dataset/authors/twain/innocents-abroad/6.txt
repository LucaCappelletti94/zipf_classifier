I think the Azores must be very little known in America. Out of ourwhole ship's company there was not a solitary individual who knewanything whatever about them. Some of the party, well read concerningmost other lands, had no other information about the Azores than thatthey were a group of nine or ten small islands far out in the Atlantic,something more than halfway between New York and Gibraltar. That wasall. These considerations move me to put in a paragraph of dry factsjust here.
The community is eminently Portuguese--that is to say, it is slow, poor,shiftless, sleepy, and lazy. There is a civil governor, appointed by theKing of Portugal, and also a military governor, who can assume supremecontrol and suspend the civil government at his pleasure. The islandscontain a population of about 200,000, almost entirely Portuguese.Everything is staid and settled, for the country was one hundred yearsold when Columbus discovered America. The principal crop is corn, andthey raise it and grind it just as their great-great-great-grandfathersdid. They plow with a board slightly shod with iron; their triflinglittle harrows are drawn by men and women; small windmills grind thecorn, ten bushels a day, and there is one assistant superintendent tofeed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him fromgoing to sleep. When the wind changes they hitch on some donkeys andactually turn the whole upper half of the mill around until the sails arein proper position, instead of fixing the concern so that the sails couldbe moved instead of the mill. Oxen tread the wheat from the ear, afterthe fashion prevalent in the time of Methuselah. There is not awheelbarrow in the land--they carry everything on their heads, or ondonkeys, or in a wicker-bodied cart, whose wheels are solid blocks ofwood and whose axles turn with the wheel. There is not a modern plow inthe islands or a threshing machine. All attempts to introduce them havefailed. The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God toshield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father didbefore him. The climate is mild; they never have snow or ice, and I sawno chimneys in the town. The donkeys and the men, women, and children ofa family all eat and sleep in the same room, and are unclean, are ravagedby vermin, and are truly happy. The people lie, and cheat the stranger,and are desperately ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for theirdead. The latter trait shows how little better they are than the donkeysthey eat and sleep with. The only well-dressed Portuguese in the campare the half a dozen well-to-do families, the Jesuit priests, and thesoldiers of the little garrison. The wages of a laborer are twenty totwenty-four cents a day, and those of a good mechanic about twice asmuch. They count it in reis at a thousand to the dollar, and this makesthem rich and contented. Fine grapes used to grow in the islands, and anexcellent wine was made and exported. But a disease killed all the vinesfifteen years ago, and since that time no wine has been made. Theislands being wholly of volcanic origin, the soil is necessarily veryrich. Nearly every foot of ground is under cultivation, and two or threecrops a year of each article are produced, but nothing is exported save afew oranges--chiefly to England. Nobody comes here, and nobody goesaway. News is a thing unknown in Fayal. A thirst for it is a passionequally unknown. A Portuguese of average intelligence inquired if ourcivil war was over. Because, he said, somebody had told him it was--orat least it ran in his mind that somebody had told him something likethat! And when a passenger gave an officer of the garrison copies of theTribune, the Herald, and Times, he was surprised to find later news inthem from Lisbon than he had just received by the little monthly steamer.He was told that it came by cable. He said he knew they had tried to laya cable ten years ago, but it had been in his mind somehow that theyhadn't succeeded!
It is in communities like this that Jesuit humbuggery flourishes. Wevisited a Jesuit cathedral nearly two hundred years old and found in it apiece of the veritable cross upon which our Saviour was crucified. Itwas polished and hard, and in as excellent a state of preservation as ifthe dread tragedy on Calvary had occurred yesterday instead of eighteencenturies ago. But these confiding people believe in that piece of woodunhesitatingly.
In a chapel of the cathedral is an altar with facings of solid silver--atleast they call it so, and I think myself it would go a couple of hundredto the ton (to speak after the fashion of the silver miners)--and beforeit is kept forever burning a small lamp. A devout lady who died, leftmoney and contracted for unlimited masses for the repose of her soul, andalso stipulated that this lamp should be kept lighted always, day andnight. She did all this before she died, you understand. It is a verysmall lamp and a very dim one, and it could not work her much damage, Ithink, if it went out altogether.
The great altar of the cathedral and also three or four minor ones are aperfect mass of gilt gimcracks and gingerbread. And they have a swarm ofrusty, dusty, battered apostles standing around the filagree work, someon one leg and some with one eye out but a gamey look in the other, andsome with two or three fingers gone, and some with not enough nose leftto blow--all of them crippled and discouraged, and fitter subjects forthe hospital than the cathedral.
The walls of the chancel are of porcelain, all pictured over with figuresof almost life size, very elegantly wrought and dressed in the fancifulcostumes of two centuries ago. The design was a history of something orsomebody, but none of us were learned enough to read the story. The oldfather, reposing under a stone close by, dated 1686, might have told usif he could have risen. But he didn't.
As we came down through the town we encountered a squad of little donkeysready saddled for use. The saddles were peculiar, to say the least.They consisted of a sort of saw-buck with a small mattress on it, andthis furniture covered about half the donkey. There were no stirrups,but really such supports were not needed--to use such a saddle was thenext thing to riding a dinner table--there was ample support clear out toone's knee joints. A pack of ragged Portuguese muleteers crowded aroundus, offering their beasts at half a dollar an hour--more rascality to thestranger, for the market price is sixteen cents. Half a dozen of usmounted the ungainly affairs and submitted to the indignity of making aridiculous spectacle of ourselves through the principal streets of a townof 10,000 inhabitants.
We started. It was not a trot, a gallop, or a canter, but a stampede,and made up of all possible or conceivable gaits. No spurs werenecessary. There was a muleteer to every donkey and a dozen volunteersbeside, and they banged the donkeys with their goad sticks, and prickedthem with their spikes, and shouted something that sounded like"Sekki-yah!" and kept up a din and a racket that was worse than Bedlamitself. These rascals were all on foot, but no matter, they were alwaysup to time--they can outrun and outlast a donkey. Altogether, ours wasa lively and a picturesque procession, and drew crowded audiences to thebalconies wherever we went.
Blucher could do nothing at all with his donkey. The beast scamperedzigzag across the road and the others ran into him; he scraped Blucheragainst carts and the corners of houses; the road was fenced in with highstone walls, and the donkey gave him a polishing first on one side andthen on the other, but never once took the middle; he finally came to thehouse he was born in and darted into the parlor, scraping Blucher off atthe doorway. After remounting, Blucher said to the muleteer, "Now,that's enough, you know; you go slow hereafter."
But the fellow knew no English and did not understand, so he simply said,"Sekki-yah!" and the donkey was off again like a shot. He turned a cornersuddenly, and Blucher went over his head. And, to speak truly, everymule stumbled over the two, and the whole cavalcade was piled up in aheap. No harm done. A fall from one of those donkeys is of little moreconsequence than rolling off a sofa. The donkeys all stood still afterthe catastrophe and waited for their dismembered saddles to be patched upand put on by the noisy muleteers. Blucher was pretty angry and wantedto swear, but every time he opened his mouth his animal did so also andlet off a series of brays that drowned all other sounds.
It was fun, scurrying around the breezy hills and through the beautifulcanyons. There was that rare thing, novelty, about it; it was a fresh,new, exhilarating sensation, this donkey riding, and worth a hundred wornand threadbare home pleasures.
The roads were a wonder, and well they might be. Here was an island withonly a handful of people in it--25,000--and yet such fine roads do notexist in the United States outside of Central Park. Everywhere you go,in any direction, you find either a hard, smooth, level thoroughfare,just sprinkled with black lava sand, and bordered with little guttersneatly paved with small smooth pebbles, or compactly paved ones likeBroadway. They talk much of the Russ pavement in New York, and call it anew invention--yet here they have been using it in this remote littleisle of the sea for two hundred years! Every street in Horta ishandsomely paved with the heavy Russ blocks, and the surface is neat andtrue as a floor--not marred by holes like Broadway. And every road isfenced in by tall, solid lava walls, which will last a thousand years inthis land where frost is unknown. They are very thick, and are oftenplastered and whitewashed and capped with projecting slabs of cut stone.Trees from gardens above hang their swaying tendrils down, and contrasttheir bright green with the whitewash or the black lava of the walls andmake them beautiful. The trees and vines stretch across these narrowroadways sometimes and so shut out the sun that you seem to be ridingthrough a tunnel. The pavements, the roads, and the bridges are allgovernment work.
The bridges are of a single span--a single arch--of cut stone, without asupport, and paved on top with flags of lava and ornamental pebblework.Everywhere are walls, walls, walls, and all of them tasteful andhandsome--and eternally substantial; and everywhere are those marvelouspavements, so neat, so smooth, and so indestructible. And if ever roadsand streets and the outsides of houses were perfectly free from any signor semblance of dirt, or dust, or mud, or uncleanliness of any kind, itis Horta, it is Fayal. The lower classes of the people, in their personsand their domiciles, are not clean--but there it stops--the town and theisland are miracles of cleanliness.
We arrived home again finally, after a ten-mile excursion, and theirrepressible muleteers scampered at our heels through the main street,goading the donkeys, shouting the everlasting "Sekki-yah," and singing"John Brown's Body" in ruinous English.
When we were dismounted and it came to settling, the shouting and jawingand swearing and quarreling among the muleteers and with us was nearlydeafening. One fellow would demand a dollar an hour for the use of hisdonkey; another claimed half a dollar for pricking him up, another aquarter for helping in that service, and about fourteen guides presentedbills for showing us the way through the town and its environs; and everyvagrant of them was more vociferous, and more vehement and more franticin gesture than his neighbor. We paid one guide and paid for onemuleteer to each donkey.
The mountains on some of the islands are very high. We sailed along theshore of the island of Pico, under a stately green pyramid that rose upwith one unbroken sweep from our very feet to an altitude of 7,613 feet,and thrust its summit above the white clouds like an island adrift in afog!
We got plenty of fresh oranges, lemons, figs, apricots, etc., in theseAzores, of course. But I will desist. I am not here to write PatentOffice reports.
We are on our way to Gibraltar, and shall reach there five or six daysout from the Azores.
