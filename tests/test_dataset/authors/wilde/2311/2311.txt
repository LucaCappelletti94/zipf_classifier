IN my last lecture I gave you something of the history of Art inEngland. I sought to trace the influence of the French Revolutionupon its development. I said something of the song of Keats andthe school of the pre-Raphaelites. But I do not want to shelterthe movement, which I have called the English Renaissance, underany palladium however noble, or any name however revered. Theroots of it have, indeed, to be sought for in things that have longpassed away, and not, as some suppose, in the fancy of a few youngmen - although I am not altogether sure that there is anything muchbetter than the fancy of a few young men.
When I appeared before you on a previous occasion, I had seennothing of American art save the Doric columns and Corinthianchimney-pots visible on your Broadway and Fifth Avenue. Sincethen, I have been through your country to some fifty or sixtydifferent cities, I think. I find that what your people need isnot so much high imaginative art but that which hallows the vesselsof everyday use. I suppose that the poet will sing and the artistwill paint regardless whether the world praises or blames. He hashis own world and is independent of his fellow-men. But thehandicraftsman is dependent on your pleasure and opinion. He needsyour encouragement and he must have beautiful surroundings. Yourpeople love art but do not sufficiently honour the handicraftsman.Of course, those millionaires who can pillage Europe for theirpleasure need have no care to encourage such; but I speak for thosewhose desire for beautiful things is larger than their means. Ifind that one great trouble all over is that your workmen are notgiven to noble designs. You cannot be indifferent to this, becauseArt is not something which you can take or leave. It is anecessity of human life.
And what is the meaning of this beautiful decoration which we callart? In the first place, it means value to the workman and itmeans the pleasure which he must necessarily take in making abeautiful thing. The mark of all good art is not that the thingdone is done exactly or finely, for machinery may do as much, butthat it is worked out with the head and the workman's heart. Icannot impress the point too frequently that beautiful and rationaldesigns are necessary in all work. I did not imagine, until I wentinto some of your simpler cities, that there was so much bad workdone. I found, where I went, bad wall-papers horribly designed,and coloured carpets, and that old offender the horse-hair sofa,whose stolid look of indifference is always so depressing. I foundmeaningless chandeliers and machine-made furniture, generally ofrosewood, which creaked dismally under the weight of the ubiquitousinterviewer. I came across the small iron stove which they alwayspersist in decorating with machine-made ornaments, and which is asgreat a bore as a wet day or any other particularly dreadfulinstitution. When unusual extravagance was indulged in, it wasgarnished with two funeral urns.
It must always be remembered that what is well and carefully madeby an honest workman, after a rational design, increases in beautyand value as the years go on. The old furniture brought over bythe Pilgrims, two hundred years ago, which I saw in New England, isjust as good and as beautiful to-day as it was when it first camehere. Now, what you must do is to bring artists and handicraftsmentogether. Handicraftsmen cannot live, certainly cannot thrive,without such companionship. Separate these two and you rob art ofall spiritual motive.
Having done this, you must place your workman in the midst ofbeautiful surroundings. The artist is not dependent on the visibleand the tangible. He has his visions and his dreams to feed on.But the workman must see lovely forms as he goes to his work in themorning and returns at eventide. And, in connection with this, Iwant to assure you that noble and beautiful designs are never theresult of idle fancy or purposeless day-dreaming. They come onlyas the accumulation of habits of long and delightful observation.And yet such things may not be taught. Right ideas concerning themcan certainly be obtained only by those who have been accustomed torooms that are beautiful and colours that are satisfying.
Perhaps one of the most difficult things for us to do is to choosea notable and joyous dress for men. There would be more joy inlife if we were to accustom ourselves to use all the beautifulcolours we can in fashioning our own clothes. The dress of thefuture, I think, will use drapery to a great extent and will aboundwith joyous colour. At present we have lost all nobility of dressand, in doing so, have almost annihilated the modern sculptor.And, in looking around at the figures which adorn our parks, onecould almost wish that we had completely killed the noble art. Tosee the frock-coat of the drawing-room done in bronze, or thedouble waistcoat perpetuated in marble, adds a new horror to death.But indeed, in looking through the history of costume, seeking ananswer to the questions we have propounded, there is little that iseither beautiful or appropriate. One of the earliest forms is theGreek drapery which is exquisite for young girls. And then, Ithink we may be pardoned a little enthusiasm over the dress of thetime of Charles I., so beautiful indeed, that in spite of itsinvention being with the Cavaliers it was copied by the Puritans.And the dress for the children of that time must not be passedover. It was a very golden age of the little ones. I do not thinkthat they have ever looked so lovely as they do in the pictures ofthat time. The dress of the last century in England is alsopeculiarly gracious and graceful. There is nothing bizarre orstrange about it, but it is full of harmony and beauty. In thesedays, when we have suffered dreadfully from the incursions of themodern milliner, we hear ladies boast that they do not wear a dressmore than once. In the old days, when the dresses were decoratedwith beautiful designs and worked with exquisite embroidery, ladiesrather took a pride in bringing out the garment and wearing it manytimes and handing it down to their daughters - a process thatwould, I think, be quite appreciated by a modern husband whencalled upon to settle his wife's bills.
And how shall men dress? Men say that they do not particularlycare how they dress, and that it is little matter. I am bound toreply that I do not think that you do. In all my journeys throughthe country, the only well-dressed men that I saw - and in sayingthis I earnestly deprecate the polished indignation of your FifthAvenue dandies - were the Western miners. Their wide-brimmed hats,which shaded their faces from the sun and protected them from therain, and the cloak, which is by far the most beautiful piece ofdrapery ever invented, may well be dwelt on with admiration. Theirhigh boots, too, were sensible and practical. They wore only whatwas comfortable, and therefore beautiful. As I looked at them Icould not help thinking with regret of the time when thesepicturesque miners would have made their fortunes and would go Eastto assume again all the abominations of modern fashionable attire.Indeed, so concerned was I that I made some of them promise thatwhen they again appeared in the more crowded scenes of Easterncivilisation they would still continue to wear their lovelycostume. But I do not believe they will.
Now, what America wants to-day is a school of rational art. Badart is a great deal worse than no art at all. You must show yourworkmen specimens of good work so that they come to know what issimple and true and beautiful. To that end I would have you have amuseum attached to these schools - not one of those dreadful moderninstitutions where there is a stuffed and very dusty giraffe, and acase or two of fossils, but a place where there are gatheredexamples of art decoration from various periods and countries.Such a place is the South Kensington Museum in London, whereon webuild greater hopes for the future than on any other one thing.There I go every Saturday night, when the museum is open later thanusual, to see the handicraftsman, the wood-worker, the glass-blowerand the worker in metals. And it is here that the man ofrefinement and culture comes face to face with the workman whoministers to his joy. He comes to know more of the nobility of theworkman, and the workman, feeling the appreciation, comes to knowmore of the nobility of his work.
You have too many white walls. More colour is wanted. You shouldhave such men as Whistler among you to teach you the beauty and joyof colour. Take Mr. Whistler's 'Symphony in White,' which you nodoubt have imagined to be something quite bizarre. It is nothingof the sort. Think of a cool grey sky flecked here and there withwhite clouds, a grey ocean and three wonderfully beautiful figuresrobed in white, leaning over the water and dropping white flowersfrom their fingers. Here is no extensive intellectual scheme totrouble you, and no metaphysics of which we have had quite enoughin art. But if the simple and unaided colour strike the rightkeynote, the whole conception is made clear. I regard Mr.Whistler's famous Peacock Room as the finest thing in colour andart decoration which the world has known since Correggio paintedthat wonderful room in Italy where the little children are dancingon the walls. Mr. Whistler finished another room just before Icame away - a breakfast room in blue and yellow. The ceiling was alight blue, the cabinet-work and the furniture were of a yellowwood, the curtains at the windows were white and worked in yellow,and when the table was set for breakfast with dainty blue chinanothing can be conceived at once so simple and so joyous.
The fault which I have observed in most of your rooms is that thereis apparent no definite scheme of colour. Everything is notattuned to a key-note as it should be. The apartments are crowdedwith pretty things which have no relation to one another. Again,your artists must decorate what is more simply useful. In your artschools I found no attempt to decorate such things as the vesselsfor water. I know of nothing uglier than the ordinary jug orpitcher. A museum could be filled with the different kinds ofwater vessels which are used in hot countries. Yet we continue tosubmit to the depressing jug with the handle all on one side. I donot see the wisdom of decorating dinner-plates with sunsets andsoup-plates with moonlight scenes. I do not think it adds anythingto the pleasure of the canvas-back duck to take it out of suchglories. Besides, we do not want a soup-plate whose bottom seemsto vanish in the distance. One feels neither safe nor comfortableunder such conditions. In fact, I did not find in the art schoolsof the country that the difference was explained between decorativeand imaginative art.
The conditions of art should be simple. A great deal more dependsupon the heart than upon the head. Appreciation of art is notsecured by any elaborate scheme of learning. Art requires a goodhealthy atmosphere. The motives for art are still around about usas they were round about the ancients. And the subjects are alsoeasily found by the earnest sculptor and the painter. Nothing ismore picturesque and graceful than a man at work. The artist whogoes to the children's playground, watches them at their sport andsees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the same themes thatengaged the attention of the ancient Greeks, and such observationand the illustrations which follow will do much to correct thatfoolish impression that mental and physical beauty are alwaysdivorced.
To you, more than perhaps to any other country, has Nature beengenerous in furnishing material for art workers to work in. Youhave marble quarries where the stone is more beautiful in colourthan any the Greeks ever had for their beautiful work, and yet dayafter day I am confronted with the great building of some stupidman who has used the beautiful material as if it were not preciousalmost beyond speech. Marble should not be used save by nobleworkmen. There is nothing which gave me a greater sense ofbarrenness in travelling through the country than the entireabsence of wood carving on your houses. Wood carving is thesimplest of the decorative arts. In Switzerland the littlebarefooted boy beautifies the porch of his father's house withexamples of skill in this direction. Why should not American boysdo a great deal more and better than Swiss boys?
There is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and morevulgar in execution than modern jewellery. This is something thatcan easily be corrected. Something better should be made out ofthe beautiful gold which is stored up in your mountain hollows andstrewn along your river beds. When I was at Leadville andreflected that all the shining silver that I saw coming from themines would be made into ugly dollars, it made me sad. It shouldbe made into something more permanent. The golden gates atFlorence are as beautiful to-day as when Michael Angelo saw them.
We should see more of the workman than we do. We should not becontent to have the salesman stand between us - the salesman whoknows nothing of what he is selling save that he is charging agreat deal too much for it. And watching the workman will teachthat most important lesson - the nobility of all rationalworkmanship.
I said in my last lecture that art would create a new brotherhoodamong men by furnishing a universal language. I said that underits beneficent influences war might pass away. Thinking this, whatplace can I ascribe to art in our education? If children grow upamong all fair and lovely things, they will grow to love beauty anddetest ugliness before they know the reason why. If you go into ahouse where everything is coarse, you find things chipped andbroken and unsightly. Nobody exercises any care. If everything isdainty and delicate, gentleness and refinement of manner areunconsciously acquired. When I was in San Francisco I used tovisit the Chinese Quarter frequently. There I used to watch agreat hulking Chinese workman at his task of digging, and used tosee him every day drink his tea from a little cup as delicate intexture as the petal of a flower, whereas in all the grand hotelsof the land, where thousands of dollars have been lavished on greatgilt mirrors and gaudy columns, I have been given my coffee or mychocolate in cups an inch and a quarter thick. I think I havedeserved something nicer.
The art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers wholooked upon human beings as obstructions. They have tried toeducate boys' minds before they had any. How much better it wouldbe in these early years to teach children to use their hands in therational service of mankind. I would have a workshop attached toevery school, and one hour a day given up to the teaching of simpledecorative arts. It would be a golden hour to the children. Andyou would soon raise up a race of handicraftsmen who wouldtransform the face of your country. I have seen only one suchschool in the United States, and this was in Philadelphia and wasfounded by my friend Mr. Leyland. I stopped there yesterday andhave brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you.Here are two disks of beaten brass: the designs on them arebeautiful, the workmanship is simple, and the entire result issatisfactory. The work was done by a little boy twelve years old.This is a wooden bowl decorated by a little girl of thirteen. Thedesign is lovely and the colouring delicate and pretty. Here yousee a piece of beautiful wood carving accomplished by a little boyof nine. In such work as this, children learn sincerity in art.They learn to abhor the liar in art - the man who paints wood tolook like iron, or iron to look like stone. It is a practicalschool of morals. No better way is there to learn to love Naturethan to understand Art. It dignifies every flower of the field.And, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wingbecomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throwthe customary stone. What we want is something spiritual added tolife. Nothing is so ignoble that Art cannot sanctify it.
