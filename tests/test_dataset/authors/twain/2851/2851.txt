Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I wouldwrite an autobiography they would read it, when they got leisure, I yieldat last to this frenzied public demand, and herewith tender my history:
Ours is a noble old house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity.The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of thefamily by the name of Higgins.  This was in the eleventh century, whenour people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England.  Why it isthat our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except whenone of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avertfoolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has everfelt much desire to stir.  It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and weleave it alone.  All the old families do that way.
Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note a solicitor on the highwayin William Rufus' time.  At about the age of thirty he went to one ofthose fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see aboutsomething, and never returned again.  While there he died suddenly.
Augustus Twain, seems to have made something of a stir about the year1160.  He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his oldsabre and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night,and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump.  He was aborn humorist.  But he got to going too far with it; and the first timehe was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed oneend of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where itcould contemplate the people and have a good time.  He never liked anysituation so much or stuck to it so long.
Then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession ofsoldiers--noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battlesinging; right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, rightahead of it.
This is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart's poor witticism that ourfamily tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck out atright angles, and bore fruit winter, and summer.

Early in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called "the Scholar."He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand.  And he could imitate anybody'shand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off tosee it.  He had infinite sport with his talent.  But by and by he took acontract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiledhis hand.  Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stonebusiness, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years.In fact, he died in harness.  During all those long years he gave suchsatisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week tillgovernment gave him another.  He was a perfect pet.  And he was always afavorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of theirbenevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang.  He always wore hishair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented bythe government.  He was a sore loss to his country.  For he was soregular.
Some years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain.  He came overto this country with Columbus in 1492, as a passenger.  He appears tohave been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition.  He complained of thefood all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unlessthere was a change.  He wanted fresh shad.  Hardly a day passed over hishead that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air,sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knewwhere he was going to or had ever been there before.  The memorable cryof "Land ho!" thrilled every heart in the ship but his.  He gazed a whilethrough a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distantwater, and then said: "Land be hanged,--it's a raft!"
When this questionable passenger came on board the ship, he broughtnothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked"B. G.," one cotton sock marked "L. W. C." one woollen one marked "D. F."and a night-shirt marked "O. M. R."  And yet during the voyage he worriedmore about his "trunk," and gave himself more airs about it, than allthe rest of the passengers put together.
If the ship was "down by the head," and would got steer, he would go andmove his "trunk" farther aft, and then watch the effect.  If theship was "by the stern," he would suggest to Columbus to detail some mento "shift that baggage."  In storms he had to be gagged, because hiswailings about his "trunk" made it impossible for the men to hear theorders.  The man does not appear to have been openly charged with anygravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship's log as a "curiouscircumstance" that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in anewspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and acouple of champagne baskets.  But when he came back insinuating in aninsolent, swaggering way, that some of his things were missing, and wasgoing to search the other passengers' baggage, it was too much, and theythrew him overboard.  They watched long and wonderingly for him to comeup, but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide.  But whileevery one was most absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest wasmomentarily increasing, it was observed with consternation that thevessel was adrift and the anchor cable hanging limp from the bow.  Thenin the ship's dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:
          "In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde          gonne downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to          ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it,          ye sonne of a ghun!"
Yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride thatwe call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who everinterested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians.He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his dying day heclaimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining andelevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever,labored among them.  At this point the chronicle becomes less frank andchatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to seehis gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America, andwhile there received injuries which terminated in his death.
The great grandson of the "Reformer" flourished in sixteen hundred andsomething, and was known in our annals as, "the old Admiral," though inhistory he had other titles.  He was long in command of fleets of swiftvessels, well armed and, manned, and did great service in hurrying upmerchantmen.  Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, alwaysmade good fair time across the ocean.  But if a ship still loitered inspite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he couldcontain himself no longer--and then he would take that ship home where helived and, keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for it,but they never did.  And he would try to get the idleness and sloth outof the sailors of that ship by compelling, them to take invigoratingexercise and a bath.  He called it "walking a plank."  All the pupilsliked it.  At any rate, they never found any fault with it after tryingit.  When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral alwaysburned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost.  At lastthis fine old tar was cut down in the fulness of his years and honors.And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he hadbeen cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated.
Charles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenthcentury, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary.  He convertedsixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-toothnecklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come todivine service in.  His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and whenhis funeral was over, they got up in a body (and came out of therestaurant) with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that hewas a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of him.
PAH-GO-TO-WAH-WAH-PUKKETEKEEWIS (Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye) TWAINadorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided Gen. Braddockwith all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington.  It was thisancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree.So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books iscorrect; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenthround the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was beingreserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared notlift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriouslyimpairs the integrity of history.  What he did say was:
"It ain't no (hic !) no use.  'At man's so drunk he can't stan' stilllong enough for a man to hit him.  I (hic !) I can't 'ford to fool awayany more am'nition on him!"
That was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was, a goodplain matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself tous by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it.
I always enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgivingthat every Indian at Braddock's Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple oftimes (two easily grows to seventeen in a century), and missed him,jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldierfor some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only reason whyWashington's case is remembered and the others forgotten is, that in histhe prophecy' came true, and in that of the others it didn't.  There arenot books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indiansand other unauthorized parties have made; but one may carry in hisovercoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have beenfulfilled.
I will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are sothoroughly well known in history by their aliases, that I have not feltit to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in theorder of their birth.  Among these may be mentioned RICHARD BRINSLEYTWAIN, alias Guy Fawkes; JOHN WENTWORTH TWAIN, alias Sixteen-String Jack;WILLIAM HOGARTH TWAIN, alias Jack Sheppard; ANANIAS TWAIN, alias BaronMunchausen; JOHN GEORGE TWAIN, alias Capt. Kydd; and them there areGeorge Francis Train, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar and Baalam's Ass--theyall belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat distantlyremoved from the honorable direct line--in fact, a collateral branch,whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in order toacquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for, they havegot into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged.
It is not well; when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestrydown too close to your own time--it is safest to speak only vaguely ofyour great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I nowdo.
I was born without teeth--and there Richard III had the advantage of me;but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had theadvantage of him.  My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuouslyhonest.
But now a thought occurs to me.  My own history would really seem so tamecontrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leaveit unwritten until I am hanged.  If some other biographies I have readhad stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would havebeen a felicitous thing, for the reading public.  How does it strike you?



                            AWFUL, TERRIBLE                            MEDIEVAL ROMANCE
CHAPTER I
THE SECRET REVEALED.
It was night.  Stillness reigned in the grand old feudal castle ofKlugenstein.  The year 1222 was drawing to a close.  Far away up in thetallest of the castle's towers a single light glimmered.  A secretcouncil was being held there.  The stern old lord of Klugenstein sat ina chair of state meditating.  Presently he, said, with a tenderaccent:
"My daughter!"
A young man of noble presence, clad from head to heel in knightly mail,answered:
"Speak, father!"
"My daughter, the time is come for the revealing of the mystery that hathpuzzled all your young life.  Know, then, that it had its birth in thematters which I shall now unfold.  My brother Ulrich is the great Duke ofBrandenburgh.  Our father, on his deathbed, decreed that if no son wereborn to Ulrich, the succession should pass to my house, provided a sonwere born to me.  And further, in case no son, were born to either, butonly daughters, then the succession should pass to Ulrich's daughter,if she proved stainless; if she did not, my daughter should succeed,if she retained a blameless name.  And so I, and my old wife here, prayedfervently for the good boon of a son, but the prayer was vain.  You wereborn to us.  I was in despair.  I saw the mighty prize slipping from mygrasp, the splendid dream vanishing away.  And I had been so hopeful!Five years had Ulrich lived in wedlock, and yet his wife had borne noheir of either sex.
"'But hold,' I said, 'all is not lost.'  A saving scheme had shot athwartmy brain.  You were born at midnight.  Only the leech, the nurse, and sixwaiting-women knew your sex.  I hanged them every one before an hour hadsped.  Next morning all the barony went mad with rejoicing over theproclamation that a son was born to Klugenstein, an heir to mightyBrandenburgh!  And well the secret has been kept.  Your mother's ownsister nursed your infancy, and from that time forward we feared nothing.
"When you were ten years old, a daughter was born to Ulrich.  We grieved,but hoped for good results from measles, or physicians, or other naturalenemies of infancy, but were always disappointed.  She lived, she throve--Heaven's malison upon her!  But it is nothing.  We are safe.  For,Ha-ha! have we not a son?  And is not our son the future Duke?  Ourwell-beloved Conrad, is it not so?--for, woman of eight-and-twenty years--as you are, my child, none other name than that hath ever fallen to you!
"Now it hath come to pass that age hath laid its hand upon my brother,and he waxes feeble.  The cares of state do tax him sore.  Therefore hewills that you shall come to him and be already Duke--in act, though notyet in name.  Your servitors are ready--you journey forth to-night.
"Now listen well.  Remember every word I say.  There is a law as old asGermany that if any woman sit for a single instant in the great ducalchair before she hath been absolutely crowned in presence of the people,SHE SHALL DIE! So heed my words.  Pretend humility.  Pronounce yourjudgments from the Premier's chair, which stands at the foot of thethrone.  Do this until you are crowned and safe.  It is not likely thatyour sex will ever be discovered; but still it is the part of wisdom tomake all things as safe as may be in this treacherous earthly life."
"Oh; my father, is it for this my life hath been a lie!  Was it that Imight cheat my unoffending cousin of her rights?  Spare me, father,spare your child!"
"What, huzzy!  Is this my reward for the august fortune my brain haswrought for thee?  By the bones of my father, this puling sentiment ofthine but ill accords with my humor.
"Betake thee to the Duke, instantly!  And beware how thou meddlest with mypurpose!"
Let this suffice, of the conversation.  It is enough for us to know thatthe prayers, the entreaties and the tears of the gentle-natured girlavailed nothing.  They nor anything could move the stout old lord ofKlugenstein.  And so, at last, with a heavy heart, the daughter saw thecastle gates close behind her, and found herself riding away in thedarkness surrounded by a knightly array of armed, vassals and a bravefollowing of servants.
The old baron sat silent for many minutes after his daughter's departure,and then he turned to his sad wife and said:
"Dame, our matters seem speeding fairly.  It is full three months since Isent the shrewd and handsome Count Detzin on his devilish mission to mybrother's daughter Constance.  If he fail, we are not wholly safe; but ifhe do succeed, no power can bar our girl from being Duchess e'en thoughill-fortune should decree she never should be Duke!"
"My heart is full of bodings, yet all may still be well."
"Tush, woman! Leave the owls to croak.  To bed with ye, and dream ofBrandenburgh and grandeur!"

CHAPTER II.
FESTIVITY AND TEARS
Six days after the occurrences related in the above chapter, thebrilliant capital of the Duchy of Brandenburgh was resplendent withmilitary pageantry, and noisy with the rejoicings of loyal multitudes;for Conrad, the young heir to the crown, was come.  The old Duke's, heartwas full of happiness, for Conrad's handsome person and graceful bearinghad won his love at once.  The great halls of the palace were throngedwith nobles, who welcomed Conrad bravely; and so bright and happy did allthings seem, that he felt his fears and sorrows passing away and givingplace to a comforting contentment.
But in a remote apartment of the palace a scene of a different naturewas, transpiring.  By a window stood the Duke's only child, the LadyConstance.  Her eyes were red and swollen, and full of tears.  She wasalone.  Presently she fell to weeping anew, and said aloud:
"The villain Detzin is gone--has fled the dukedom!  I could not believeit at first, but alas! it is too true.  And I loved him so.  I dared tolove him though I knew the Duke my father would never let me wed him.I loved him--but now I hate him!  With all, my soul I hate him!  Oh, whatis to become of me!  I am lost, lost, lost!  I shall go mad!"

CHAPTER III.
THE PLOT THICKENS.
Few months drifted by.  All men published the praises of the youngConrad's government and extolled the wisdom of his judgments, themercifulness of his sentences, and the modesty with which he bore himselfin his great office.  The old Duke soon gave everything into his hands,and sat apart and listened with proud satisfaction while his heirdelivered the decrees of the crown from the seat of the premier.It seemed plain that one so loved and praised and honored of all menas Conrad was, could not be otherwise than happy.  But strange enough,he was not.  For he saw with dismay that the Princess Constance had begunto love him!  The love of, the rest of the world was happy fortune forhim, but this was freighted with danger!  And he saw, moreover, that thedelighted Duke had discovered his daughter's passion likewise, and wasalready dreaming of a marriage.  Every day somewhat of the deep sadnessthat had been in the princess' face faded away; every day hope andanimation beamed brighter from her eye; and by and by even vagrant smilesvisited the face that had been so troubled.
Conrad was appalled.  He bitterly cursed himself for having yielded tothe instinct that had made him seek the companionship of one of his ownsex when he was new and a stranger in the palace--when he was sorrowfuland yearned for a sympathy such as only women can give or feel.  He nowbegan to avoid, his cousin.  But this only made matters worse, for,naturally enough, the more he avoided her, the more she cast herself inhis way.  He marveled at this at first; and next it startled him.  Thegirl haunted him; she hunted him; she happened upon him at all times andin all places, in the night as well as in the day.  She seemed singularlyanxious.  There was surely a mystery somewhere.
This could not go on forever.  All the world was talking about it.  TheDuke was beginning to look perplexed.  Poor Conrad was becoming a veryghost through dread and dire distress.  One day as he was emerging from aprivate ante-room attached to the picture gallery, Constance confrontedhim, and seizing both his hands, in hers, exclaimed:
"Oh, why, do you avoid me?  What have I done--what have I said, to loseyour kind opinion of me--for, surely I had it once?  Conrad, do notdespise me, but pity a tortured heart?  I cannot--cannot hold the wordsunspoken longer, lest they kill me--I LOVE you, CONRAD!  There, despiseme if you must, but they would be uttered!"
Conrad was speechless.  Constance hesitated a moment, and then,misinterpreting his silence, a wild gladness flamed in her eyes, and sheflung her arms about his neck and said:
"You relent! you relent! You can love me--you will love me! Oh, say youwill, my own, my worshipped Conrad!'"
Conrad groaned aloud.  A sickly pallor overspread his countenance, andhe trembled like an aspen.  Presently, in desperation, he thrust the poorgirl from him, and cried:
"You know not what you ask!  It is forever and ever impossible!"  And thenhe fled like a criminal and left the princess stupefied with amazement.A minute afterward she was crying and sobbing there, and Conrad wascrying and sobbing in his chamber.  Both were in despair.  Both save ruinstaring them in the face.
By and by Constance rose slowly to her feet and moved away, saying:
"To think that he was despising my love at the very moment that I thoughtit was melting his cruel heart!  I hate him!  He spurned me--did thisman--he spurned me from him like a dog!"

CHAPTER IV
THE AWFUL REVELATION.
Time passed on.  A settled sadness rested once more upon the countenanceof the good Duke's daughter.  She and Conrad were seen together no morenow.  The Duke grieved at this.  But as the weeks wore away, Conrad'scolor came back to his cheeks and his old-time vivacity to his eye, andhe administered the government with a clear and steadily ripening wisdom.
Presently a strange whisper began to be heard about the palace.  It grewlouder; it spread farther.  The gossips of the city got hold-of it.  Itswept the dukedom.  And this is what the whisper said:
"The Lady Constance hath given birth to a child!"
When the lord of Klugenstein heard it, he swung his plumed helmet thricearound his head and shouted:
"Long live.  Duke Conrad!--for lo, his crown is sure, from this dayforward!  Detzin has done his errand well, and the good scoundrel shallbe rewarded!"
And he spread, the tidings far and wide, and for eight-and-forty hours nosoul in all the barony but did dance and sing, carouse and illuminate, tocelebrate the great event, and all at proud and happy old Klugenstein'sexpense.

CHAPTER V.
THE FRIGHTFUL CATASTROPHE.
The trial was at hand.  All the great lords and barons of Brandenburghwere assembled in the Hall of Justice in the ducal palace.  No space wasleft unoccupied where there was room for a spectator to stand or sit.Conrad, clad in purple and ermine, sat in the premier's chair, and oneither side sat the great judges of the realm.  The old Duke had sternlycommanded that the trial of his daughter should proceed, without favor,and then had taken to his bed broken-hearted.  His days were numbered.Poor Conrad had begged, as for his very life, that he might be spared themisery of sitting in judgment upon his cousin's crime, but it did notavail.
The saddest heart in all that great assemblage was in Conrad's breast.
The gladdest was in his father's.  For, unknown to his daughter "Conrad,"the old Baron Klugenstein was come, and was among the crowd of nobles,triumphant in the swelling fortunes of his house.
After the heralds had made due proclamation and the other preliminarieshad followed, the venerable Lord Chief justice said:
"Prisoner, stand forth!"
The unhappy princess rose and stood unveiled before the vast multitude.The Lord Chief Justice continued:
"Most noble lady, before the great judges of this realm it hath beencharged and proven that out of holy wedlock your Grace hath given birthunto a child; and by our ancient law the penalty is death, excepting inone sole contingency, whereof his Grace the acting Duke, our good LordConrad, will advertise you in his solemn sentence now; wherefore, giveheed."
Conrad stretched forth the reluctant sceptre, and in the self-same momentthe womanly heart beneath his robe yearned pityingly toward the doomedprisoner, and the tears came into his eyes.  He opened his lips to speak,but the Lord Chief Justice said quickly:
"Not there, your Grace, not there!  It is not lawful to pronouncejudgment upon any of the ducal line SAVE FROM THE DUCAL THRONE!"
A shudder went to the heart of poor Conrad, and a tremor shook the ironframe of his old father likewise.  CONRAD HAD NOT BEEN CROWNED--dared heprofane the throne? He hesitated and turned pale with fear.  But it mustbe done.  Wondering eyes were already upon him.  They would be suspiciouseyes if he hesitated longer.  He ascended the throne.  Presently hestretched forth the sceptre again, and said:
"Prisoner, in the name of our sovereign lord, Ulrich, Duke ofBrandenburgh, I proceed to the solemn duty that hath devolved upon me.Give heed to my words.  By the ancient law of the land, except youproduce the partner of your guilt and deliver him up to the executioner,you must surely die.  Embrace this opportunity--save yourself while yetyou may.  Name the father of your child!"
A solemn hush fell upon the great court--a silence so profound that mencould hear their own hearts beat.  Then the princess slowly turned, witheyes gleaming with hate, and pointing her finger straight at Conrad,said:
"Thou art the man!"
An appalling conviction of his helpless, hopeless peril struck a chill toConrad's heart like the chill of death itself.  What power on earth couldsave him!  To disprove the charge, he must reveal that he was a woman;and for an uncrowned woman to sit in the ducal chair was death!  At oneand the same moment, he and his grim old father swooned and fell to, theground.
[The remainder of this thrilling and eventful story will NOT be found inthis or any other publication, either now or at any future time.]
The truth is, I have got my hero (or heroine) into such a particularlyclose place, that I do not see how I am ever going to get him (or her)out of it again--and therefore I will wash my hands of the wholebusiness, and leave that person to get out the best way that offers--orelse stay there.  I thought it was going to be easy enough to straightenout that little difficulty, but it looks different now.
