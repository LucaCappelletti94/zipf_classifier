The next day was an outrage upon men and horses both.  It was anotherthirteen-hour stretch (including an hour's "nooning.") It was over thebarrenest chalk-hills and through the baldest canons that even Syria canshow.  The heat quivered in the air every where.  In the canons we almostsmothered in the baking atmosphere.  On high ground, the reflection fromthe chalk-hills was blinding.  It was cruel to urge the crippled horses,but it had to be done in order to make Damascus Saturday night.  We sawancient tombs and temples of fanciful architecture carved out of thesolid rock high up in the face of precipices above our heads, but we hadneither time nor strength to climb up there and examine them.  The terselanguage of my note-book will answer for the rest of this day'sexperiences:
     "Broke camp at 7 A.M., and made a ghastly trip through the Zeb Dana     valley and the rough mountains--horses limping and that Arab     screech-owl that does most of the singing and carries the     water-skins, always a thousand miles ahead, of course, and no water     to drink--will he never die?  Beautiful stream in a chasm, lined     thick with pomegranate, fig, olive and quince orchards, and nooned     an hour at the celebrated Baalam's Ass Fountain of Figia, second in     size in Syria, and the coldest water out of Siberia--guide-books do     not say Baalam's ass ever drank there--somebody been imposing on     the pilgrims, may be.  Bathed in it--Jack and I.  Only a     second--ice-water.  It is the principal source of the Abana river     --only one-half mile down to where it joins.  Beautiful     place--giant trees all around--so shady and cool, if one could keep     awake--vast stream gushes straight out from under the mountain in a     torrent.  Over it is a very ancient ruin, with no known history     --supposed to have been for the worship of the deity of the fountain     or Baalam's ass or somebody.  Wretched nest of human vermin about     the fountain--rags, dirt, sunken cheeks, pallor of sickness, sores,     projecting bones, dull, aching misery in their eyes and ravenous     hunger speaking from every eloquent fibre and muscle from head to     foot. How they sprang upon a bone, how they crunched the bread we     gave them!  Such as these to swarm about one and watch every bite     he takes, with greedy looks, and swallow unconsciously every time     he swallows, as if they half fancied the precious morsel went down     their own throats--hurry up the caravan!--I never shall enjoy a     meal in this distressful country.  To think of eating three times     every day under such circumstances for three weeks yet--it is worse     punishment than riding all day in the sun.  There are sixteen     starving babies from one to six years old in the party, and their     legs are no larger than broom handles.  Left the fountain at 1 P.M.     (the fountain took us at least two hours out of our way,) and     reached Mahomet's lookout perch, over Damascus, in time to get a     good long look before it was necessary to move on.  Tired?  Ask of     the winds that far away with fragments strewed the sea."
As the glare of day mellowed into twilight, we looked down upon a picturewhich is celebrated all over the world.  I think I have read about fourhundred times that when Mahomet was a simple camel-driver he reached thispoint and looked down upon Damascus for the first time, and then made acertain renowned remark.  He said man could enter only one paradise; hepreferred to go to the one above.  So he sat down there and feasted hiseyes upon the earthly paradise of Damascus, and then went away withoutentering its gates.  They have erected a tower on the hill to mark thespot where he stood.
Damascus is beautiful from the mountain.  It is beautiful even toforeigners accustomed to luxuriant vegetation, and I can easilyunderstand how unspeakably beautiful it must be to eyes that are onlyused to the God-forsaken barrenness and desolation of Syria.  I shouldthink a Syrian would go wild with ecstacy when such a picture bursts uponhim for the first time.
From his high perch, one sees before him and below him, a wall of drearymountains, shorn of vegetation, glaring fiercely in the sun; it fences ina level desert of yellow sand, smooth as velvet and threaded far awaywith fine lines that stand for roads, and dotted with creeping mites weknow are camel-trains and journeying men; right in the midst of thedesert is spread a billowy expanse of green foliage; and nestling in itsheart sits the great white city, like an island of pearls and opalsgleaming out of a sea of emeralds.  This is the picture you see spreadfar below you, with distance to soften it, the sun to glorify it, strongcontrasts to heighten the effects, and over it and about it a drowsingair of repose to spiritualize it and make it seem rather a beautifulestray from the mysterious worlds we visit in dreams than a substantialtenant of our coarse, dull globe.  And when you think of the leagues ofblighted, blasted, sandy, rocky, sun-burnt, ugly, dreary, infamouscountry you have ridden over to get here, you think it is the mostbeautiful, beautiful picture that ever human eyes rested upon in all thebroad universe!  If I were to go to Damascus again, I would camp onMahomet's hill about a week, and then go away.  There is no need to goinside the walls.  The Prophet was wise without knowing it when hedecided not to go down into the paradise of Damascus.
There is an honored old tradition that the immense garden which Damascusstands in was the Garden of Eden, and modern writers have gathered upmany chapters of evidence tending to show that it really was the Gardenof Eden, and that the rivers Pharpar and Abana are the "two rivers" thatwatered Adam's Paradise.  It may be so, but it is not paradise now, andone would be as happy outside of it as he would be likely to be within.It is so crooked and cramped and dirty that one can not realize that heis in the splendid city he saw from the hill-top.  The gardens are hiddenby high mud-walls, and the paradise is become a very sink of pollutionand uncomeliness.  Damascus has plenty of clear, pure water in it,though, and this is enough, of itself, to make an Arab think it beautifuland blessed.  Water is scarce in blistered Syria.  We run railways by ourlarge cities in America; in Syria they curve the roads so as to make themrun by the meagre little puddles they call "fountains," and which are notfound oftener on a journey than every four hours.  But the "rivers" ofPharpar and Abana of Scripture (mere creeks,) run through Damascus, andso every house and every garden have their sparkling fountains andrivulets of water.  With her forest of foliage and her abundance ofwater, Damascus must be a wonder of wonders to the Bedouin from thedeserts.  Damascus is simply an oasis--that is what it is.  For fourthousand years its waters have not gone dry or its fertility failed.Now we can understand why the city has existed so long.  It could notdie.  So long as its waters remain to it away out there in the midst ofthat howling desert, so long will Damascus live to bless the sight of thetired and thirsty wayfarer.
     "Though old as history itself, thou art fresh as the breath of     spring, blooming as thine own rose-bud, and fragrant as thine own     orange flower, O Damascus, pearl of the East!"
Damascus dates back anterior to the days of Abraham, and is the oldestcity in the world.  It was founded by Uz, the grandson of Noah.  "Theearly history of Damascus is shrouded in the mists of a hoary antiquity."Leave the matters written of in the first eleven chapters of the OldTestament out, and no recorded event has occurred in the world butDamascus was in existence to receive the news of it.  Go back as far asyou will into the vague past, there was always a Damascus.  In thewritings of every century for more than four thousand years, its name hasbeen mentioned and its praises sung.  To Damascus, years are onlymoments, decades are only flitting trifles of time.  She measures time,not by days and months and years, but by the empires she has seen rise,and prosper and crumble to ruin.  She is a type of immortality.  She sawthe foundations of Baalbec, and Thebes, and Ephesus laid; she saw thesevillages grow into mighty cities, and amaze the world with theirgrandeur--and she has lived to see them desolate, deserted, and givenover to the owls and the bats.  She saw the Israelitish empire exalted,and she saw it annihilated.  She saw Greece rise, and flourish twothousand years, and die.  In her old age she saw Rome built; she saw itovershadow the world with its power; she saw it perish.  The few hundredsof years of Genoese and Venetian might and splendor were, to grave oldDamascus, only a trifling scintillation hardly worth remembering.Damascus has seen all that has ever occurred on earth, and still shelives.  She has looked upon the dry bones of a thousand empires, and willsee the tombs of a thousand more before she dies.  Though another claimsthe name, old Damascus is by right the Eternal City.
We reached the city gates just at sundown.  They do say that one can getinto any walled city of Syria, after night, for bucksheesh, exceptDamascus.  But Damascus, with its four thousand years of respectabilityin the world, has many old fogy notions.  There are no street lampsthere, and the law compels all who go abroad at night to carry lanterns,just as was the case in old days, when heroes and heroines of the ArabianNights walked the streets of Damascus, or flew away toward Bagdad onenchanted carpets.
It was fairly dark a few minutes after we got within the wall, and werode long distances through wonderfully crooked streets, eight to tenfeet wide, and shut in on either side by the high mud-walls of thegardens.  At last we got to where lanterns could be seen flitting abouthere and there, and knew we were in the midst of the curious old city.In a little narrow street, crowded with our pack-mules and with a swarmof uncouth Arabs, we alighted, and through a kind of a hole in the wallentered the hotel.  We stood in a great flagged court, with flowers andcitron trees about us, and a huge tank in the centre that was receivingthe waters of many pipes.  We crossed the court and entered the roomsprepared to receive four of us.  In a large marble-paved recess betweenthe two rooms was a tank of clear, cool water, which was kept runningover all the time by the streams that were pouring into it from half adozen pipes.  Nothing, in this scorching, desolate land could look sorefreshing as this pure water flashing in the lamp-light; nothing couldlook so beautiful, nothing could sound so delicious as this mimic rain toears long unaccustomed to sounds of such a nature.  Our rooms were large,comfortably furnished, and even had their floors clothed with soft,cheerful-tinted carpets.  It was a pleasant thing to see a carpet again,for if there is any thing drearier than the tomb-like, stone-pavedparlors and bed-rooms of Europe and Asia, I do not know what it is.They make one think of the grave all the time.  A very broad, gailycaparisoned divan, some twelve or fourteen feet long, extended across oneside of each room, and opposite were single beds with spring mattresses.There were great looking-glasses and marble-top tables.  All this luxurywas as grateful to systems and senses worn out with an exhausting day'stravel, as it was unexpected--for one can not tell what to expect in aTurkish city of even a quarter of a million inhabitants.
I do not know, but I think they used that tank between the rooms to drawdrinking water from; that did not occur to me, however, until I haddipped my baking head far down into its cool depths.  I thought of itthen, and superb as the bath was, I was sorry I had taken it, and wasabout to go and explain to the landlord.  But a finely curled and scentedpoodle dog frisked up and nipped the calf of my leg just then, and beforeI had time to think, I had soused him to the bottom of the tank, and whenI saw a servant coming with a pitcher I went off and left the pup tryingto climb out and not succeeding very well.  Satisfied revenge was all Ineeded to make me perfectly happy, and when I walked in to supper thatfirst night in Damascus I was in that condition.  We lay on those divansa long time, after supper, smoking narghilies and long-stemmed chibouks,and talking about the dreadful ride of the day, and I knew then what Ihad sometimes known before--that it is worth while to get tired out,because one so enjoys resting afterward.
In the morning we sent for donkeys.  It is worthy of note that we had tosend for these things.  I said Damascus was an old fossil, and she is.Any where else we would have been assailed by a clamorous army ofdonkey-drivers, guides, peddlers and beggars--but in Damascus they sohate the very sight of a foreign Christian that they want no intercoursewhatever with him; only a year or two ago, his person was not alwayssafe in Damascus streets.  It is the most fanatical Mohammedan purgatoryout of Arabia.  Where you see one green turban of a Hadji elsewhere (thehonored sign that my lord has made the pilgrimage to Mecca,) I think youwill see a dozen in Damascus.  The Damascenes are the ugliest, wickedestlooking villains we have seen.  All the veiled women we had seen yet,nearly, left their eyes exposed, but numbers of these in Damascuscompletely hid the face under a close-drawn black veil that made thewoman look like a mummy.  If ever we caught an eye exposed it wasquickly hidden from our contaminating Christian vision; the beggarsactually passed us by without demanding bucksheesh; the merchants in thebazaars did not hold up their goods and cry out eagerly, "Hey, John!"or "Look this, Howajji!"  On the contrary, they only scowled at us andsaid never a word.
The narrow streets swarmed like a hive with men and women in strangeOriental costumes, and our small donkeys knocked them right and left aswe plowed through them, urged on by the merciless donkey-boys.  Thesepersecutors run after the animals, shouting and goading them for hourstogether; they keep the donkey in a gallop always, yet never get tiredthemselves or fall behind.  The donkeys fell down and spilt us over theirheads occasionally, but there was nothing for it but to mount and hurryon again.  We were banged against sharp corners, loaded porters, camels,and citizens generally; and we were so taken up with looking out forcollisions and casualties that we had no chance to look about us at all.We rode half through the city and through the famous "street which iscalled Straight" without seeing any thing, hardly.  Our bones were nearlyknocked out of joint, we were wild with excitement, and our sides achedwith the jolting we had suffered.  I do not like riding in the Damascusstreet-cars.
We were on our way to the reputed houses of Judas and Ananias.  Abouteighteen or nineteen hundred years ago, Saul, a native of Tarsus, wasparticularly bitter against the new sect called Christians, and he leftJerusalem and started across the country on a furious crusade againstthem.  He went forth "breathing threatenings and slaughter against thedisciples of the Lord."
     "And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus, and suddenly there     shined round about him a light from heaven:
     "And he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him, 'Saul,     Saul, why persecutest thou me?'
     "And when he knew that it was Jesus that spoke to him he trembled,     and was astonished, and said, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?'"
He was told to arise and go into the ancient city and one would tellhim what to do.  In the meantime his soldiers stood speechless andawe-stricken, for they heard the mysterious voice but saw no man.  Saulrose up and found that that fierce supernatural light had destroyed hissight, and he was blind, so "they led him by the hand and brought him toDamascus."  He was converted.
Paul lay three days, blind, in the house of Judas, and during that timehe neither ate nor drank.
There came a voice to a citizen of Damascus, named Ananias, saying,"Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire atthe house of Judas, for one called Saul, of Tarsus; for behold, heprayeth."
Ananias did not wish to go at first, for he had heard of Saul before, andhe had his doubts about that style of a "chosen vessel" to preach thegospel of peace.  However, in obedience to orders, he went into the"street called Straight" (how he found his way into it, and after he did,how he ever found his way out of it again, are mysteries only to beaccounted for by the fact that he was acting under Divine inspiration.)He found Paul and restored him, and ordained him a preacher; and fromthis old house we had hunted up in the street which is miscalledStraight, he had started out on that bold missionary career which heprosecuted till his death.  It was not the house of the disciple who soldthe Master for thirty pieces of silver.  I make this explanation injustice to Judas, who was a far different sort of man from the personjust referred to.  A very different style of man, and lived in a verygood house.  It is a pity we do not know more about him.
I have given, in the above paragraphs, some more information for peoplewho will not read Bible history until they are defrauded into it by somesuch method as this.  I hope that no friend of progress and educationwill obstruct or interfere with my peculiar mission.
The street called Straight is straighter than a corkscrew, but not asstraight as a rainbow.  St. Luke is careful not to commit himself; hedoes not say it is the street which is straight, but the "street which iscalled Straight."  It is a fine piece of irony; it is the only facetiousremark in the Bible, I believe.  We traversed the street called Straighta good way, and then turned off and called at the reputed house ofAnanias.  There is small question that a part of the original house isthere still; it is an old room twelve or fifteen feet under ground, andits masonry is evidently ancient.  If Ananias did not live there in St.Paul's time, somebody else did, which is just as well.  I took a drinkout of Ananias' well, and singularly enough, the water was just as freshas if the well had been dug yesterday.
We went out toward the north end of the city to see the place where thedisciples let Paul down over the Damascus wall at dead of night--for hepreached Christ so fearlessly in Damascus that the people sought to killhim, just as they would to-day for the same offense, and he had to escapeand flee to Jerusalem.
Then we called at the tomb of Mahomet's children and at a tomb whichpurported to be that of St. George who killed the dragon, and so on outto the hollow place under a rock where Paul hid during his flight tillhis pursuers gave him up; and to the mausoleum of the five thousandChristians who were massacred in Damascus in 1861 by the Turks.  They saythose narrow streets ran blood for several days, and that men, women andchildren were butchered indiscriminately and left to rot by hundreds allthrough the Christian quarter; they say, further, that the stench wasdreadful.  All the Christians who could get away fled from the city, andthe Mohammedans would not defile their hands by burying the "infideldogs."  The thirst for blood extended to the high lands of Hermon andAnti-Lebanon, and in a short time twenty-five thousand more Christianswere massacred and their possessions laid waste.  How they hate aChristian in Damascus!--and pretty much all over Turkeydom as well.  Andhow they will pay for it when Russia turns her guns upon them again!
It is soothing to the heart to abuse England and France for interposingto save the Ottoman Empire from the destruction it has so richly deservedfor a thousand years.  It hurts my vanity to see these pagans refuse toeat of food that has been cooked for us; or to eat from a dish we haveeaten from; or to drink from a goatskin which we have polluted with ourChristian lips, except by filtering the water through a rag which theyput over the mouth of it or through a sponge!  I never disliked aChinaman as I do these degraded Turks and Arabs, and when Russia is readyto war with them again, I hope England and France will not find it goodbreeding or good judgment to interfere.
In Damascus they think there are no such rivers in all the world as theirlittle Abana and Pharpar.  The Damascenes have always thought that way.In 2 Kings, chapter v., Naaman boasts extravagantly about them.  That wasthree thousand years ago.  He says: "Are not Abana and Pharpar rivers ofDamascus, better than all the waters of Israel?  May I not wash in themand be clean?"  But some of my readers have forgotten who Naaman was,long ago.  Naaman was the commander of the Syrian armies.  He was thefavorite of the king and lived in great state.  "He was a mighty man ofvalor, but he was a leper."  Strangely enough, the house they point outto you now as his, has been turned into a leper hospital, and the inmatesexpose their horrid deformities and hold up their hands and beg forbucksheesh when a stranger enters.
One can not appreciate the horror of this disease until he looks upon itin all its ghastliness, in Naaman's ancient dwelling in Damascus.  Bonesall twisted out of shape, great knots protruding from face and body,joints decaying and dropping away--horrible!
