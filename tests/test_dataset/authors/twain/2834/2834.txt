          ADDRESS AT THE FIRST ANNUAL DINNER, N. E.  SOCIETY,          PHILADELPHIA, DECEMBER 22, 1881
          On calling upon Mr. Clemens to make response,          President Rollins said:
          "This sentiment has been assigned to one who was never exactly          born in New England, nor, perhaps, were any of his ancestors.          He is not technically, therefore, of New England descent.          Under the painful circumstances in which he has found himself,          however, he has done the best he could--he has had all his          children born there, and has made of himself a New England          ancestor.  He is a self-made man.  More than this, and better          even, in cheerful, hopeful, helpful literature he is of New          England ascent.  To ascend there in any thing that's reasonable          is difficult; for--confidentially, with the door shut--we all          know that they are the brightest, ablest sons of that goodly          land who never leave it, and it is among and above them that          Mr. Twain has made his brilliant and permanent ascent--become          a man of mark."

I rise to protest. I have kept still for years; but really I think thereis no sufficient justification for this sort of thing. What do you wantto celebrate those people for?--those ancestors of yours of 1620--theMayflower tribe, I mean. What do you want to celebrate them for? Yourpardon: the gentleman at my left assures me that you are not celebratingthe Pilgrims themselves, but the landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth rockon the 22d of December. So you are celebrating their landing. Why, theother pretext was thin enough, but this is thinner than ever; the otherwas tissue, tinfoil, fish-bladder, but this is gold-leaf. Celebratingtheir lauding! What was there remarkable about it, I would like to know?What can you be thinking of? Why, those Pilgrims had been at sea threeor four months. It was the very middle of winter: it was as cold asdeath off Cape Cod there. Why shouldn't they come ashore? If theyhadn't landed there would be some reason for celebrating the fact: Itwould have been a case of monumental leatherheadedness which the worldwould not willingly let die. If it had been you, gentlemen, you probablywouldn't have landed, but you have no shadow of right to be celebrating,in your ancestors, gifts which they did not exercise, but onlytransmitted. Why, to be celebrating the mere landing of the Pilgrims--to be trying to make out that this most natural and simple andcustomary procedure was an extraordinary circumstance--a circumstance tobe amazed at, and admired, aggrandized and glorified, at orgies like thisfor two hundred and sixty years--hang it, a horse would have known enoughto land; a horse--Pardon again; the gentleman on my right assures me thatit was not merely the landing of the Pilgrims that we are celebrating,but the Pilgrims themselves. So we have struck an inconsistency here--one says it was the landing, the other says it was the Pilgrims. Itis an inconsistency characteristic of your intractable and disputatioustribe, for you never agree about anything but Boston. Well, then, whatdo you want to celebrate those Pilgrims for? They were a mighty hardlot--you know it. I grant you, without the slightest unwillingness, thatthey were a deal more gentle and merciful and just than were the peopleof Europe of that day; I grant you that they are better than theirpredecessors. But what of that?--that is nothing. People alwaysprogress. You are better than your fathers and grandfathers were(this is the first time I have ever aimed a measureless slander at thedeparted, for I consider such things improper). Yes, those among you whohave not been in the penitentiary, if such there be, are better than yourfathers and grandfathers were; but is that any sufficient reason, forgetting up annual dinners and celebrating you? No, by no means--by nomeans. Well, I repeat, those Pilgrims were a hard lot. They took goodcare of themselves, but they abolished everybody else's ancestors. I ama border-ruffian from the State of Missouri. I am a Connecticut Yankeeby adoption. In me, you have Missouri morals, Connecticut culture; this,gentlemen, is the combination which makes the perfect man. But where aremy ancestors? Whom shall I celebrate? Where shall I find the rawmaterial?
My first American ancestor, gentlemen, was an Indian--an early Indian.Your ancestors skinned him alive, and I am an orphan. Not one drop of myblood flows in that Indian's veins today. I stand here, lone andforlorn, without an ancestor. They skinned him! I do not object tothat, if they needed his fur; but alive, gentlemen-alive! They skinnedhim alive--and before company! That is what rankles. Think how he musthave felt; for he was a sensitive person and easily embarrassed. If hehad been a bird, it would have been all right, and no violence done tohis feelings, because he would have been considered "dressed." But hewas not a bird, gentlemen, he was a man, and probably one of the mostundressed men that ever was. I ask you to put yourselves in his place.I ask it as a favor; I ask it as a tardy act of justice; I ask it in theinterest of fidelity to the traditions of your ancestors; I ask it thatthe world may contemplate, with vision unobstructed by disguisingswallow-tails and white cravats, the spectacle which the true New EnglandSociety ought to present. Cease to come to these annual orgies in thishollow modern mockery--the surplusage of raiment. Come in character;come in the summer grace, come in the unadorned simplicity, come in thefree and joyous costume which your sainted ancestors provided for mine.
Later ancestors of mine were the Quakers William Robinson, MarmadukeStevenson, et al. Your tribe chased them put of the country for theirreligion's sake; promised them death if they came back; for yourancestors had forsaken the homes they loved, and braved the perils of thesea, the implacable climate, and the savage wilderness, to acquire thathighest and most precious of boons, freedom for every man on this broadcontinent to worship according to the dictates of his own conscience--andthey were not going to allow a lot of pestiferous Quakers to interferewith it. Your ancestors broke forever the chains of political slavery,and gave the vote to every man in this wide land, excluding none!--noneexcept those who did not belong to the orthodox church. Your ancestors--yes, they were a hard lot; but, nevertheless, they gave us religiousliberty to worship as they required us to worship, and political libertyto vote as the church required; and so I the bereft one, I the forlornone, am here to do my best to help you celebrate them right.
The Quaker woman Elizabeth Hooton was an ancestress of mine. Your peoplewere pretty severe with her you will confess that. But, poor thing!I believe they changed her opinions before she died, and took her intotheir fold; and so we have every reason to presume that when she died shewent to the same place which your ancestors went to. It is a great pity,for she was a good woman. Roger Williams was an ancestor of mine.I don't really remember what your people did with him. But they banishedhim to Rhode Island, anyway. And then, I believe, recognizing that thiswas really carrying harshness to an unjustifiable extreme, they took pityon him and burned him. They were a hard lot! All those Salem witcheswere ancestors of mine! Your people made it tropical for them. Yes,they did; by pressure and the gallows they made such a clean deal withthem that there hasn't been a witch and hardly a halter in our familyfrom that day to this, and that is one hundred and eighty-nine years.The first slave brought into New England out of Africa by yourprogenitors was an ancestor of mine--for I am of a mixed breed, aninfinitely shaded and exquisite Mongrel. I'm not one of your shammeerschaums that you can color in a week. No, my complexion is thepatient art of eight generations. Well, in my own time, I had acquired alot of my kin--by purchase, and swapping around, and one way and another--and was getting along very well. Then, with the inborn perversity ofyour lineage, you got up a war, and took them all away from me. And so,again am I bereft, again am I forlorn; no drop of my blood flows in theveins of any living being who is marketable.
O my friends, hear me and reform! I seek your good, not mine. You haveheard the speeches. Disband these New England societies--nurseries of asystem of steadily augmenting laudation and hosannaing, which; ifpersisted in uncurbed, may some day in the remote future beguile you intoprevaricating and bragging. Oh, stop, stop, while you are stilltemperate in your appreciation of your ancestors! Hear me, I beseechyou; get up an auction and sell Plymouth Rock! The Pilgrims were asimple and ignorant race. They never had seen any good rocks before, orat least any that were not watched, and so they were excusable forhopping ashore in frantic delight and clapping an iron fence around thisone. But you, gentlemen, are educated; you are enlightened; you knowthat in the rich land of your nativity, opulent New England, overflowingwith rocks, this one isn't worth, at the outside, more than thirty-fivecents. Therefore, sell it, before it is injured by exposure, or at leastthrow it open to the patent-medicine advertisements, and let it earn itstaxes:
Yes, hear your true friend-your only true friend--list to his voice.Disband these societies, hotbeds of vice, of moral decay--perpetuators ofancestral superstition. Here on this board I see water, I see milk, Isee the wild and deadly lemonade. These are but steps upon the downwardpath. Next we shall see tea, then chocolate, then coffee--hotel coffee.A few more years--all too few, I fear--mark my words, we shall havecider! Gentlemen, pause ere it be too late. You are on the broad roadwhich leads to dissipation, physical ruin, moral decay, gory crime andthe gallows! I beseech you, I implore you, in the name of your anxiousfriends, in the name of your suffering families, in the name of yourimpending widows and orphans, stop ere it be too late. Disband these NewEngland societies, renounce these soul-blistering saturnalia, cease fromvarnishing the rusty reputations of your long-vanished ancestors--thesuper-high-moral old iron-clads of Cape Cod, the pious buccaneers ofPlymouth Rock--go home, and try to learn to behave!
However, chaff and nonsense aside, I think I honor and appreciate yourPilgrim stock as much as you do yourselves, perhaps; and I endorse andadopt a sentiment uttered by a grandfather of mine once--a man of sturdyopinions, of sincere make of mind, and not given to flattery. He said:"People may talk as they like about that Pilgrim stock, but, after all'ssaid and done, it would be pretty hard to improve on those people; and,as for me, I don't mind coming out flatfooted and saying there ain't anyway to improve on them--except having them born in, Missouri!"
