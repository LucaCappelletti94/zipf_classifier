Is it true that the sun of a man's mentality touches noon atforty and then begins to wane toward setting? Doctor Osler ischarged with saying so. Maybe he said it, maybe he didn't; Idon't know which it is. But if he said it, I can point him to acase which proves his rule. Proves it by being an exception toit. To this place I nominate Mr. Howells.I read his VENETIAN DAYS about forty years ago. I compareit with his paper on Machiavelli in a late number of HARPER, andI cannot find that his English has suffered any impairment. Forforty years his English has been to me a continual delight andastonishment. In the sustained exhibition of certain greatqualities--clearness, compression, verbal exactness, and unforcedand seemingly unconscious felicity of phrasing--he is, in mybelief, without his peer in the English-writing world. SUSTAINED.I entrench myself behind that protecting word. There are otherswho exhibit those great qualities as greatly as he does, but onlyby intervaled distributions of rich moonlight, with stretches ofveiled and dimmer landscape between; whereas Howells's moon sailscloudless skies all night and all the nights.In the matter of verbal exactness Mr. Howells has no superior,I suppose. He seems to be almost always able to find thatelusive and shifty grain of gold, the RIGHT WORD. Others haveto put up with approximations, more or less frequently; hehas better luck. To me, the others are miners working with thegold-pan--of necessity some of the gold washes over and escapes;whereas, in my fancy, he is quicksilver raiding down a riffle--nograin of the metal stands much chance of eluding him. A powerfulagent is the right word: it lights the reader's way and makes itplain; a close approximation to it will answer, and muchtraveling is done in a well-enough fashion by its help, but we donot welcome it and applaud it and rejoice in it as we do when THEright one blazes out on us. Whenever we come upon one of thoseintensely right words in a book or a newspaper the resultingeffect is physical as well as spiritual, and electrically prompt:it tingles exquisitely around through the walls of the mouth andtastes as tart and crisp and good as the autumn-butter thatcreams the sumac-berry. One has no time to examine the word andvote upon its rank and standing, the automatic recognition of itssupremacy is so immediate. There is a plenty of acceptableliterature which deals largely in approximations, but it may belikened to a fine landscape seen through the rain; the right wordwould dismiss the rain, then you would see it better. It doesn'train when Howells is at work.And where does he get the easy and effortless flow of hisspeech? and its cadenced and undulating rhythm? and itsarchitectural felicities of construction, its graces ofexpression, its pemmican quality of compression, and all that?Born to him, no doubt. All in shining good order in thebeginning, all extraordinary; and all just as shining, just asextraordinary today, after forty years of diligent wear and tearand use. He passed his fortieth year long and long ago; but Ithink his English of today--his perfect English, I wish to say--can throw down the glove before his English of that antique timeand not be afraid.I will got back to the paper on Machiavelli now, and ask thereader to examine this passage from it which I append. I do notmean examine it in a bird's-eye way; I mean search it, study it.And, of course, read it aloud. I may be wrong, still it is myconviction that one cannot get out of finely wrought literatureall that is in it by reading it mutely:Mr. Dyer is rather of the opinion, first luminouslysuggested by Macaulay, that Machiavelli was in earnest, but mustnot be judged as a political moralist of our time and race wouldbe judged. He thinks that Machiavelli was in earnest, as nonebut an idealist can be, and he is the first to imagine him anidealist immersed in realities, who involuntarily transmutes theevents under his eye into something like the visionary issues ofreverie. The Machiavelli whom he depicts does not cease to bepolitically a republican and socially a just man because he holdsup an atrocious despot like Caesar Borgia as a mirror for rulers.What Machiavelli beheld round him in Italy was a civic disorderin which there was oppression without statecraft, and revoltwithout patriotism. When a miscreant like Borgia appeared uponthe scene and reduced both tyrants and rebels to an apparentquiescence, he might very well seem to such a dreamer the saviorof society whom a certain sort of dreamers are always lookingfor. Machiavelli was no less honest when he honored thediabolical force than Carlyle was when at different times heextolled the strong man who destroys liberty in creating order.But Carlyle has only just ceased to be mistaken for a reformer,while it is still Machiavelli's hard fate to be so trammeled inhis material that his name stands for whatever is most malevolentand perfidious in human nature.You see how easy and flowing it is; how unvexed by ruggednesses,clumsinesses, broken meters; how simple and--so far as you or Ican make out--unstudied; how clear, how limpid, how understandable,how unconfused by cross-currents, eddies, undertows; how seeminglyunadorned, yet is all adornment, like the lily-of-the-valley;and how compressed, how compact, without a complacency-signalhung out anywhere to call attention to it.There are twenty-three lines in the quoted passage. After readingit several times aloud, one perceives that a good deal of matteris crowded into that small space. I think it is a modelof compactness. When I take its materials apart and work themover and put them together in my way, I find I cannot crowd theresult back into the same hole, there not being room enough. Ifind it a case of a woman packing a man's trunk: he can get thethings out, but he can't ever get them back again.The proffered paragraph is a just and fair sample; the restof the article is as compact as it is; there are no waste words.The sample is just in other ways: limpid, fluent, graceful, andrhythmical as it is, it holds no superiority in these respectsover the rest of the essay. Also, the choice phrasing noticeablein the sample is not lonely; there is a plenty of its kindistributed through the other paragraphs. This is claiming muchwhen that kin must face the challenge of a phrase like the one inthe middle sentence: "an idealist immersed in realities whoinvoluntarily transmutes the events under his eye into somethinglike the visionary issues of reverie." With a hundred words todo it with, the literary artisan could catch that airy thoughtand tie it down and reduce it to a concrete condition, visible,substantial, understandable and all right, like a cabbage; butthe artist does it with twenty, and the result is a flower.The quoted phrase, like a thousand others that have comefrom the same source, has the quality of certain scraps of versewhich take hold of us and stay in our memories, we do notunderstand why, at first: all the words being the right words,none of them is conspicuous, and so they all seem inconspicuous,therefore we wonder what it is about them that makes theirmessage take hold.The mossy marbles restOn the lips that he has prestIn their bloom,And the names he loved to hearHave been carved for many a yearOn the tomb.It is like a dreamy strain of moving music, with no sharpnotes in it. The words are all "right" words, and all the samesize. We do not notice it at first. We get the effect, it goesstraight home to us, but we do not know why. It is when theright words are conspicuous that they thunder:The glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome!When I got back from Howells old to Howells young I find himarranging and clustering English words well, but not any betterthan now. He is not more felicitous in concreting abstractionsnow than he was in translating, then, the visions of the eyes offlesh into words that reproduced their forms and colors:In Venetian streets they give the fallen snow no rest. Itis at once shoveled into the canals by hundreds of half-nakedFACCHINI; and now in St. Mark's Place the music of innumerableshovels smote upon my ear; and I saw the shivering legion ofpoverty as it engaged the elements in a struggle for thepossession of the Piazza. But the snow continued to fall, andthrough the twilight of the descending flakes all this toil andencountered looked like that weary kind of effort in dreams, whenthe most determined industry seems only to renew the task. Thelofty crest of the bell-tower was hidden in the folds of fallingsnow, and I could no longer see the golden angel upon its summit.But looked at across the Piazza, the beautiful outline of St.Mark's Church was perfectly penciled in the air, and the shiftingthreads of the snowfall were woven into a spell of novelenchantment around the structure that always seemed to me tooexquisite in its fantastic loveliness to be anything but thecreation of magic. The tender snow had compassionated thebeautiful edifice for all the wrongs of time, and so hid thestains and ugliness of decay that it looked as if just from thehand of the builder--or, better said, just from the brain of thearchitect. There was marvelous freshness in the colors of themosaics in the great arches of the facade, and all that graciousharmony into which the temple rises, or marble scrolls and leafyexuberance airily supporting the statues of the saints, was ahundred times etherealized by the purity and whiteness of thedrifting flakes. The snow lay lightly on the golden gloves thattremble like peacocks-crests above the vast domes, and plumedthem with softest white; it robed the saints in ermine; and itdanced over all its works, as if exulting in its beauty--beautywhich filled me with subtle, selfish yearning to keep suchevanescent loveliness for the little-while-longer of my wholelife, and with despair to think that even the poor lifelessshadow of it could never be fairly reflected in picture or poem.Through the wavering snowfall, the Saint Theodore upon oneof the granite pillars of the Piazzetta did not show so grim ashis wont is, and the winged lion on the other might have been awinged lamb, so gentle and mild he looked by the tender light ofthe storm. The towers of the island churches loomed faint andfar away in the dimness; the sailors in the rigging of the shipsthat lay in the Basin wrought like phantoms among the shrouds;the gondolas stole in and out of the opaque distance morenoiselessly and dreamily than ever; and a silence, almostpalpable, lay upon the mutest city in the world.The spirit of Venice is there: of a city where Age andDecay, fagged with distributing damage and repulsiveness amongthe other cities of the planet in accordance with the policy andbusiness of their profession, come for rest and play betweenseasons, and treat themselves to the luxury and relaxation ofsinking the shop and inventing and squandering charms all about,instead of abolishing such as they find, as it their habit whennot on vacation.In the working season they do business in Boston sometimes,and a character in THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY takes accurate noteof pathetic effects wrought by them upon the aspects of a streetof once dignified and elegant homes whose occupants have movedaway and left them a prey to neglect and gradual ruin andprogressive degradation; a descent which reaches bottom at last,when the street becomes a roost for humble professionals of thefaith-cure and fortune-telling sort.What a queer, melancholy house, what a queer, melancholystreet! I don't think I was ever in a street before when quiteso many professional ladies, with English surnames, preferredMadam to Mrs. on their door-plates. And the poor old place hassuch a desperately conscious air of going to the deuce. Everyhouse seems to wince as you go by, and button itself up to thechin for fear you should find out it had no shirt on--so tospeak. I don't know what's the reason, but these material tokensof a social decay afflict me terribly; a tipsy woman isn'tdreadfuler than a haggard old house, that's once been a home, ina street like this.Mr. Howells's pictures are not mere stiff, hard, accuratephotographs; they are photographs with feeling in them, andsentiment, photographs taken in a dream, one might say.As concerns his humor, I will not try to say anything, yet Iwould try, if I had the words that might approximately reach upto its high place. I do not think any one else can play withhumorous fancies so gracefully and delicately and deliciously ashe does, nor has so many to play with, nor can come so nearmaking them look as if they were doing the playing themselves andhe was not aware that they were at it. For they are unobtrusive,and quiet in their ways, and well conducted. His is a humorwhich flows softly all around about and over and through the meshof the page, pervasive, refreshing, health-giving, and makes nomore show and no more noise than does the circulation of theblood.There is another thing which is contentingly noticeable inMr. Howells's books. That is his "stage directions"--thoseartifices which authors employ to throw a kind of humannaturalness around a scene and a conversation, and help thereader to see the one and get at meanings in the other whichmight not be perceived if entrusted unexplained to the bare wordsof the talk. Some authors overdo the stage directions, theyelaborate them quite beyond necessity; they spend so much timeand take up so much room in telling us how a person said a thingand how he looked and acted when he said it that we get tired andvexed and wish he hadn't said it all. Other authors' directionsare brief enough, but it is seldom that the brevity containseither wit or information. Writers of this school go in rags, inthe matter of state directions; the majority of them havingnothing in stock but a cigar, a laugh, a blush, and a burstinginto tears. In their poverty they work these sorry things to thebone. They say:". . . replied Alfred, flipping the ash from his cigar."(This explains nothing; it only wastes space.)". . . responded Richard, with a laugh." (There was nothingto laugh about; there never is. The writer puts it in fromhabit--automatically; he is paying no attention to his work; orhe would see that there is nothing to laugh at; often, when aremark is unusually and poignantly flat and silly, he tries todeceive the reader by enlarging the stage direction and makingRichard break into "frenzies of uncontrollable laughter." Thismakes the reader sad.)". . . murmured Gladys, blushing." (This poor old shop-wornblush is a tiresome thing. We get so we would rather Gladyswould fall out of the book and break her neck than do it again.She is always doing it, and usually irrelevantly. Whenever it isher turn to murmur she hangs out her blush; it is the only thingshe's got. In a little while we hate her, just as we doRichard.)". . . repeated Evelyn, bursting into tears." (This kindkeep a book damp all the time. They can't say a thing withoutcrying. They cry so much about nothing that by and by when theyhave something to cry ABOUT they have gone dry; they sob, andfetch nothing; we are not moved. We are only glad.)They gavel me, these stale and overworked stage directions,these carbon films that got burnt out long ago and cannot nowcarry any faintest thread of light. It would be well if theycould be relieved from duty and flung out in the literary backyard to rot and disappear along with the discarded and forgotten"steeds" and "halidomes" and similar stage-properties once sodear to our grandfathers. But I am friendly to Mr. Howells'sstage directions; more friendly to them than to any one else's, Ithink. They are done with a competent and discriminating art,and are faithful to the requirements of a state direction'sproper and lawful office, which is to inform. Sometimes theyconvey a scene and its conditions so well that I believe I couldsee the scene and get the spirit and meaning of the accompanyingdialogue if some one would read merely the stage directions to meand leave out the talk. For instance, a scene like this, fromTHE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY:". . . and she laid her arms with a beseeching gesture onher father's shoulder."". . . she answered, following his gesture with a glance."". . . she said, laughing nervously."". . . she asked, turning swiftly upon him that strange, searching glance."". . . she answered, vaguely."". . . she reluctantly admitted."". . . but her voice died wearily away, and she stood lookinginto his face with puzzled entreaty."Mr. Howells does not repeat his forms, and does not need to;he can invent fresh ones without limit. It is mainly therepetition over and over again, by the third-rates, of worn andcommonplace and juiceless forms that makes their novels such aweariness and vexation to us, I think. We do not mind one or twodeliveries of their wares, but as we turn the pages over and keepon meeting them we presently get tired of them and wish theywould do other things for a change.". . . replied Alfred, flipping the ash from his cigar."". . . responded Richard, with a laugh."". . . murmured Gladys, blushing."". . . repeated Evelyn, bursting into tears."". . . replied the Earl, flipping the ash from his cigar."". . . responded the undertaker, with a laugh."". . . murmured the chambermaid, blushing."". . . repeated the burglar, bursting into tears."". . . replied the conductor, flipping the ash from his cigar."". . . responded Arkwright, with a laugh."". . . murmured the chief of police, blushing."". . . repeated the house-cat, bursting into tears."And so on and so on; till at last it ceases to excite. Ialways notice stage directions, because they fret me and keep metrying to get out of their way, just as the automobiles do. Atfirst; then by and by they become monotonous and I get run over.Mr. Howells has done much work, and the spirit of it is asbeautiful as the make of it. I have held him in admiration andaffection so many years that I know by the number of those yearsthat he is old now; but his heart isn't, nor his pen; and yearsdo not count. Let him have plenty of them; there is profit inthem for us.
