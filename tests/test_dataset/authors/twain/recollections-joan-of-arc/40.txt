The Joyous News Flies Fast
THE GREAT news of Patay was carried over the whole of France in twentyhours, people said. I do not know as to that; but one thing is sure,anyway: the moment a man got it he flew shouting and glorifying God andtold his neighbor; and that neighbor flew with it to the next homestead;and so on and so on without resting the word traveled; and when a man gotit in the night, at what hour soever, he jumped out of his bed and borethe blessed message along. And the joy that went with it was like thelight that flows across the land when an eclipse is receding from theface of the sun; and, indeed, you may say that France had lain in aneclipse this long time; yes, buried in a black gloom which thesebeneficent tidings were sweeping away now before the onrush of theirwhite splendor.
The news beat the flying enemy to Yeuville, and the town rose against itsEnglish masters and shut the gates against their brethren. It flew toMont Pipeau, to Saint Simon, and to this, that, and the other Englishfortress; and straightway the garrison applied the torch and took to thefields and the woods. A detachment of our army occupied Meung andpillaged it.
When we reached Orleans that tow was as much as fifty times insaner withjoy than we had ever seen it before--which is saying much. Night had justfallen, and the illuminations were on so wonderful a scale that we seemedto plow through seas of fire; and as to the noise--the hoarse cheering ofthe multitude, the thundering of cannon, the clash of bells--indeed,there was never anything like it. And everywhere rose a new cry thatburst upon us like a storm when the column entered the gates, andnevermore ceased: "Welcome to Joan of Arc--way for the SAVIOR OF FRANCE!"And there was another cry: "Crecy is avenged! Poitiers is avenged!Agincourt is avenged!--Patay shall live forever!"
Mad? Why, you never could imagine it in the world. The prisoners were inthe center of the column. When that came along and the people caughtsight of their masterful old enemy Talbot, that had made them dance solong to his grim war-music, you may imagine what the uproar was like ifyou can, for I can not describe it. They were so glad to see him thatpresently they wanted to have him out and hang him; so Joan had himbrought up to the front to ride in her protection. They made a strikingpair.
