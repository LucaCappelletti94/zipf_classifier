The spirit of wrath--not the words--is the sin; and the spirit of wrathis cursing. We begin to swear before we can talk. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
November 11. On the road. This train-express goes twenty and one-halfmiles an hour, schedule time; but it is fast enough, the outlook upon seaand land is so interesting, and the cars so comfortable. They are notEnglish, and not American; they are the Swiss combination of the two.A narrow and railed porch along the side, where a person can walkup and down. A lavatory in each car. This is progress; this isnineteenth-century spirit. In New Zealand, these fast expresses run twicea week. It is well to know this if you want to be a bird and fly throughthe country at a 20-mile gait; otherwise you may start on one of the fivewrong days, and then you will get a train that can't overtake its ownshadow.
By contrast, these pleasant cars call to mind the branch-road cars atMaryborough, Australia, and the passengers' talk about the branch-roadand the hotel.
Somewhere on the road to Maryborough I changed for a while to asmoking-carriage. There were two gentlemen there; both riding backward,one at each end of the compartment. They were acquaintances of eachother. I sat down facing the one that sat at the starboard window. Hehad a good face, and a friendly look, and I judged from his dress that hewas a dissenting minister. He was along toward fifty. Of his own motionhe struck a match, and shaded it with his hand for me to light my cigar.I take the rest from my diary:
In order to start conversation I asked him something about Maryborough.He said, in a most pleasant--even musical voice, but with quiet andcultured decision:
"It's a charming town, with a hell of a hotel."
I was astonished. It seemed so odd to hear a minister swear out loud.He went placidly on:
"It's the worst hotel in Australia. Well, one may go further, and say inAustralasia."
"Bad beds?"
"No--none at all. Just sand-bags."
"The pillows, too?"
"Yes, the pillows, too. Just sand. And not a good quality of sand. Itpacks too hard, and has never been screened. There is too much gravel init. It is like sleeping on nuts."
"Isn't there any good sand?"
"Plenty of it. There is as good bed-sand in this region as the world canfurnish. Aerated sand--and loose; but they won't buy it. They wantsomething that will pack solid, and petrify."
"How are the rooms?"
"Eight feet square; and a sheet of iced oil-cloth to step on in themorning when you get out of the sand-quarry."
"As to lights?"
"Coal-oil lamp."
"A good one?"
"No. It's the kind that sheds a gloom."
"I like a lamp that burns all night."
"This one won't. You must blow it out early."
"That is bad. One might want it again in the night. Can't find it inthe dark."
"There's no trouble; you can find it by the stench."
"Wardrobe?"
"Two nails on the door to hang seven suits of clothes on if you've gotthem."
"Bells?"
"There aren't any."
"What do you do when you want service?"
"Shout. But it won't fetch anybody."
"Suppose you want the chambermaid to empty the slopjar?"
"There isn't any slop-jar. The hotels don't keep them. That is, outsideof Sydney and Melbourne."
"Yes, I knew that. I was only talking. It's the oddest thing inAustralia. Another thing: I've got to get up in the dark, in themorning, to take the 5 o'clock train. Now if the boots----"
"There isn't any."
"Well, the porter."
"There isn't any."
"But who will call me?"
"Nobody. You'll call yourself. And you'll light yourself, too.There'll not be a light burning in the halls or anywhere. And if youdon't carry a light, you'll break your neck."
"But who will help me down with my baggage?"
"Nobody. However, I will tell you what to do. In Maryborough there's anAmerican who has lived there half a lifetime; a fine man, and prosperousand popular. He will be on the lookout for you; you won't have anytrouble. Sleep in peace; he will rout you out, and you will make yourtrain. Where is your manager?"
"I left him at Ballarat, studying the language. And besides, he had togo to Melbourne and get us ready for New Zealand. I've not tried topilot myself before, and it doesn't look easy."
"Easy! You've selected the very most difficult piece of railroad inAustralia for your experiment. There are twelve miles of this road whichno man without good executive ability can ever hope--tell me, have yougood executive ability? first-rate executive ability?"
"I--well, I think so, but----"
"That settles it. The tone of----oh, you wouldn't ever make it in theworld. However, that American will point you right, and you'll go.You've got tickets?"
"Yes--round trip; all the way to Sydney."
"Ah, there it is, you see! You are going in the 5 o'clock byCastlemaine--twelve miles--instead of the 7.15 by Ballarat--in order tosave two hours of fooling along the road. Now then, don't interrupt--letme have the floor. You're going to save the government a deal ofhauling, but that's nothing; your ticket is by Ballarat, and it isn'tgood over that twelve miles, and so----"
"But why should the government care which way I go?"
"Goodness knows! Ask of the winds that far away with fragments strewedthe sea, as the boy that stood on the burning deck used to say. Thegovernment chooses to do its railway business in its own way, and itdoesn't know as much about it as the French. In the beginning they triedidiots; then they imported the French--which was going backwards, yousee; now it runs the roads itself--which is going backwards again, yousee. Why, do you know, in order to curry favor with the voters, thegovernment puts down a road wherever anybody wants it--anybody that ownstwo sheep and a dog; and by consequence we've got, in the colony ofVictoria, 800 railway stations, and the business done at eighty of themdoesn't foot up twenty shillings a week."
"Five dollars? Oh, come!"
"It's true. It's the absolute truth."
"Why, there are three or four men on wages at every station."
"I know it. And the station-business doesn't pay for the sheep-dip tosanctify their coffee with. It's just as I say. And accommodating?Why, if you shake a rag the train will stop in the midst of thewilderness to pick you up. All that kind of politics costs, you see.And then, besides, any town that has a good many votes and wants a finestation, gets it. Don't you overlook that Maryborough station, if youtake an interest in governmental curiosities. Why, you can put the wholepopulation of Maryborough into it, and give them a sofa apiece, and haveroom for more. You haven't fifteen stations in America that are as big,and you probably haven't five that are half as fine. Why, it'sperfectly elegant. And the clock! Everybody will show you the clock.There isn't a station in Europe that's got such a clock. It doesn'tstrike--and that's one mercy. It hasn't any bell; and as you'll havecause to remember, if you keep your reason, all Australia is simplybedamned with bells. On every quarter-hour, night and day, they jingle atiresome chime of half a dozen notes--all the clocks in town at once, allthe clocks in Australasia at once, and all the very same notes; first,downward scale: mi, re, do, sol--then upward scale: sol, si, re, do--downagain: mi, re, do, sol--up again: sol, si, re, do--then the clock--say atmidnight clang--clang--clang--clang--clang-clang--clang--clang--clang--clang----and, by that time you're--hello, what's all this excitementabout? a runaway--scared by the train; why, you think this train couldscare anything. Well, when they build eighty stations at a loss and alot of palace-stations and clocks like Maryborough's at another loss, thegovernment has got to economize somewhere hasn't it? Very well look atthe rolling stock. That's where they save the money. Why, that trainfrom Maryborough will consist of eighteen freight-cars and twopassenger-kennels; cheap, poor, shabby, slovenly; no drinking water, nosanitary arrangements, every imaginable inconvenience; and slow?--oh, thegait of cold molasses; no air-brake, no springs, and they'll jolt yourhead off every time they start or stop. That's where they make theirlittle economies, you see. They spend tons of money to house youpalatially while you wait fifteen minutes for a train, then degrade youto six hours' convict-transportation to get the foolish outlay back.What a rational man really needs is discomfort while he's waiting, thenhis journey in a nice train would be a grateful change. But no, thatwould be common sense--and out of place in a government. And then,besides, they save in that other little detail, you know--repudiate theirown tickets, and collect a poor little illegitimate extra shilling out ofyou for that twelve miles, and----"
"Well, in any case----"
"Wait--there's more. Leave that American out of the account and see whatwould happen. There's nobody on hand to examine your ticket when youarrive. But the conductor will come and examine it when the train isready to start. It is too late to buy your extra ticket now; the traincan't wait, and won't. You must climb out."
"But can't I pay the conductor?"
"No, he is not authorized to receive the money, and he won't. You mustclimb out. There's no other way. I tell you, the railway management isabout the only thoroughly European thing here--continentally European Imean, not English. It's the continental business in perfection; downfine. Oh, yes, even to the peanut-commerce of weighing baggage."
The train slowed up at his place. As he stepped out he said:
"Yes, you'll like Maryborough. Plenty of intelligence there. It's acharming place--with a hell of a hotel."
Then he was gone. I turned to the other gentleman:
"Is your friend in the ministry?"
"No--studying for it."
