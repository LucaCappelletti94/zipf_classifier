When Shakespeare died, in 1616, great literary productionsattributed to him as author had been before the London world and inhigh favor for twenty-four years. Yet his death was not an event.It made no stir, it attracted no attention. Apparently his eminentliterary contemporaries did not realize that a celebrated poet hadpassed from their midst. Perhaps they knew a play-actor of minorrank had disappeared, but did not regard him as the author of hisWorks. "We are justified in assuming" this.
His death was not even an event in the little town of Stratford.Does this mean that in Stratford he was not regarded as a celebrityof ANY kind?
"We are privileged to assume"--no, we are indeed OBLIGED to assume--that such was the case. He had spent the first twenty-two ortwenty-three years of his life there, and of course knew everybodyand was known by everybody of that day in the town, including thedogs and the cats and the horses. He had spent the last five orsix years of his life there, diligently trading in every big andlittle thing that had money in it; so we are compelled to assumethat many of the folk there in those said latter days knew himpersonally, and the rest by sight and hearsay. But not as aCELEBRITY? Apparently not. For everybody soon forgot to rememberany contact with him or any incident connected with him. Thedozens of townspeople, still alive, who had known of him or knownabout him in the first twenty-three years of his life were in thesame unremembering condition: if they knew of any incidentconnected with that period of his life they didn't tell about it.Would they if they had been asked? It is most likely. Were theyasked? It is pretty apparent that they were not. Why weren'tthey? It is a very plausible guess that nobody there or elsewherewas interested to know.
For seven years after Shakespeare's death nobody seems to have beeninterested in him. Then the quarto was published, and Ben Jonsonawoke out of his long indifference and sang a song of praise andput it in the front of the book. Then silence fell AGAIN.
For sixty years. Then inquiries into Shakespeare's Stratford lifebegan to be made, of Stratfordians. Of Stratfordians who had knownShakespeare or had seen him? No. Then of Stratfordians who hadseen people who had known or seen people who had seen Shakespeare?No. Apparently the inquiries were only made of Stratfordians whowere not Stratfordians of Shakespeare's day, but later comers; andwhat they had learned had come to them from persons who had notseen Shakespeare; and what they had learned was not claimed asFACT, but only as legend--dim and fading and indefinite legend;legend of the calf-slaughtering rank, and not worth rememberingeither as history or fiction.
Has it ever happened before--or since--that a celebrated person whohad spent exactly half of a fairly long life in the village wherehe was born and reared, was able to slip out of this world andleave that village voiceless and gossipless behind him--utterlyvoiceless, utterly gossipless? And permanently so? I don'tbelieve it has happened in any case except Shakespeare's. Andcouldn't and wouldn't have happened in his case if he had beenregarded as a celebrity at the time of his death.
When I examine my own case--but let us do that, and see if it willnot be recognizable as exhibiting a condition of things quitelikely to result, most likely to result, indeed substantially SUREto result in the case of a celebrated person, a benefactor of thehuman race. Like me.
My parents brought me to the village of Hannibal, Missouri, on thebanks of the Mississippi, when I was two and a half years old. Ientered school at five years of age, and drifted from one school toanother in the village during nine and a half years. Then myfather died, leaving his family in exceedingly straitenedcircumstances; wherefore my book-education came to a standstillforever, and I became a printer's apprentice, on board and clothes,and when the clothes failed I got a hymn-book in place of them.This for summer wear, probably. I lived in Hannibal fifteen and ahalf years, altogether, then ran away, according to the custom ofpersons who are intending to become celebrated. I never livedthere afterward. Four years later I became a "cub" on aMississippi steamboat in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade, andafter a year and a half of hard study and hard work the U. S.inspectors rigorously examined me through a couple of long sittingsand decided that I knew every inch of the Mississippi--thirteenhundred miles--in the dark and in the day--as well as a baby knowsthe way to its mother's paps day or night. So they licensed me asa pilot--knighted me, so to speak--and I rose up clothed withauthority, a responsible servant of the United States government.
Now then. Shakespeare died young--he was only fifty-two. He hadlived in his native village twenty-six years, or about that. Hedied celebrated (if you believe everything you read in the books).Yet when he died nobody there or elsewhere took any notice of it;and for sixty years afterward no townsman remembered to sayanything about him or about his life in Stratford. When theinquirer came at last he got but one fact--no, LEGEND--and got thatone at second hand, from a person who had only heard it as a rumor,and didn't claim copyright in it as a production of his own. Hecouldn't, very well, for its date antedated his own birth-date.But necessarily a number of persons were still alive in Stratfordwho, in the days of their youth, had seen Shakespeare nearly everyday in the last five years of his life, and they would have beenable to tell that inquirer some first-hand things about him if hehad in those last days been a celebrity and therefore a person ofinterest to the villagers. Why did not the inquirer hunt them upand interview them? Wasn't it worth while? Wasn't the matter ofsufficient consequence? Had the inquirer an engagement to see adog-fight and couldn't spare the time?
It all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity,there or elsewhere, and no considerable repute as actor andmanager.
Now then, I am away along in life--my seventy-third year beingalready well behind me--yet SIXTEEN of my Hannibal schoolmates arestill alive to-day, and can tell--and do tell--inquirers dozens anddozens of incidents of their young lives and mine together; thingsthat happened to us in the morning of life, in the blossom of ouryouth, in the good days, the dear days, "the days when we wentgipsying, a long time ago." Most of them creditable to me, too.One child to whom I paid court when she was five years old and Ieight still lives in Hannibal, and she visited me last summer,traversing the necessary ten or twelve hundred miles of railroadwithout damage to her patience or to her old-young vigor. Anotherlittle lassie to whom I paid attention in Hannibal when she wasnine years old and I the same, is still alive--in London--and haleand hearty, just as I am. And on the few surviving steamboats--those lingering ghosts and remembrancers of great fleets that pliedthe big river in the beginning of my water-career--which is exactlyas long ago as the whole invoice of the life-years of Shakespearenumber--there are still findable two or three river-pilots who sawme do creditable things in those ancient days; and several white-headed engineers; and several roustabouts and mates; and severaldeck-hands who used to heave the lead for me and send up on thestill night air the "six--feet--SCANT!" that made me shudder, andthe "M-a-r-k--twain!" that took the shudder away, and presently thedarling "By the d-e-e-p--four!" that lifted me to heaven for joy.{1} They know about me, and can tell. And so do printers, fromSt. Louis to New York; and so do newspaper reporters, from Nevadato San Francisco. And so do the police. If Shakespeare had reallybeen celebrated, like me, Stratford could have told things abouthim; and if my experience goes for anything, they'd have done it.
