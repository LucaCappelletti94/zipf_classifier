We inquired, and learned that the lions of Smyrna consisted of the ruinsof the ancient citadel, whose broken and prodigious battlements frownupon the city from a lofty hill just in the edge of the town--the MountPagus of Scripture, they call it; the site of that one of the SevenApocalyptic Churches of Asia which was located here in the first centuryof the Christian era; and the grave and the place of martyrdom of thevenerable Polycarp, who suffered in Smyrna for his religion some eighteenhundred years ago.
We took little donkeys and started. We saw Polycarp's tomb, and thenhurried on.
The "Seven Churches"--thus they abbreviate it--came next on the list. Werode there--about a mile and a half in the sweltering sun--and visited alittle Greek church which they said was built upon the ancient site; andwe paid a small fee, and the holy attendant gave each of us a little waxcandle as a remembrancer of the place, and I put mine in my hat and thesun melted it and the grease all ran down the back of my neck; and so nowI have not any thing left but the wick, and it is a sorry and awilted-looking wick at that.
Several of us argued as well as we could that the "church" mentioned inthe Bible meant a party of Christians, and not a building; that the Biblespoke of them as being very poor--so poor, I thought, and so subject topersecution (as per Polycarp's martyrdom) that in the first place theyprobably could not have afforded a church edifice, and in the secondwould not have dared to build it in the open light of day if they could;and finally, that if they had had the privilege of building it, commonjudgment would have suggested that they build it somewhere near the town.But the elders of the ship's family ruled us down and scouted ourevidences. However, retribution came to them afterward. They found thatthey had been led astray and had gone to the wrong place; they discoveredthat the accepted site is in the city.
Riding through the town, we could see marks of the six Smyrnas that haveexisted here and been burned up by fire or knocked down by earthquakes.The hills and the rocks are rent asunder in places, excavations exposegreat blocks of building-stone that have lain buried for ages, and allthe mean houses and walls of modern Smyrna along the way are spottedwhite with broken pillars, capitals and fragments of sculptured marblethat once adorned the lordly palaces that were the glory of the city inthe olden time.
The ascent of the hill of the citadel is very steep, and we proceededrather slowly. But there were matters of interest about us. In oneplace, five hundred feet above the sea, the perpendicular bank on theupper side of the road was ten or fifteen feet high, and the cut exposedthree veins of oyster shells, just as we have seen quartz veins exposedin the cutting of a road in Nevada or Montana. The veins were abouteighteen inches thick and two or three feet apart, and they slanted alongdownward for a distance of thirty feet or more, and then disappearedwhere the cut joined the road. Heaven only knows how far a man mighttrace them by "stripping." They were clean, nice oyster shells, large,and just like any other oyster shells. They were thickly massedtogether, and none were scattered above or below the veins. Each one wasa well-defined lead by itself, and without a spur. My first instinct wasto set up the usual-- NOTICE:
 "We, the undersigned, claim five claims of two hundred feet each, (and one for discovery,) on this ledge or lode of oyster-shells, with all its dips, spurs, angles, variations and sinuosities, and fifty feet on each side of the same, to work it, etc., etc., according to the mining laws of Smyrna."
They were such perfectly natural-looking leads that I could hardly keepfrom "taking them up." Among the oyster-shells were mixed many fragmentsof ancient, broken crockery ware. Now how did those masses ofoyster-shells get there? I can not determine. Broken crockery andoyster-shells are suggestive of restaurants--but then they could havehad no such places away up there on that mountain side in our time,because nobody has lived up there. A restaurant would not pay in such astony, forbidding, desolate place. And besides, there were no champagnecorks among the shells. If there ever was a restaurant there, it musthave been in Smyrna's palmy days, when the hills were covered withpalaces. I could believe in one restaurant, on those terms; but then howabout the three? Did they have restaurants there at three differentperiods of the world?--because there are two or three feet of solidearth between the oyster leads. Evidently, the restaurant solution willnot answer.
The hill might have been the bottom of the sea, once, and been lifted up,with its oyster-beds, by an earthquake--but, then, how about thecrockery? And moreover, how about three oyster beds, one above another,and thick strata of good honest earth between?
That theory will not do. It is just possible that this hill is MountArarat, and that Noah's Ark rested here, and he ate oysters and threw theshells overboard. But that will not do, either. There are the threelayers again and the solid earth between--and, besides, there were onlyeight in Noah's family, and they could not have eaten all these oystersin the two or three months they staid on top of that mountain. Thebeasts--however, it is simply absurd to suppose he did not know any morethan to feed the beasts on oyster suppers.
It is painful--it is even humiliating--but I am reduced at last to oneslender theory: that the oysters climbed up there of their own accord.But what object could they have had in view?--what did they want upthere? What could any oyster want to climb a hill for? To climb a hillmust necessarily be fatiguing and annoying exercise for an oyster. Themost natural conclusion would be that the oysters climbed up there tolook at the scenery. Yet when one comes to reflect upon the nature of anoyster, it seems plain that he does not care for scenery. An oyster hasno taste for such things; he cares nothing for the beautiful. An oysteris of a retiring disposition, and not lively--not even cheerful above theaverage, and never enterprising. But above all, an oyster does not takeany interest in scenery--he scorns it. What have I arrived at now?Simply at the point I started from, namely, those oyster shells arethere, in regular layers, five hundred feet above the sea, and no manknows how they got there. I have hunted up the guide-books, and the gistof what they say is this: "They are there, but how they got there is amystery."
Twenty-five years ago, a multitude of people in America put on theirascension robes, took a tearful leave of their friends, and made ready tofly up into heaven at the first blast of the trumpet. But the angel didnot blow it. Miller's resurrection day was a failure. The Milleriteswere disgusted. I did not suspect that there were Millers in Asia Minor,but a gentleman tells me that they had it all set for the world to cometo an end in Smyrna one day about three years ago. There was muchbuzzing and preparation for a long time previously, and it culminated ina wild excitement at the appointed time. A vast number of the populaceascended the citadel hill early in the morning, to get out of the way ofthe general destruction, and many of the infatuated closed up their shopsand retired from all earthly business. But the strange part of it wasthat about three in the afternoon, while this gentleman and his friendswere at dinner in the hotel, a terrific storm of rain, accompanied bythunder and lightning, broke forth and continued with dire fury for twoor three hours. It was a thing unprecedented in Smyrna at that time ofthe year, and scared some of the most skeptical. The streets ran riversand the hotel floor was flooded with water. The dinner had to besuspended. When the storm finished and left every body drenched throughand through, and melancholy and half-drowned, the ascensionists came downfrom the mountain as dry as so many charity-sermons! They had beenlooking down upon the fearful storm going on below, and really believedthat their proposed destruction of the world was proving a grand success.
A railway here in Asia--in the dreamy realm of the Orient--in the fabledland of the Arabian Nights--is a strange thing to think of. And yet theyhave one already, and are building another. The present one is wellbuilt and well conducted, by an English Company, but is not doing animmense amount of business. The first year it carried a good manypassengers, but its freight list only comprised eight hundred pounds offigs!
It runs almost to the very gates of Ephesus--a town great in all ages ofthe world--a city familiar to readers of the Bible, and one which was asold as the very hills when the disciples of Christ preached in itsstreets. It dates back to the shadowy ages of tradition, and was thebirthplace of gods renowned in Grecian mythology. The idea of alocomotive tearing through such a place as this, and waking the phantomsof its old days of romance out of their dreams of dead and gonecenturies, is curious enough.
We journey thither tomorrow to see the celebrated ruins.
