The seasons send their ruin as they go,For in the spring the narciss shows its headNor withers till the rose has flamed to red,And in the autumn purple violets blow,And the slim crocus stirs the winter snow;Wherefore yon leafless trees will bloom againAnd this grey land grow green with summer rainAnd send up cowslips for some boy to mow.
But what of life whose bitter hungry seaFlows at our heels, and gloom of sunless nightCovers the days which never more return?Ambition, love and all the thoughts that burnWe lose too soon, and only find delightIn withered husks of some dead memory.
