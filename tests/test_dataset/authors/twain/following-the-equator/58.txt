Make it a point to do something every day that you don't want to do.This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your dutywithout pain. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

It seems to be settled, now, that among the many causes from which theGreat Mutiny sprang, the main one was the annexation of the kingdom ofOudh by the East India Company--characterized by Sir Henry Lawrence as"the most unrighteous act that was ever committed."  In the spring of1857, a mutinous spirit was observable in many of the native garrisons,and it grew day by day and spread wider and wider.  The younger militarymen saw something very serious in it, and would have liked to take holdof it vigorously and stamp it out promptly; but they were not inauthority. Old-men were in the high places of the army--men who shouldhave been retired long before, because of their great age--and theyregarded the matter as a thing of no consequence.  They loved theirnative soldiers, and would not believe that anything could move them torevolt.  Everywhere these obstinate veterans listened serenely to therumbling of the volcanoes under them, and said it was nothing.
And so the propagators of mutiny had everything their own way.  Theymoved from camp to camp undisturbed, and painted to the native soldierthe wrongs his people were suffering at the hands of the English, andmade his heart burn for revenge.  They were able to point to two facts offormidable value as backers of their persuasions: In Clive's day, nativearmies were incoherent mobs, and without effective arms; therefore, theywere weak against Clive's organized handful of well-armed men, but thething was the other way, now.  The British forces were native; they hadbeen trained by the British, organized by the British, armed by theBritish, all the power was in their hands--they were a club made byBritish hands to beat out British brains with.  There was nothing tooppose their mass, nothing but a few weak battalions of British soldiersscattered about India, a force not worth speaking of.  This argument,taken alone, might not have succeeded, for the bravest and best Indiantroops had a wholesome dread of the white soldier, whether he was weak orstrong; but the agitators backed it with their second and best pointprophecy--a prophecy a hundred years old.  The Indian is open to prophecyat all times; argument may fail to convince him, but not prophecy.  Therewas a prophecy that a hundred years from the year of that battle ofClive's which founded the British Indian Empire, the British power wouldbe overthrown and swept away by the natives.
The Mutiny broke out at Meerut on the 10th of May, 1857, and fired atrain of tremendous historical explosions.  Nana Sahib's massacre of thesurrendered garrison of Cawnpore occurred in June, and the long siege ofLucknow began.  The military history of England is old and great, but Ithink it must be granted that the crushing of the Mutiny is the greatestchapter in it.  The British were caught asleep and unprepared.  They werea few thousands, swallowed up in an ocean of hostile populations.  Itwould take months to inform England and get help, but they did not falteror stop to count the odds, but with English resolution and Englishdevotion they took up their task, and went stubbornly on with it, throughgood fortune and bad, and fought the most unpromising fight that one mayread of in fiction or out of it, and won it thoroughly.
The Mutiny broke out so suddenly, and spread with such rapidity thatthere was but little time for occupants of weak outlying stations toescape to places of safety.  Attempts were made, of course, but they wereattended by hardships as bitter as death in the few cases which weresuccessful; for the heat ranged between 120 and 138 in the shade; the wayled through hostile peoples, and food and water were hardly to be had.For ladies and children accustomed to ease and comfort and plenty, such ajourney must have been a cruel experience.  Sir G. O.  Trevelyan quotesan example:
     "This is what befell Mrs. M----, the wife of the surgeon at a     certain station on the southern confines of the insurrection.  'I     heard,' she says, 'a number of shots fired, and, looking out, I saw     my husband driving furiously from the mess-house, waving his whip.     I ran to him, and, seeing a bearer with my child in his arms, I     caught her up, and got into the buggy.  At the mess-house we found     all the officers assembled, together with sixty sepoys, who had     remained faithful.  We went off in one large party, amidst a general     conflagration of our late homes.  We reached the caravanserai at     Chattapore the next morning, and thence started for Callinger.  At     this point our sepoy escort deserted us.  We were fired upon by     match-lockmen, and one officer was shot dead.  We heard, likewise,     that the people had risen at Callinger, so we returned and walked     back ten miles that day.  M---- and I carried the child alternately.     Presently Mrs. Smalley died of sunstroke.  We had no food amongst     us.  An officer kindly lent us a horse.  We were very faint.  The     Major died, and was buried; also the Sergeant-major and some women.     The bandsmen left us on the nineteenth of June.  We were fired at     again by match-lockmen, and changed direction for Allahabad.  Our     party consisted of nine gentlemen, two children, the sergeant and     his wife.  On the morning of the twentieth, Captain Scott took     Lottie on to his horse.  I was riding behind my husband, and she was     so crushed between us.  She was two years old on the first of the     month.  We were both weak through want of food and the effect of the     sun.  Lottie and I had no head covering.  M---- had a sepoy's cap I     found on the ground.  Soon after sunrise we were followed by     villagers armed with clubs and spears.  One of them struck Captain     Scott's horse on the leg.  He galloped off with Lottie, and my poor     husband never saw his child again.  We rode on several miles,     keeping away from villages, and then crossed the river.  Our thirst     was extreme.  M---- had dreadful cramps, so that I had to hold him     on the horse.  I was very uneasy about him.  The day before I saw     the drummer's wife eating chupatties, and asked her to give a piece     to the child, which she did.  I now saw water in a ravine.  The     descent was steep, and our only drinkingvessel was M----'s cap.  Our     horse got water, and I bathed my neck.  I had no stockings, and my     feet were torn and blistered.  Two peasants came in sight, and we     were frightened and rode off.  The sergeant held our horse, and     M---- put me up and mounted.  I think he must have got suddenly faint,     for I fell and he over me, on the road, when the horse started off.     Some time before he said, and Barber, too, that he could not live     many hours.  I felt he was dying before we came to the ravine.  He     told me his wishes about his children and myself, and took leave.     My brain seemed burnt up.  No tears came.  As soon as we fell, the     sergeant let go the horse, and it went off; so that escape was cut     off.  We sat down on the ground waiting for death.  Poor fellow! he     was very weak; his thirst was frightful, and I went to get him     water.  Some villagers came, and took my rupees and watch.  I took     off my wedding-ring, and twisted it in my hair, and replaced the     guard.  I tore off the skirt of my dress to bring water in, but was     no use, for when I returned my beloved's eyes were fixed, and,     though I called and tried to restore him, and poured water into his     mouth, it only rattled in his throat.  He never spoke to me again.     I held him in my arms till he sank gradually down.  I felt frantic,     but could not cry.  I was alone.  I bound his head and face in my     dress, for there was no earth to buy him.  The pain in my hands and     feet was dreadful.  I went down to the ravine, and sat in the water     on a stone, hoping to get off at night and look for Lottie.  When I     came back from the water, I saw that they had not taken her little     watch, chain, and seals, so I tied them under my petticoat.  In an     hour, about thirty villagers came, they dragged me out of the     ravine, and took off my jacket, and found the little chain.  They     then dragged me to a village, mocking me all the way, and disputing     as to whom I was to belong to.  The whole population came to look at     me.  I asked for a bedstead, and lay down outside the door of a hut.     They had a dozen of cows, and yet refused me milk.  When night came,     and the village was quiet, some old woman brought me a leafful of     rice.  I was too parched to eat, and they gave me water.  The     morning after a neighboring Rajah sent a palanquin and a horseman to     fetch me, who told me that a little child and three Sahibs had come     to his master's house.  And so the poor mother found her lost one,     'greatly blistered,' poor little creature.  It is not for Europeans     in India to pray that their flight be not in the winter."
In the first days of June the aged general, Sir Hugh Wheeler commandingthe forces at Cawnpore, was deserted by his native troops; then he movedout of the fort and into an exposed patch of open flat ground and built afour-foot mud wall around it.  He had with him a few hundred whitesoldiers and officers, and apparently more women and children thansoldiers.  He was short of provisions, short of arms, short ofammunition, short of military wisdom, short of everything but courage anddevotion to duty.  The defense of that open lot through twenty-one daysand nights of hunger, thirst, Indian heat, and a never-ceasing storm ofbullets, bombs, and cannon-balls--a defense conducted, not by the agedand infirm general, but by a young officer named Moore--is one of themost heroic episodes in history.  When at last the Nana found itimpossible to conquer these starving men and women with powder and ball,he resorted to treachery, and that succeeded.  He agreed to supply themwith food and send them to Allahabad in boats.  Their mud wall and theirbarracks were in ruins, their provisions were at the point of exhaustion,they had done all that the brave could do, they had conquered anhonorable compromise,--their forces had been fearfully reduced bycasualties and by disease, they were not able to continue the contestlonger.  They came forth helpless but suspecting no treachery, the Nana'shost closed around them, and at a signal from a trumpet the massacrebegan.  About two hundred women and children were spared--for thepresent--but all the men except three or four were killed.  Among theincidents of the massacre quoted by Sir G. O. Trevelyan, is this:
     "When, after the lapse of some twenty minutes, the dead began to     outnumber the living;--when the fire slackened, as the marks grew     few and far between; then the troopers who had been drawn up to the     right of the temple plunged into the river, sabre between teeth, and     pistol in hand.  Thereupon two half-caste Christian women, the wives     of musicians in the band of the Fifty-sixth, witnessed a scene which     should not be related at second-hand.  'In the boat where I was to     have gone,' says Mrs. Bradshaw, confirmed throughout by Mrs. Betts,     'was the school-mistress and twenty-two misses.  General Wheeler     came last in a palkee.  They carried him into the water near the     boat.  I stood close by.  He said, 'Carry me a little further     towards the boat.' But a trooper said, 'No, get out here.'  As the     General got out of the palkee, head-foremost, the trooper gave him a     cut with his sword into the neck, and he fell into the water.  My     son was killed near him.  I saw it; alas! alas!  Some were stabbed     with bayonets; others cut down.  Little infants were torn in pieces.     We saw it; we did; and tell you only what we saw.  Other children     were stabbed and thrown into the river.  The schoolgirls were burnt     to death.  I saw their clothes and hair catch fire.  In the water, a     few paces off, by the next boat, we saw the youngest daughter of     Colonel Williams.  A sepoy was going to kill her with his bayonet.     She said, 'My father was always kind to sepoys.'  He turned away,     and just then a villager struck her on the head with a club, and she     fell into the water.  These people likewise saw good Mr. Moncrieff,     the clergyman, take a book from his pocket that he never had leisure     to open, and heard him commence a prayer for mercy which he was not     permitted to conclude.  Another deponent observed an European making     for a drain like a scared water-rat, when some boatmen, armed with     cudgels, cut off his retreat, and beat him down dead into the mud."
The women and children who had been reserved from the massacre wereimprisoned during a fortnight in a small building, one story high--acramped place, a slightly modified Black Hole of Calcutta.  They werewaiting in suspense; there was none who could foretaste their fate.Meantime the news of the massacre had traveled far and an army ofrescuers with Havelock at its head was on its way--at least an army whichhoped to be rescuers.  It was crossing the country by forced marches, andstrewing its way with its own dead men struck down by cholera, and by aheat which reached 135 deg.  It was in a vengeful fury, and it stoppedfor nothing neither heat, nor fatigue, nor disease, nor human opposition.It tore its impetuous way through hostile forces, winning victory aftervictory, but still striding on and on, not halting to count results.  Andat last, after this extraordinary march, it arrived before the walls ofCawnpore, met the Nana's massed strength, delivered a crushing defeat,and entered.
But too late--only a few hours too late.  For at the last moment the Nanahad decided upon the massacre of the captive women and children, and hadcommissioned three Mohammedans and two Hindoos to do the work.  Sir G.O. Trevelyan says:
     "Thereupon the five men entered.  It was the short gloaming of     Hindostan--the hour when ladies take their evening drive.  She who     had accosted the officer was standing in the doorway.  With her were     the native doctor and two Hindoo menials.  That much of the business     might be seen from the veranda, but all else was concealed amidst     the interior gloom.  Shrieks and scuffing acquainted those without     that the journeymen were earning their hire.  Survur Khan soon     emerged with his sword broken off at the hilt.  He procured another     from the Nana's house, and a few minutes after appeared again on the     same errand.  The third blade was of better temper; or perhaps the     thick of the work was already over.  By the time darkness had closed     in, the men came forth and locked up the house for the night.  Then     the screams ceased, but the groans lasted till morning.
     "The sun rose as usual.  When he had been up nearly three hours the     five repaired to the scene of their labors over night.  They were     attended by a few sweepers, who proceeded to transfer the contents     of the house to a dry well situated behind some trees which grew     hard by.  'The bodies,' says one who was present throughout, 'were     dragged out, most of them by the hair of the head.  Those who had     clothing worth taking were stripped.  Some of the women were alive.     I cannot say how many; but three could speak.  They prayed for the     sake of God that an end might be put to their sufferings.  I     remarked one very stout woman, a half-caste, who was severely     wounded in both arms, who entreated to be killed.  She and two or     three others were placed against the bank of the cut by which     bullocks go down in drawing water.  The dead were first thrown in.     Yes: there was a great crowd looking on; they were standing along     the walls of the compound.  They were principally city people and     villagers.  Yes: there were also sepoys.  Three boys were alive.     They were fair children.  The eldest, I think, must have been six or     seven, and the youngest five years.  They were running around the     well (where else could they go to?), and there was none to save     them.  No one said a word or tried to save them.'
     "At length the smallest of them made an infantile attempt to get     away.  The little thing had been frightened past bearing by the     murder of one of the surviving ladies.  He thus attracted the     observation of a native who flung him and his companions down the     well."
The soldiers had made a march of eighteen days, almost without rest, tosave the women and the children, and now they were too late--all weredead and the assassin had flown.  What happened then, Trevelyan hesitatedto put into words.  "Of what took place, the less said is the better."
Then he continues:
     "But there was a spectacle to witness which might excuse much.     Those who, straight from the contested field, wandered sobbing     through the rooms of the ladies' house, saw what it were well could     the outraged earth have straightway hidden.  The inner apartment was     ankle-deep in blood.  The plaster was scored with sword-cuts; not     high up as where men have fought, but low down, and about the     corners, as if a creature had crouched to avoid the blow.  Strips of     dresses, vainly tied around the handles of the doors, signified the     contrivance to which feminine despair had resorted as a means of     keeping out the murderers.  Broken combs were there, and the frills     of children's trousers, and torn cuffs and pinafores, and little     round hats, and one or two shoes with burst latchets, and one or two     daguerreotype cases with cracked glasses.  An officer picked up a     few curls, preserved in a bit of cardboard, and marked 'Ned's hair,     with love'; but around were strewn locks, some near a yard in     length, dissevered, not as a keepsake, by quite other scissors."
The battle of Waterloo was fought on the 18th of June, 1815.  I do notstate this fact as a reminder to the reader, but as news to him.  For aforgotten fact is news when it comes again.  Writers of books have thefashion of whizzing by vast and renowned historical events with theremark, "The details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to thereader to need repeating here."  They know that that is not true.  It isa low kind of flattery.  They know that the reader has forgotten everydetail of it, and that nothing of the tremendous event is left in hismind but a vague and formless luminous smudge.  Aside from the desire toflatter the reader, they have another reason for making the remark-tworeasons, indeed.  They do not remember the details themselves, and do notwant the trouble of hunting them up and copying them out; also, they areafraid that if they search them out and print them they will be scoffedat by the book-reviewers for retelling those worn old things which arefamiliar to everybody.  They should not mind the reviewer's jeer; hedoesn't remember any of the worn old things until the book which he isreviewing has retold them to him.
I have made the quoted remark myself, at one time and another, but I wasnot doing it to flatter the reader; I was merely doing it to save work.If I had known the details without brushing up, I would have put them in;but I didn't, and I did not want the labor of posting myself; so I said,"The details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to the reader toneed repeating here."  I do not like that kind of a lie; still, it doessave work.
I am not trying to get out of repeating the details of the Siege ofLucknow in fear of the reviewer; I am not leaving them out in fear thatthey would not interest the reader; I am leaving them out partly to savework; mainly for lack of room.  It is a pity, too; for there is not adull place anywhere in the great story.
Ten days before the outbreak (May 10th) of the Mutiny, all was serene atLucknow, the huge capital of Oudh, the kingdom which had recently beenseized by the India Company.  There was a great garrison, composed ofabout 7,000 native troops and between 700 and 800 whites.  These whitesoldiers and their families were probably the only people of their racethere; at their elbow was that swarming population of warlike natives, arace of born soldiers, brave, daring, and fond of fighting.  On highground just outside the city stood the palace of that great personage,the Resident, the representative of British power and authority.  Itstood in the midst of spacious grounds, with its due complement ofoutbuildings, and the grounds were enclosed by a wall--a wall not fordefense, but for privacy.  The mutinous spirit was in the air, but thewhites were not afraid, and did not feel much troubled.
Then came the outbreak at Meerut, then the capture of Delhi by themutineers; in June came the three-weeks leaguer of Sir Hugh Wheeler inhis open lot at Cawnpore--40 miles distant from Lucknow--then thetreacherous massacre of that gallant little garrison; and now the greatrevolt was in full flower, and the comfortable condition of things atLucknow was instantly changed.
There was an outbreak there, and Sir Henry Lawrence marched out of theResidency on the 30th of June to put it down, but was defeated with heavyloss, and had difficulty in getting back again.  That night the memorablesiege of the Residency--called the siege of Lucknow--began.  Sir Henrywas killed three days later, and Brigadier Inglis succeeded him incommand.
Outside of the Residency fence was an immense host of hostile andconfident native besiegers; inside it were 480 loyal native soldiers, 730white ones, and 500 women and children.
In those days the English garrisons always managed to hamper themselvessufficiently with women and children.
The natives established themselves in houses close at hand and began torain bullets and cannon-balls into the Residency; and this they kept up,night and day, during four months and a half, the little garrisonindustriously replying all the time.  The women and children soon becameso used to the roar of the guns that it ceased to disturb their sleep.The children imitated siege and defense in their play.  The women--withany pretext, or with none--would sally out into the storm-swept grounds.The defense was kept up week after week, with stubborn fortitude, in themidst of death, which came in many forms--by bullet, small-pox, cholera,and by various diseases induced by unpalatable and insufficient food, bythe long hours of wearying and exhausting overwork in the daily andnightly battle in the oppressive Indian heat, and by the broken restcaused by the intolerable pest of mosquitoes, flies, mice, rats, andfleas.
Six weeks after the beginning of the siege more than one-half of theoriginal force of white soldiers was dead, and close upon three-fifths ofthe original native force.
But the fighting went on just the same.  The enemy mined, the Englishcounter-mined, and, turn about, they blew up each other's posts.  TheResidency grounds were honey-combed with the enemy's tunnels.  Deadlycourtesies were constantly exchanged--sorties by the English in thenight; rushes by the enemy in the night--rushes whose purpose was tobreach the walls or scale them; rushes which cost heavily, and alwaysfailed.
The ladies got used to all the horrors of war--the shrieks of mutilatedmen, the sight of blood and death.  Lady Inglis makes this mention in herdiary:
     "Mrs. Bruere's nurse was carried past our door to-day, wounded in     the eye.  To extract the bullet it was found necessary to take out     the eye--a fearful operation.  Her mistress held her while it was     performed."
The first relieving force failed to relieve.  It was under Havelock andOutram; and arrived when the siege had been going on for three months.It fought its desperate way to Lucknow, then fought its way through thecity against odds of a hundred to one, and entered the Residency; butthere was not enough left of it, then, to do any good.  It lost more menin its last fight than it found in the Residency when it got in.  Itbecame captive itself.
The fighting and starving and dying by bullets and disease went steadilyon.  Both sides fought with energy and industry.  Captain Birch puts thisstriking incident in evidence.  He is speaking of the third month of thesiege:
     "As an instance of the heavy firing brought to bear on our position     this month may be mentioned the cutting down of the upper story of a     brick building simply by musketry firring.  This building was in a     most exposed position.  All the shots which just missed the top of     the rampart cut into the dead wall pretty much in a straight line,     and at length cut right through and brought the upper story tumbling     down.  The upper structure on the top of the brigade-mess also fell     in.  The Residency house was a wreck.  Captain Anderson's post had     long ago been knocked down, and Innes' post also fell in.  These two     were riddled with round shot.  As many as 200 were picked up by     Colonel Masters."
The exhausted garrison fought doggedly on all through the next monthOctober.  Then, November 2d, news came Sir Colin Campbell's relievingforce would soon be on its way from Cawnpore.
On the 12th the boom of his guns was heard.
On the 13th the sounds came nearer--he was slowly, but steadily, cuttinghis way through, storming one stronghold after another.
On the 14th he captured the Martiniere College, and ran up the Britishflag there.  It was seen from the Residency.
Next he took the Dilkoosha.
On the 17th he took the former mess-house of the 32d regiment--afortified building, and very strong.  "A most exciting, anxious day,"writes Lady Inglis in her diary.  "About 4 P.M., two strange officerswalked through our yard, leading their horses"--and by that sign she knewthat communication was established between the forces, that the reliefwas real, this time, and that the long siege of Lucknow was ended.
The last eight or ten miles of Sir Colin Campbell's march was throughseas of, blood.  The weapon mainly used was the bayonet, the fighting wasdesperate.  The way was mile-stoned with detached strong buildings ofstone, fortified, and heavily garrisoned, and these had to be taken byassault.  Neither side asked for quarter, and neither gave it.  At theSecundrabagh, where nearly two thousand of the enemy occupied a greatstone house in a garden, the work of slaughter was continued until everyman was killed.  That is a sample of the character of that devastatingmarch.
There were but few trees in the plain at that time, and from theResidency the progress of the march, step by step, victory by victory,could be noted; the ascending clouds of battle-smoke marked the way tothe eye, and the thunder of the guns marked it to the ear.
Sir Colin Campbell had not come to Lucknow to hold it, but to save theoccupants of the Residency, and bring them away.  Four or five days afterhis arrival the secret evacuation by the troops took place, in the middleof a dark night, by the principal gate, (the Bailie Guard).  The twohundred women and two hundred and fifty children had been previouslyremoved.  Captain Birch says:
     "And now commenced a movement of the most perfect arrangement and     successful generalship--the withdrawal of the whole of the various     forces, a combined movement requiring the greatest care and skill.     First, the garrison in immediate contact with the enemy at the     furthest extremity of the Residency position was marched out.  Every     other garrison in turn fell in behind it, and so passed out through     the Bailie Guard gate, till the whole of our position was evacuated.     Then Havelock's force was similarly withdrawn, post by post,     marching in rear of our garrison.  After them in turn came the     forces of the Commander-in-Chief, which joined on in the rear of     Havelock's force.  Regiment by regiment was withdrawn with--the     utmost order and regularity.  The whole operation resembled the     movement of a telescope.  Stern silence was kept, and the enemy took     no alarm."
Lady Inglis, referring to her husband and to General Sir James Outram,sets down the closing detail of this impressive midnight retreat, indarkness and by stealth, of this shadowy host through the gate which ithad defended so long and so well:
     "At twelve precisely they marched out, John and Sir James Outram     remaining till all had passed, and then they took off their hats to     the Bailie Guard, the scene of as noble a defense as I think history     will ever have to relate."
