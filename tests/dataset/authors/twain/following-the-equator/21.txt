Man will do many things to get himself loved, he will do all things toget himself envied. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

Before I saw Australia I had never heard of the "weet-weet" at all.I met but few men who had seen it thrown--at least I met but few whomentioned having seen it thrown.  Roughly described, it is a fat woodencigar with its butt-end fastened to a flexible twig.  The whole thing isonly a couple of feet long, and weighs less than two ounces.  Thisfeather--so to call it--is not thrown through the air, but is flung withan underhanded throw and made to strike the ground a little way in frontof the thrower; then it glances and makes a long skip; glances again,skips again, and again and again, like the flat stone which a boy sendsskating over the water.  The water is smooth, and the stone has a goodchance; so a strong man may make it travel fifty or seventy-five yards;but the weet-weet has no such good chance, for it strikes sand, grass,and earth in its course.  Yet an expert aboriginal has sent it a measureddistance of two hundred and twenty yards.  It would have gone evenfurther but it encountered rank ferns and underwood on its passage andthey damaged its speed.  Two hundred and twenty yards; and so weightlessa toy--a mouse on the end of a bit of wire, in effect; and not sailingthrough the accommodating air, but encountering grass and sand and stuffat every jump.  It looks wholly impossible; but Mr. Brough Smyth saw thefeat and did the measuring, and set down the facts in his book aboutaboriginal life, which he wrote by command of the Victorian Government.
What is the secret of the feat?  No one explains.  It cannot be physicalstrength, for that could not drive such a feather-weight any distance.It must be art.  But no one explains what the art of it is; nor how itgets around that law of nature which says you shall not throw anytwo-ounce thing 220 yards, either through the air or bumping along theground.  Rev. J. G. Woods says:
"The distance to which the weet-weet or kangaroo-rat can be thrown istruly astonishing.  I have seen an Australian stand at one side ofKennington Oval and throw the kangaroo rat completely across it." (Widthof Kensington Oval not stated.)  "It darts through the air with the sharpand menacing hiss of a rifle-ball, its greatest height from the groundbeing some seven or eight feet .  .  .  .  .  .  When properly thrown itlooks just like a living animal leaping along .  .  .  .  .  .  Itsmovements have a wonderful resemblance to the long leaps of akangaroo-rat fleeing in alarm, with its long tail trailing behind it."
The Old Settler said that he had seen distances made by the weet-weet, inthe early days, which almost convinced him that it was as extraordinaryan instrument as the boomerang.
There must have been a large distribution of acuteness among those nakedskinny aboriginals, or they couldn't have been such unapproachabletrackers and boomerangers and weet-weeters.  It must have beenrace-aversion that put upon them a good deal of the low-rate intellectualreputation which they bear and have borne this long time in the world'sestimate of them.
They were lazy--always lazy.  Perhaps that was their trouble.  It is akilling defect.  Surely they could have invented and built a competenthouse, but they didn't.  And they could have invented and developed theagricultural arts, but they didn't.  They went naked and houseless, andlived on fish and grubs and worms and wild fruits, and were just plainsavages, for all their smartness.
With a country as big as the United States to live and multiply in, andwith no epidemic diseases among them till the white man came with thoseand his other appliances of civilization, it is quite probable that therewas never a day in his history when he could muster 100,000 of his racein all Australia.  He diligently and deliberately kept population down byinfanticide--largely; but mainly by certain other methods.  He did notneed to practise these artificialities any more after the white man came.The white man knew ways of keeping down population which were worthseveral of his.  The white man knew ways of reducing a native population80 percent. in 20 years.  The native had never seen anything as fine asthat before.
For example, there is the case of the country now called Victoria--acountry eighty times as large as Rhode Island, as I have already said.By the best official guess there were 4,500 aboriginals in it when thewhites came along in the middle of the 'Thirties.  Of these, 1,000 livedin Gippsland, a patch of territory the size of fifteen or sixteen RhodeIslands: they did not diminish as fast as some of the other communities;indeed, at the end of forty years there were still 200 of them left.  TheGeelong tribe diminished more satisfactorily: from 173 persons it fadedto 34 in twenty years; at the end of another twenty the tribe numberedone person altogether.  The two Melbourne tribes could muster almost 300when the white man came; they could muster but twenty, thirty-seven yearslater, in 1875.  In that year there were still odds and ends of tribesscattered about the colony of Victoria, but I was told that natives offull blood are very scarce now.  It is said that the aboriginals continuein some force in the huge territory called Queensland.
The early whites were not used to savages.  They could not understand theprimary law of savage life: that if a man do you a wrong, his whole tribeis responsible--each individual of it--and you may take your change outof any individual of it, without bothering to seek out the guilty one.When a white killed an aboriginal, the tribe applied the ancient law, andkilled the first white they came across.  To the whites this was amonstrous thing.  Extermination seemed to be the proper medicine for suchcreatures as this.  They did not kill all the blacks, but they promptlykilled enough of them to make their own persons safe.  From the dawn ofcivilization down to this day the white man has always used that veryprecaution.  Mrs. Campbell Praed lived in Queensland, as a child, in theearly days, and in her "Sketches of Australian life," we get informingpictures of the early struggles of the white and the black to reform eachother.
Speaking of pioneer days in the mighty wilderness of Queensland, Mrs.Praed says:
     "At first the natives retreated before the whites; and, except that     they every now and then speared a beast in one of the herds, gave     little cause for uneasiness.  But, as the number of squatters     increased, each one taking up miles of country and bringing two or     three men in his train, so that shepherds' huts and stockmen's camps     lay far apart, and defenseless in the midst of hostile tribes, the     Blacks' depredations became more frequent and murder was no unusual     event.
     "The loneliness of the Australian bush can hardly be painted in     words.  Here extends mile after mile of primeval forest where     perhaps foot of white man has never trod--interminable vistas where     the eucalyptus trees rear their lofty trunks and spread forth their     lanky limbs, from which the red gum oozes and hangs in fantastic     pendants like crimson stalactites; ravines along the sides of which     the long-bladed grass grows rankly; level untimbered plains     alternating with undulating tracts of pasture, here and there broken     by a stony ridge, steep gully, or dried-up creek.  All wild, vast     and desolate; all the same monotonous gray coloring, except where     the wattle, when in blossom, shows patches of feathery gold, or a     belt of scrub lies green, glossy, and impenetrable as Indian jungle.
     "The solitude seems intensified by the strange sounds of reptiles,     birds, and insects, and by the absence of larger creatures; of which     in the day-time, the only audible signs are the stampede of a herd     of kangaroo, or the rustle of a wallabi, or a dingo stirring the     grass as it creeps to its lair.  But there are the whirring of     locusts, the demoniac chuckle of the laughing jack-ass, the     screeching of cockatoos and parrots, the hissing of the frilled     lizard, and the buzzing of innumerable insects hidden under the     dense undergrowth. And then at night, the melancholy wailing of the     curlews, the dismal howling of dingoes, the discordant croaking of     tree-frogs, might well shake the nerves of the solitary watcher."
That is the theater for the drama.  When you comprehend one or two otherdetails, you will perceive how well suited for trouble it was, and howloudly it invited it.  The cattlemen's stations were scattered over thatprofound wilderness miles and miles apart--at each station half a dozenpersons.  There was a plenty of cattle, the black natives were alwaysill-nourished and hungry.  The land belonged to them.  The whites had notbought it, and couldn't buy it; for the tribes had no chiefs, nobody inauthority, nobody competent to sell and convey; and the tribes themselveshad no comprehension of the idea of transferable ownership of land.  Theousted owners were despised by the white interlopers, and this opinionwas not hidden under a bushel.  More promising materials for a tragedycould not have been collated.  Let Mrs. Praed speak:
     "At Nie station, one dark night, the unsuspecting hut-keeper,     having, as he believed, secured himself against assault, was lying     wrapped in his blankets sleeping profoundly.  The Blacks crept     stealthily down the chimney and battered in his skull while he     slept."
One could guess the whole drama from that little text.  The curtain wasup.  It would not fall until the mastership of one party or the other wasdetermined--and permanently:
     "There was treachery on both sides.  The Blacks killed the Whites     when they found them defenseless, and the Whites slew the Blacks in     a wholesale and promiscuous fashion which offended against my     childish sense of justice.
     "They were regarded as little above the level of brutes, and in some     cases were destroyed like vermin.
     "Here is an instance.  A squatter, whose station was surrounded by     Blacks, whom he suspected to be hostile and from whom he feared an     attack, parleyed with them from his house-door.  He told them it was     Christmas-time--a time at which all men, black or white, feasted;     that there were flour, sugar-plums, good things in plenty in the     store, and that he would make for them such a pudding as they had     never dreamed of--a great pudding of which all might eat and be     filled.  The Blacks listened and were lost.  The pudding was made     and distributed.  Next morning there was howling in the camp, for it     had been sweetened with sugar and arsenic!"
The white man's spirit was right, but his method was wrong.  His spiritwas the spirit which the civilized white has always exhibited toward thesavage, but the use of poison was a departure from custom.  True, it wasmerely a technical departure, not a real one; still, it was a departure,and therefore a mistake, in my opinion.  It was better, kinder, swifter,and much more humane than a number of the methods which have beensanctified by custom, but that does not justify its employment.  That is,it does not wholly justify it.  Its unusual nature makes it stand out andattract an amount of attention which it is not entitled to.  It takeshold upon morbid imaginations and they work it up into a sort ofexhibition of cruelty, and this smirches the good name of ourcivilization, whereas one of the old harsher methods would have had nosuch effect because usage has made those methods familiar to us andinnocent.  In many countries we have chained the savage and starved himto death; and this we do not care for, because custom has inured us toit; yet a quick death by poison is loving-kindness to it.  In manycountries we have burned the savage at the stake; and this we do not carefor, because custom has inured us to it; yet a quick death isloving-kindness to it.  In more than one country we have hunted thesavage and his little children and their mother with dogs and gunsthrough the woods and swamps for an afternoon's sport, and filled theregion with happy laughter over their sprawling and stumbling flight, andtheir wild supplications for mercy; but this method we do not mind,because custom has inured us to it; yet a quick death by poison isloving-kindness to it.  In many countries we have taken the savage's landfrom him, and made him our slave, and lashed him every day, and brokenhis pride, and made death his only friend, and overworked him till hedropped in his tracks; and this we do not care for, because custom hasinured us to it; yet a quick death by poison is loving-kindness to it.In the Matabeleland today--why, there we are confining ourselves tosanctified custom, we Rhodes-Beit millionaires in South Africa and Dukesin London; and nobody cares, because we are used to the old holy customs,and all we ask is that no notice-inviting new ones shall be intruded uponthe attention of our comfortable consciences.  Mrs. Praed says of thepoisoner, "That squatter deserves to have his name handed down to thecontempt of posterity."
I am sorry to hear her say that.  I myself blame him for one thing, andseverely, but I stop there.  I blame him for, the indiscretion ofintroducing a novelty which was calculated to attract attention to ourcivilization.  There was no occasion to do that.  It was his duty, and itis every loyal man's duty to protect that heritage in every way he can;and the best way to do that is to attract attention elsewhere.  Thesquatter's judgment was bad--that is plain; but his heart was right.  Heis almost the only pioneering representative of civilization in historywho has risen above the prejudices of his caste and his heredity andtried to introduce the element of mercy into the superior race's dealingswith the savage.  His name is lost, and it is a pity; for it deserves tobe handed down to posterity with homage and reverence.
This paragraph is from a London journal:
     "To learn what France is doing to spread the blessings of     civilization in her distant dependencies we may turn with advantage     to New Caledonia.  With a view to attracting free settlers to that     penal colony, M. Feillet, the Governor, forcibly expropriated the     Kanaka cultivators from the best of their plantations, with a     derisory compensation, in spite of the protests of the Council     General of the island.  Such immigrants as could be induced to cross     the seas thus found themselves in possession of thousands of coffee,     cocoa, banana, and bread-fruit trees, the raising of which had cost     the wretched natives years of toil whilst the latter had a few     five-franc pieces to spend in the liquor stores of Noumea."
You observe the combination?  It is robbery, humiliation, and slow, slowmurder, through poverty and the white man's whisky.  The savage's gentlefriend, the savage's noble friend, the only magnanimous and unselfishfriend the savage has ever had, was not there with the merciful swiftrelease of his poisoned pudding.
There are many humorous things in the world; among them the white man'snotion that he is less savage than the other savages.--[See Chapter onTasmania, post.]
