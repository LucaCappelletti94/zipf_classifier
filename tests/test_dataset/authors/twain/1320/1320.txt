Observe, I do not mean to suggest that the _custom_ of lying hassuffered any decay or interruption--no, for the Lie, as a Virtue, A Principle,is eternal; the Lie, as a recreation, a solace, a refuge in time of need, thefourth Grace, the tenth Muse, man's best and surest friend, is immortal, andcannot perish from the earth while this club remains. My complaint simplyconcerns the decay of the _art_ of lying. No high-minded man, no man of rightfeeling, can contemplate the lumbering and slovenly lying of the present daywithout grieving to see a noble art so prostituted. In this veteran presence Inaturally enter upon this theme with diffidence; it is like an old maid tryingto teach nursery matters to the mothers in Israel. It would not become to meto criticise you, gentlemen--who are nearly all my elders--and my superiors,in this thing--if I should here and there _seem_ to do it, I trust it will inmost cases be more in a spirit of admiration than fault-finding; indeed ifthis finest of the fine arts had everywhere received the attention, theencouragement, and conscientious practice and development which this club hasdevoted to it, I should not need to utter this lament, or shred a single tear.I do not say this to flatter: I say it in a spirit of just and appreciativerecognition. [It had been my intention, at this point, to mention names andto give illustrative specimens, but indications observable about me admonishedme to beware of the particulars and confine myself to generalities.]No fact is more firmly established than that lying is a necessity of ourcircumstances--the deduction that it is then a Virtue goes without saying.No virtue can reach its highest usefulness without careful and diligentcultivation--therefore, it goes without saying that this one ought to betaught in the public schools--even in the newspapers. What chance has theignorant uncultivated liar against the educated expert? What chance have Iagainst Mr. Per--against a lawyer? _Judicious_ lying is what the world needs.I sometimes think it were even better and safer not to lie at all than to lieinjudiciously. An awkward, unscientific lie is often as ineffectual as thetruth.Now let us see what the philosophers say. Note that venerable proverb:Children and fools _always_ speak the truth. The deduction is plain--adultsand wise persons _never_speak it. Parkman, the historian, says, "The principleof truth may itself be carried into an absurdity." In another place in the samechapters he says, "The saying is old that truth should not be spoken at alltimes; and those whom a sick conscience worries into habitual violation ofthe maxim are imbeciles and nuisances." It is strong language, but true. Noneof us could _live_ with an habitual truth-teller; but thank goodness none ofus has to. An habitual truth-teller is simply an impossible creature; he doesnot exist; he never has existed. Of course there are people who _think_ theynever lie, but it is not so--and this ignorance is one of the very things thatshame our so-called civilization. Everybody lies--every day; every hour;awake; asleep; in his dreams; in his joy; in his mourning; if he keeps histongue still, his hands, his feet, his eyes, his attitude, will conveydeception--and purposely. Even in sermons--but that is a platitude.In a far country where I once lived the ladies used to go around payingcalls, under the humane and kindly pretence of wanting to see each other;and when they returned home, they would cry out with a glad voice, saying,"We made sixteen calls and found fourteen of them out"--not meaning thatthey found out anything important against the fourteen--no, that was onlya colloquial phrase to signify that they were not at home--and their mannerof saying it expressed their lively satisfaction in that fact. Now theirpretence of wanting to see the fourteen--and the other two whom they had beenless lucky with--was that commonest and mildest form of lying which issufficiently described as a deflection from the truth. Is it justifiable?Most certainly. It is beautiful, it is noble; for its object is, _not_ to reapprofit, but to convey a pleasure to the sixteen. The iron-souled truth-mongerwould plainly manifest, or even utter the fact that he didn't want to seethose people--and he would be an ass, and inflict totally unnecessary pain.And next, those ladies in that far country--but never mind, they had a thousandpleasant ways of lying, that grew out of gentle impulses, and were a creditto their intelligence and an honor to their hearts. Let the particulars go.The men in that far country were liars, every one. Their mere howdy-do was alie, because _they_ didn't care how you did, except they were undertakers. Tothe ordinary inquirer you lied in return; for you made no conscientiousdiagnostic of your case, but answered at random, and usually missed itconsiderably. You lied to the undertaker, and said your health was failing--awholly commendable lie, since it cost you nothing and pleased the other man.If a stranger called and interrupted you, you said with your hearty tongue,"I'm glad to see you," and said with your heartier soul, "I wish you were withthe cannibals and it was dinner-time." When he went, you said regretfully,"_Must_ you go?" and followed it with a "Call again;" but you did no harm, foryou did not deceive anybody nor inflict any hurt, whereas the truth would havemade you both unhappy.I think that all this courteous lying is a sweet and loving art, and shouldbe cultivated. The highest perfection of politeness is only a beautifuledifice, built, from the base to the dome, of graceful and gilded forms ofcharitable and unselfish lying.What I bemoan is the growing prevalence of the brutal truth. Let us do whatwe can to eradicate it. An injurious truth has no merit over an injurious lie.Neither should ever be uttered. The man who speaks an injurious truth lesthis soul be not saved if he do otherwise, should reflect that that sort of asoul is not strictly worth saving. The man who tells a lie to help a poordevil out of trouble, is one of whom the angels doubtless say, "Lo, here isan heroic soul who casts his own welfare in jeopardy to succor his neighbor's;let us exalt this magnanimous liar."An injurious lie is an uncommendable thing; and so, also, and in the samedegree, is an injurious truth--a fact that is recognized by the law of libel.Among other common lies, we have the _silent_ lie--the deception which oneconveys by simply keeping still and concealing the truth. Many obstinatetruth-mongers indulge in this dissipation, imagining that if they _speak_ nolie, they lie not at all. In that far country where I once lived, there wasa lovely spirit, a lady whose impulses were always high and pure, and whosecharacter answered to them. One day I was there at dinner, and remarked, ina general way, that we are all liars. She was amazed, and said, "Not _all_?"It was before "Pinafore's" time. so I did not make the response which wouldnaturally follow in our day, but frankly said, "Yes, _all_--we are all liars.There are no exceptions." She looked almost offended, "Why, do you include_me_?" "Certainly," I said. "I think you even rank as an expert." She said"Sh-'sh! the children!" So the subject was changed in deference to thechildren's presence, and we went on talking about other things. But as soonas the young people were out of the way, the lady came warmly back to thematter and said, "I have made a rule of my life to never tell a lie; and Ihave never departed from it in a single instance." I said, "I don't mean theleast harm or disrespect, but really you have been lying like smoke eversince I've been sitting here. It has caused me a good deal of pain, becauseI'm not used to it." She required of me an instance--just a single instance.So I said--"Well, here is the unfilled duplicate of the blank, which the Oaklandhospital people sent to you by the hand of the sick-nurse when she came hereto nurse your little nephew through his dangerous illness. This blank asksall manners of questions as to the conduct of that sick-nurse: 'Did she eversleep on her watch? Did she ever forget to give the medicine?' and so forthand so on. You are warned to be very careful and explicit in your answers, forthe welfare of the service requires that the nurses be promptly fined orotherwise punished for derelictions. You told me you were perfectly delightedwith this nurse--that she had a thousand perfections and only one fault: youfound you never could depend on her wrapping Johnny up half sufficiently whilehe waited in a chilly chair for her to rearrange the warm bed.You filled up the duplicate of this paper, and sent it back to the hospitalby the hand of the nurse. How did you answer this question--'Was the nurseat any time guilty of a negligence which was likely to result in the patient'staking cold?' Come--everything is decided by a bet here in California: tendollars to ten cents you lied when you answered that question." She said, "Ididn't; _I left it blank!_" "Just so--you have told a _silent_ lie; you haveleft it to be inferred that you had no fault to find in that matter." She said,"Oh, was that a lie? And _how_ could I mention her one single fault, and sheis so good?--It would have been cruel." I said, "One ought always to lie, whenone can do good by it; your impulse was right, but your judgment was crude;this comes of unintelligent practice. Now observe the results of this inexpertdeflection of yours. You know Mr. Jones's Willie is lying very low withscarlet-fever; well, your recommendation was so enthusiastic that that girlis there nursing him, and the worn-out family have all been trustingly soundasleep for the last fourteen hours, leaving their darling with full confidencein those fatal hands, because you, like young George Washington, have a reputa--However, if you are not going to have anything to do, I will come aroundto-morrow and we'll attend the funeral together, for, of course, you'llnaturally feel a peculiar interest in Willie's case--as personal a one, infact, as the undertaker."But that was not all lost. Before I was half-way through she was in a carriageand making thirty miles an hour toward the Jones mansion to save what was leftof Willie and tell all she knew about the deadly nurse. All of which wasunnecessary, as Willie wasn't sick; I had been lying myself. But that same day,all the same, she sent a line to the hospital which filled up the neglectedblank, and stated the _facts,_ too, in the squarest possible manner.Now, you see, this lady's fault was _not_ in lying, but in lyinginjudiciously. She should have told the truth, _there,_ and made it up to thenurse with a fraudulent compliment further along in the paper. She could havesaid, "In one respect this sick-nurse is perfection--when she is on the watch,she never snores." Almost any little pleasant lie would have taken the stingout of that troublesome but necessary expression of the truth.Lying is universal--we _all_ do it. Therefore, the wise thing is for usdiligently to train ourselves to lie thoughtfully, judiciously; to lie witha good object, and not an evil one; to lie for others' advantage, and not ourown; to lie healingly, charitably, humanely, not cruelly, hurtfully,maliciously; to lie gracefully and graciously, not awkwardly and clumsily;to lie firmly, frankly, squarely, with head erect, not haltingly, tortuously,with pusillanimous mien, as being ashamed of our high calling. Then shall webe rid of the rank and pestilent truth that is rotting the land; then shallwe be great and good and beautiful, and worthy dwellers in a world where evenbenign Nature habitually lies, except when she promises execrable weather.Then--But am I but a new and feeble student in this gracious art; I cannotinstruct _this_ club.Joking aside, I think there is much need of wise examination into what sortsof lies are best and wholesomest to be indulged, seeing we _must_ all lie andwe _do_ all lie, and what sorts it may be best to avoid--and this is a thingwhich I feel I can confidently put into the hands of this experienced Club--aripe body, who may be termed, in this regard, and without undue flattery, OldMasters.
