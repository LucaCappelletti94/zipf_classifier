SATAN (impatiently) to NEW-COMER. The trouble with you Chicago peopleis, that you think you are the best people down here; whereas you aremerely the most numerous. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
We wandered contentedly around here and there in India; to Lahore, amongother places, where the Lieutenant-Governor lent me an elephant. Thishospitality stands out in my experiences in a stately isolation. It wasa fine elephant, affable, gentlemanly, educated, and I was not afraid ofit. I even rode it with confidence through the crowded lanes of thenative city, where it scared all the horses out of their senses, andwhere children were always just escaping its feet. It took the middle ofthe road in a fine independent way, and left it to the world to get outof the way or take the consequences. I am used to being afraid ofcollisions when I ride or drive, but when one is on top of an elephantthat feeling is absent. I could have ridden in comfort through aregiment of runaway teams. I could easily learn to prefer an elephant toany other vehicle, partly because of that immunity from collisions, andpartly because of the fine view one has from up there, and partly becauseof the dignity one feels in that high place, and partly because one canlook in at the windows and see what is going on privately among thefamily. The Lahore horses were used to elephants, but they wererapturously afraid of them just the same. It seemed curious. Perhapsthe better they know the elephant the more they respect him in thatpeculiar way. In our own case--we are not afraid of dynamite till we getacquainted with it.
We drifted as far as Rawal Pindi, away up on the Afghan frontier--I thinkit was the Afghan frontier, but it may have been Hertzegovina--it wasaround there somewhere--and down again to Delhi, to see the ancientarchitectural wonders there and in Old Delhi and not describe them, andalso to see the scene of the illustrious assault, in the Mutiny days,when the British carried Delhi by storm, one of the marvels of historyfor impudent daring and immortal valor.
We had a refreshing rest, there in Delhi, in a great old mansion whichpossessed historical interest. It was built by a rich Englishman who hadbecome orientalized--so much so that he had a zenana. But he was abroadminded man, and remained so. To please his harem he built a mosque;to please himself he built an English church. That kind of a man willarrive, somewhere. In the Mutiny days the mansion was the Britishgeneral's headquarters. It stands in a great garden--oriental fashion--and about it are many noble trees. The trees harbor monkeys; and theyare monkeys of a watchful and enterprising sort, and not much troubledwith fear. They invade the house whenever they get a chance, and carryoff everything they don't want. One morning the master of the house wasin his bath, and the window was open. Near it stood a pot of yellowpaint and a brush. Some monkeys appeared in the window; to scare themaway, the gentleman threw his sponge at them. They did not scare at all;they jumped into the room and threw yellow paint all over him from thebrush, and drove him out; then they painted the walls and the floor andthe tank and the windows and the furniture yellow, and were in thedressing-room painting that when help arrived and routed them.
Two of these creatures came into my room in the early morning, through awindow whose shutters I had left open, and when I woke one of them wasbefore the glass brushing his hair, and the other one had my note-book,and was reading a page of humorous notes and crying. I did not mind theone with the hair-brush, but the conduct of the other one hurt me; ithurts me yet. I threw something at him, and that was wrong, for my hosthad told me that the monkeys were best left alone. They threw everythingat me that they could lift, and then went into the bathroom to get somemore things, and I shut the door on them.
At Jeypore, in Rajputana, we made a considerable stay. We were not inthe native city, but several miles from it, in the small Europeanofficial suburb. There were but few Europeans--only fourteen but theywere all kind and hospitable, and it amounted to being at home. InJeypore we found again what we had found all about India--that while theIndian servant is in his way a very real treasure, he will sometimes bearwatching, and the Englishman watches him. If he sends him on an errand,he wants more than the man's word for it that he did the errand. Whenfruit and vegetables were sent to us, a "chit" came with them--a receiptfor us to sign; otherwise the things might not arrive. If a gentlemansent up his carriage, the chit stated "from" such-and-such an hour "to"such-and-such an hour--which made it unhandy for the coachman and his twoor three subordinates to put us off with a part of the allotted time anddevote the rest of it to a lark of their own.
We were pleasantly situated in a small two-storied inn, in an empty largecompound which was surrounded by a mud wall as high as a man's head. Theinn was kept by nine Hindoo brothers, its owners. They lived, with theirfamilies, in a one-storied building within the compound, but off to oneside, and there was always a long pile of their little comely brownchildren loosely stacked in its veranda, and a detachment of the parentswedged among them, smoking the hookah or the howdah, or whatever theycall it. By the veranda stood a palm, and a monkey lived in it, and leda lonesome life, and always looked sad and weary, and the crows botheredhim a good deal.
The inn cow poked about the compound and emphasized the secluded andcountry air of the place, and there was a dog of no particular breed, whowas always present in the compound, and always asleep, always stretchedout baking in the sun and adding to the deep tranquility andreposefulness of the place, when the crows were away on business.White-draperied servants were coming and going all the time, but theyseemed only spirits, for their feet were bare and made no sound. Downthe lane a piece lived an elephant in the shade of a noble tree, androcked and rocked, and reached about with his trunk, begging of his brownmistress or fumbling the children playing at his feet. And there werecamels about, but they go on velvet feet, and were proper to the silenceand serenity of the surroundings.
The Satan mentioned at the head of this chapter was not our Satan, butthe other one. Our Satan was lost to us. In these later days he hadpassed out of our life--lamented by me, and sincerely. I was missinghim; I am missing him yet, after all these months. He was an astonishingcreature to fly around and do things. He didn't always do them quiteright, but he did them, and did them suddenly. There was no time wasted.You would say:
"Pack the trunks and bags, Satan."
"Wair good" (very good).
Then there would be a brief sound of thrashing and slashing and hummingand buzzing, and a spectacle as of a whirlwind spinning gowns and jacketsand coats and boots and things through the air, and then with bow andtouch--
"Awready, master."
It was wonderful. It made one dizzy. He crumpled dresses a good deal,and he had no particular plan about the work--at first--except to puteach article into the trunk it didn't belong in. But he soon reformed,in this matter. Not entirely; for, to the last, he would cram into thesatchel sacred to literature any odds and ends of rubbish that hecouldn't find a handy place for elsewhere. When threatened with deathfor this, it did not trouble him; he only looked pleasant, saluted withsoldierly grace, said "Wair good," and did it again next day.
He was always busy; kept the rooms tidied up, the boots polished, theclothes brushed, the wash-basin full of clean water, my dress clotheslaid out and ready for the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time; and hedressed me from head to heel in spite of my determination to do itmyself, according to my lifelong custom.
He was a born boss, and loved to command, and to jaw and dispute withinferiors and harry them and bullyrag them. He was fine at the railwaystation--yes, he was at his finest there. He would shoulder and plungeand paw his violent way through the packed multitude of natives withnineteen coolies at his tail, each bearing a trifle of luggage--one atrunk, another a parasol, another a shawl, another a fan, and so on; onearticle to each, and the longer the procession, the better he was suited--and he was sure to make for some engaged sleeper and begin to hurl theowner's things out of it, swearing that it was ours and that there hadbeen a mistake. Arrived at our own sleeper, he would undo thebedding-bundles and make the beds and put everything to rights andshipshape in two minutes; then put his head out at, a window and have arestful good time abusing his gang of coolies and disputing their billuntil we arrived and made him pay them and stop his noise.
Speaking of noise, he certainly was the noisest little devil in India--and that is saying much, very much, indeed. I loved him for his noise,but the family detested him for it. They could not abide it; they couldnot get reconciled to it. It humiliated them. As a rule, when we gotwithin six hundred yards of one of those big railway stations, a mightyracket of screaming and shrieking and shouting and storming would breakupon us, and I would be happy to myself, and the family would say, withshame:
"There--that's Satan. Why do you keep him?"
And, sure enough, there in the whirling midst of fifteen hundredwondering people we would find that little scrap of a creaturegesticulating like a spider with the colic, his black eyes snapping, hisfez-tassel dancing, his jaws pouring out floods of billingsgate upon hisgang of beseeching and astonished coolies.
I loved him; I couldn't help it; but the family--why, they could hardlyspeak of him with patience. To this day I regret his loss, and wish Ihad him back; but they--it is different with them. He was a native, andcame from Surat. Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his birthplaceand Manuel's, and fifteen hundred between their ways and characters anddispositions. I only liked Manuel, but I loved Satan. This latter'sreal name was intensely Indian. I could not quite get the hang of it,but it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder. It was too longfor handy use, anyway; so I reduced it.
When he had been with us two or three weeks, he began to make mistakeswhich I had difficulty in patching up for him. Approaching Benares oneday, he got out of the train to see if he could get up a misunderstandingwith somebody, for it had been a weary, long journey and he wanted tofreshen up. He found what he was after, but kept up his pow-wow a shadetoo long and got left. So there we were in a strange city and nochambermaid. It was awkward for us, and we told him he must not do soany more. He saluted and said in his dear, pleasant way, "Wair good."Then at Lucknow he got drunk. I said it was a fever, and got thefamily's compassion, and solicitude aroused; so they gave him ateaspoonful of liquid quinine and it set his vitals on fire. He madeseveral grimaces which gave me a better idea of the Lisbon earthquakethan any I have ever got of it from paintings and descriptions. Hisdrunk was still portentously solid next morning, but I could have pulledhim through with the family if he would only have taken another spoonfulof that remedy; but no, although he was stupefied, his memory still hadflickerings of life; so he smiled a divinely dull smile and said,fumblingly saluting:
"Scoose me, mem Saheb, scoose me, Missy Saheb; Satan not prefer it,please."
Then some instinct revealed to them that he was drunk. They gave himprompt notice that next time this happened he must go. He got out amaudlin and most gentle "Wair good," and saluted indefinitely.
Only one short week later he fell again. And oh, sorrow! not in a hotelthis time, but in an English gentleman's private house. And in Agra, ofall places. So he had to go. When I told him, he said patiently, "Wairgood," and made his parting salute, and went out from us to return nomore forever. Dear me! I would rather have lost a hundred angels thanthat one poor lovely devil. What style he used to put on, in a swellhotel or in a private house--snow-white muslin from his chin to his barefeet, a crimson sash embroidered with gold thread around his waist, andon his head a great sea-green turban like to the turban of the GrandTurk.
He was not a liar; but he will become one if he keeps on. He told meonce that he used to crack cocoanuts with his teeth when he was a boy;and when I asked how he got them into his mouth, he said he was upward ofsix feet high at that time, and had an unusual mouth. And when Ifollowed him up and asked him what had become of that other foot, he saida house fell on him and he was never able to get his stature back again.Swervings like these from the strict line of fact often beguile atruthful man on and on until he eventually becomes a liar.
His successor was a Mohammedan, Sahadat Mohammed Khan; very dark, verytall, very grave. He went always in flowing masses of white, from thetop of his big turban down to his bare feet. His voice was low. Heglided about in a noiseless way, and looked like a ghost. He wascompetent and satisfactory. But where he was, it seemed always Sunday.It was not so in Satan's time.
Jeypore is intensely Indian, but it has two or three features whichindicate the presence of European science and European interest in theweal of the common public, such as the liberal water-supply furnished bygreat works built at the State's expense; good sanitation, resulting in adegree of healthfulness unusually high for India; a noble pleasuregarden, with privileged days for women; schools for the instruction ofnative youth in advanced art, both ornamental and utilitarian; and a newand beautiful palace stocked with a museum of extraordinary interest andvalue. Without the Maharaja's sympathy and purse these beneficencescould not have been created; but he is a man of wide views and largegenerosities, and all such matters find hospitality with him.
We drove often to the city from the hotel Kaiser-i-Hind, a journey whichwas always full of interest, both night and day, for that country roadwas never quiet, never empty, but was always India in motion, always astreaming flood of brown people clothed in smouchings from the rainbow, atossing and moiling flood, happy, noisy, a charming and satisfyingconfusion of strange human and strange animal life and equally strangeand outlandish vehicles.
And the city itself is a curiosity. Any Indian city is that, but thisone is not like any other that we saw. It is shut up in a lofty turretedwall; the main body of it is divided into six parts by perfectly straightstreets that are more than a hundred feet wide; the blocks of housesexhibit a long frontage of the most taking architectural quaintnesses,the straight lines being broken everywhere by pretty little balconies,pillared and highly ornamented, and other cunning and cozy and invitingperches and projections, and many of the fronts are curiously pictured bythe brush, and the whole of them have the soft rich tint of strawberryice-cream. One cannot look down the far stretch of the chief street andpersuade himself that these are real houses, and that it is all out ofdoors--the impression that it is an unreality, a picture, a scene in atheater, is the only one that will take hold.
Then there came a great day when this illusion was more pronounced thanever. A rich Hindoo had been spending a fortune upon the manufacture ofa crowd of idols and accompanying paraphernalia whose purpose was toillustrate scenes in the life of his especial god or saint, and this fineshow was to be brought through the town in processional state at ten inthe morning. As we passed through the great public pleasure garden onour way to the city we found it crowded with natives. That was onesight. Then there was another. In the midst of the spacious lawnsstands the palace which contains the museum--a beautiful construction ofstone which shows arched colonnades, one above another, and receding,terrace-fashion, toward the sky. Every one of these terraces, all theway to the top one, was packed and jammed with natives. One must try toimagine those solid masses of splendid color, one above another, up andup, against the blue sky, and the Indian sun turning them all to beds offire and flame.
Later, when we reached the city, and glanced down the chief avenue,smouldering in its crushed-strawberry tint, those splendid effects wererepeated; for every balcony, and every fanciful bird-cage of a snuggerycountersunk in the house-fronts, and all the long lines of roofs werecrowded with people, and each crowd was an explosion of brilliant color.
Then the wide street itself, away down and down and down into thedistance, was alive with gorgeously-clothed people not still, but moving,swaying, drifting, eddying, a delirious display of all colors and allshades of color, delicate, lovely, pale, soft, strong, stunning, vivid,brilliant, a sort of storm of sweetpea blossoms passing on the wings of ahurricane; and presently, through this storm of color, came swaying andswinging the majestic elephants, clothed in their Sunday best ofgaudinesses, and the long procession of fanciful trucks freighted withtheir groups of curious and costly images, and then the long rearguard ofstately camels, with their picturesque riders.
For color, and picturesqueness, and novelty, and outlandishness, andsustained interest and fascination, it was the most satisfying show I hadever seen, and I suppose I shall not have the privilege of looking uponits like again.
