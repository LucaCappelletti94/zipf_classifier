Checked by the Folly of the Wise
WE MARCHED out in great strength and splendor, and took the road towardOrleans. The initial part of Joan's great dream was realizing itself atlast. It was the first time that any of us youngsters had ever seen anarmy, and it was a most stately and imposing spectacle to us. It wasindeed an inspiring sight, that interminable column, stretching away intothe fading distances, and curving itself in and out of the crookedness ofthe road like a mighty serpent. Joan rode at the head of it with herpersonal staff; then came a body of priests singing the Veni Creator, thebanner of the Cross rising out of their midst; after these the glintingforest of spears. The several divisions were commanded by the greatArmagnac generals, La Hire, and Marshal de Boussac, the Sire de Retz,Florent d'Illiers, and Poton de Saintrailles.
Each in his degree was tough, and there were three degrees--tough,tougher, toughest--and La Hire was the last by a shade, but only a shade.They were just illustrious official brigands, the whole party; and bylong habits of lawlessness they had lost all acquaintanceship withobedience, if they had ever had any.
But what was the good of saying that? These independent birds knew nolaw. They seldom obeyed the King; they never obeyed him when it didn'tsuit them to do it. Would they obey the Maid? In the first place theywouldn't know how to obey her or anybody else, and in the second place itwas of course not possible for them to take her military characterseriously--that country-girl of seventeen who had been trained for thecomplex and terrible business of war--how? By tending sheep.
They had no idea of obeying her except in cases where their veteranmilitary knowledge and experience showed them that the thing she requiredwas sound and right when gauged by the regular military standards. Werethey to blame for this attitude? I should think not. Old war-worncaptains are hard-headed, practical men. They do not easily believe inthe ability of ignorant children to plan campaigns and command armies. Nogeneral that ever lived could have taken Joan seriously (militarily)before she raised the siege of Orleans and followed it with the greatcampaign of the Loire.
Did they consider Joan valueless? Far from it. They valued her as thefruitful earth values the sun--they fully believed she could produce thecrop, but that it was in their line of business, not hers, to take itoff. They had a deep and superstitious reverence for her as being endowedwith a mysterious supernatural something that was able to do a mightything which they were powerless to do--blow the breath of life and valorinto the dead corpses of cowed armies and turn them into heroes.
To their minds they were everything with her, but nothing without her.She could inspire the soldiers and fit them for battle--but fight thebattle herself? Oh, nonsense--that was their function. They, thegenerals, would fight the battles, Joan would give the victory. That wastheir idea--an unconscious paraphrase of Joan's reply to the Dominican.
So they began by playing a deception upon her. She had a clear idea ofhow she meant to proceed. It was her purpose to march boldly upon Orleansby the north bank of the Loire. She gave that order to her generals. Theysaid to themselves, "The idea is insane--it is blunder No. 1; it is whatmight have been expected of this child who is ignorant of war." Theyprivately sent the word to the Bastard of Orleans. He also recognized theinsanity of it--at least he though he did--and privately advised thegenerals to get around the order in some way.
They did it by deceiving Joan. She trusted those people, she was notexpecting this sort of treatment, and was not on the lookout for it. Itwas a lesson to her; she saw to it that the game was not played a secondtime.
Why was Joan's idea insane, from the generals' point of view, but notfrom hers? Because her plan was to raise the siege immediately, byfighting, while theirs was to besiege the besiegers and starve them outby closing their communications--a plan which would require months in theconsummation.
The English had built a fence of strong fortresses called bastillesaround Orleans--fortresses which closed all the gates of the city butone. To the French generals the idea of trying to fight their way pastthose fortresses and lead the army into Orleans was preposterous; theybelieved that the result would be the army's destruction. One may notdoubt that their opinion was militarily sound--no, would have been, butfor one circumstance which they overlooked. That was this: the Englishsoldiers were in a demoralized condition of superstitious terror; theyhad become satisfied that the Maid was in league with Satan. By reason ofthis a good deal of their courage had oozed out and vanished. On theother hand, the Maid'' soldiers were full of courage, enthusiasm, andzeal.
Joan could have marched by the English forts. However, it was not to be.She had been cheated out of her first chance to strike a heavy blow forher country.
In camp that night she slept in her armor on the ground. It was a coldnight, and she was nearly as stiff as her armor itself when we resumedthe march in the morning, for iron is not good material for a blanket.However, her joy in being now so far on her way to the theater of hermission was fire enough to warm her, and it soon did it.
Her enthusiasm and impatience rose higher and higher with every mile ofprogress; but at last we reached Olivet, and down it went, andindignation took its place. For she saw the trick that had been playedupon her--the river lay between us and Orleans.
She was for attacking one of the three bastilles that were on our side ofthe river and forcing access to the bridge which it guarded (a projectwhich, if successful, would raise the siege instantly), but thelong-ingrained fear of the English came upon her generals and theyimplored her not to make the attempt. The soldiers wanted to attack, buthad to suffer disappointment. So we moved on and came to a halt at apoint opposite Checy, six miles above Orleans.
Dunois, Bastard of Orleans, with a body of knights and citizens, came upfrom the city to welcome Joan. Joan was still burning with resentmentover the trick that had been put upon her, and was not in the mood forsoft speeches, even to reversed military idols of her childhood. Shesaid:
"Are you the bastard?"
"Yes, I am he, and am right glad of your coming."
"And did you advise that I be brought by this side of the river insteadof straight to Talbot and the English?"
Her high manner abashed him, and he was not able to answer with anythinglike a confident promptness, but with many hesitations and partialexcuses he managed to get out the confession that for what he and thecouncil had regarded as imperative military reasons they so advised.
"In God's name," said Joan, "my Lord's counsel is safer and wiser thanyours. You thought to deceive me, but you have deceived yourselves, for Ibring you the best help that ever knight or city had; for it is God'shelp, not sent for love of me, but by God's pleasure. At the prayer ofSt. Louis and St. Charlemagne He has had pity on Orleans, and will notsuffer the enemy to have both the Duke of Orleans and his city. Theprovisions to save the starving people are here, the boats are below thecity, the wind is contrary, they cannot come up hither. Now then, tellme, in God's name, you who are so wise, what that council of yours wasthinking about, to invent this foolish difficulty."
Dunois and the rest fumbled around the matter a moment, then gave in andconceded that a blunder had been made.
"Yes, a blunder has been made," said Joan, "and except God take yourproper work upon Himself and change the wind and correct your blunder foryou, there is none else that can devise a remedy."
Some of these people began to perceive that with all her technicalignorance she had practical good sense, and that with all her nativesweetness and charm she was not the right kind of a person to play with.
Presently God did take the blunder in hand, and by His grace the wind didchange. So the fleet of boats came up and went away loaded withprovisions and cattle, and conveyed that welcome succor to the hungrycity, managing the matter successfully under protection of a sortie fromthe walls against the bastille of St. Loup. Then Joan began on theBastard again:
"You see here the army?"
"Yes."
"It is here on this side by advice of your council?"
"Yes."
"Now, in God's name, can that wise council explain why it is better tohave it here than it would be to have it in the bottom of the sea?"
Dunois made some wandering attempts to explain the inexplicable andexcuse the inexcusable, but Joan cut him short and said:
"Answer me this, good sir--has the army any value on this side of theriver?"
The Bastard confessed that it hadn't--that is, in view of the plan ofcampaign which she had devised and decreed.
"And yet, knowing this, you had the hardihood to disobey my orders. Sincethe army's place is on the other side, will you explain to me how it isto get there?"
The whole size of the needless muddle was apparent. Evasions were of nouse; therefore Dunois admitted that there was no way to correct theblunder but to send the army all the way back to Blois, and let it beginover again and come up on the other side this time, according to Joan'soriginal plan.
Any other girl, after winning such a triumph as this over a veteransoldier of old renown, might have exulted a little and been excusable forit, but Joan showed no disposition of this sort. She dropped a word ortwo of grief over the precious time that must be lost, then began at onceto issue commands for the march back. She sorrowed to see her army go;for she said its heart was great and its enthusiasm high, and that withit at her back she did not fear to face all the might of England.
All arrangements having been completed for the return of the main body ofthe army, she took the Bastard and La Hire and a thousand men and wentdown to Orleans, where all the town was in a fever of impatience to havesight of her face. It was eight in the evening when she and the troopsrode in at the Burgundy gate, with the Paladin preceding her with herstandard. She was riding a white horse, and she carried in her hand thesacred sword of Fierbois. You should have seen Orleans then. What apicture it was! Such black seas of people, such a starry firmament oftorches, such roaring whirlwinds of welcome, such booming of bells andthundering of cannon! It was as if the world was come to an end.Everywhere in the glare of the torches one saw rank upon rank of upturnedwhite faces, the mouths wide open, shouting, and the unchecked tearsrunning down; Joan forged her slow way through the solid masses, hermailed form projecting above the pavement of heads like a silver statue.The people about her struggled along, gazing up at her through theirtears with the rapt look of men and women who believe they are seeing onewho is divine; and always her feet were being kissed by grateful folk,and such as failed of that privilege touched her horse and then kissedtheir fingers.
Nothing that Joan did escaped notice; everything she did was commentedupon and applauded. You could hear the remarks going all the time.
"There--she's smiling--see!"
"Now she's taking her little plumed cap off to somebody--ah, it's fineand graceful!"
"She's patting that woman on the head with her gauntlet."
"Oh, she was born on a horse--see her turn in her saddle, and kiss thehilt of her sword to the ladies in the window that threw the flowersdown."
"Now there's a poor woman lifting up a child--she's kissed it--oh, she'sdivine!"
"What a dainty little figure it is, and what a lovely face--and suchcolor and animation!"
Joan's slender long banner streaming backward had an accident--the fringecaught fire from a torch. She leaned forward and crushed the flame in herhand.
"She's not afraid of fire nor anything!" they shouted, and delivered astorm of admiring applause that made everything quake.
She rode to the cathedral and gave thanks to God, and the people crammedthe place and added their devotions to hers; then she took up her marchagain and picked her slow way through the crowds and the wilderness oftorches to the house of Jacques Boucher, treasurer of the Duke ofOrleans, where she was to be the guest of his wife as long as she stayedin the city, and have his young daughter for comrade and room-mate. Thedelirium of the people went on the rest of the night, and with it theclamor of the joy-bells and the welcoming cannon.
Joan of Arc had stepped upon her stage at last, and was ready to begin.
