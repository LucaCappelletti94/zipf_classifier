"Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look atGilford Dudley; look at old Northumberland! Why,Huck, s'pose it IS considerble trouble? -- what yougoing to do? -- how you going to get around it?Jim's GOT to do his inscription and coat of arms. Theyall do."
Jim says:
"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; Ihain't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt, en you knowsI got to keep de journal on dat."
"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms isvery different."
"Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when hesays he ain't got no coat of arms, because he hain't."
"I reckon I knowed that," Tom says, "but youbet he'll have one before he goes out of this -- becausehe's going out RIGHT, and there ain't going to be noflaws in his record."
So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on abrickbat apiece, Jim a-making his'n out of the brassand I making mine out of the spoon, Tom set to workto think out the coat of arms. By and by he said he'dstruck so many good ones he didn't hardly knowwhich to take, but there was one which he reckonedhe'd decide on. He says:
"On the scutcheon we'll have a bend OR in thedexter base, a saltire MURREY in the fess, with a dog,couchant, for common charge, and under his foot achain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron VERT in achief engrailed, and three invected lines on a fieldAZURE, with the nombril points rampant on a dancetteindented; crest, a runaway nigger, SABLE, with hisbundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and acouple of gules for supporters, which is you and me;motto, MAGGIORE FRETTA, MINORE OTTO. Got it out of abook -- means the more haste the less speed."
"Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest ofit mean?"
"We ain't got no time to bother over that," hesays; "we got to dig in like all git-out."
"Well, anyway," I says, "what's SOME of it?What's a fess?"
"A fess -- a fess is -- YOU don't need to know whata fess is. I'll show him how to make it when he getsto it."
"Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell aperson. What's a bar sinister?"
"Oh, I don't know. But he's got to have it. Allthe nobility does."
That was just his way. If it didn't suit him to ex-plain a thing to you, he wouldn't do it. You mightpump at him a week, it wouldn't make no difference.
He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, sonow he started in to finish up the rest of that part ofthe work, which was to plan out a mournful inscrip-tion -- said Jim got to have one, like they all done.He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, andread them off, so:
   1. Here a captive heart busted.   2. Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the world      and friends, fretted his sorrowful life.   3. Here a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit      went to its rest, after thirty-seven years      of solitary captivity.   4. Here, homeless and friendless, after      thirty-seven years of bitter captivity,      perished a noble stranger, natural son of       Louis XIV.
Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them,and he most broke down. When he got done hecouldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jimto scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; butat last he allowed he would let him scrabble them allon. Jim said it would take him a year to scrabblesuch a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and hedidn't know how to make letters, besides; but Tomsaid he would block them out for him, and then hewouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the lines.Then pretty soon he says:
"Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; theydon't have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig theinscriptions into a rock. We'll fetch a rock."
Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he saidit would take him such a pison long time to dig theminto a rock he wouldn't ever get out. But Tom saidhe would let me help him do it. Then he took a lookto see how me and Jim was getting along with thepens. It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow,and didn't give my hands no show to get well of thesores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly;so Tom says:
"I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock forthe coat of arms and mournful inscriptions, and we cankill two birds with that same rock. There's a gaudybig grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it,and carve the things on it, and file out the pens andthe saw on it, too."
It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't noslouch of a grindstone nuther; but we allowed we'dtackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet, so we clearedout for the mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouchedthe grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but itwas a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what wecould, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and shecome mighty near mashing us every time. Tom saidshe was going to get one of us, sure, before we gotthrough. We got her half way; and then we wasplumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch JimSo he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of thebed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, andwe crawled out through our hole and down there, andJim and me laid into that grindstone and walkedher along like nothing; and Tom superintended.He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. Heknowed how to do everything.
Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough toget the grindstone through; but Jim he took the pickand soon made it big enough. Then Tom marked outthem things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work onthem, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt fromthe rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer, and told himto work till the rest of his candle quit on him, and thenhe could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under hisstraw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fixhis chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bedourselves. But Tom thought of something, and says:
"You got any spiders in here, Jim?"
"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."
"All right, we'll get you some."
"But bless you, honey, I doan' WANT none. I'safeard un um. I jis' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."
Tom thought a minute or two, and says:
"It's a good idea. And I reckon it's been done.It MUST a been done; it stands to reason. Yes, it's aprime good idea. Where could you keep it?"
"Keep what, Mars Tom?"
"Why, a rattlesnake."
"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, ifdey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I'd take en bustright out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid my head."
Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after alittle. You could tame it."
"TAME it!"
"Yes -- easy enough. Every animal is grateful forkindness and petting, and they wouldn't THINK of hurt-ing a person that pets them. Any book will tell youthat. You try -- that's all I ask; just try for two orthree days. Why, you can get him so in a little whilethat he'll love you; and sleep with you; and won'tstay away from you a minute; and will let you wraphim round your neck and put his head in your mouth."
"PLEASE, Mars Tom -- DOAN' talk so! I can't STAN'it! He'd LET me shove his head in my mouf -- fer afavor, hain't it? I lay he'd wait a pow'ful long time'fo' I AST him. En mo' en dat, I doan' WANT him tosleep wid me."
"Jim, don't act so foolish. A prisoner's GOT tohave some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnakehain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory to begained in your being the first to ever try it than anyother way you could ever think of to save your life."
"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no sich glory.Snake take 'n bite Jim's chin off, den WHAH is deglory? No, sah, I doan' want no sich doin's."
"Blame it, can't you TRY? I only WANT you to try-- you needn't keep it up if it don't work."
"But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me whileI's a tryin' him. Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos'anything 'at ain't onreasonable, but ef you en Huckfetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I'sgwyne to LEAVE, dat's SHORE."
"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it. We can get you some garter-snakes,and you can tie some buttons on their tails, and let onthey're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have to do."
"I k'n stan' DEM, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f Icouldn' get along widout um, I tell you dat. I neverknowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble to bea prisoner."
"Well, it ALWAYS is when it's done right. You gotany rats around here?"
"No, sah, I hain't seed none."
"Well, we'll get you some rats."
"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no rats. Dey'sde dadblamedest creturs to 'sturb a body, en rustleroun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's tryin' tosleep, I ever see. No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'fI's got to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain'got no use f'r um, skasely."
"But, Jim, you GOT to have 'em -- they all do. Sodon't make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain'tever without rats. There ain't no instance of it. Andthey train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks,and they get to be as sociable as flies. But you got toplay music to them. You got anything to play musicon?"
"I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o'paper, en a juice-harp; but I reck'n dey wouldn' takeno stock in a juice-harp."
"Yes they would. THEY don't care what kind ofmusic 'tis. A jews-harp's plenty good enough for arat. All animals like music -- in a prison they doteon it. Specially, painful music; and you can't get noother kind out of a jews-harp. It always intereststhem; they come out to see what's the matter withyou. Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very well.You want to set on your bed nights before you go tosleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link is Broken' -- that's thething that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else; andwhen you've played about two minutes you'll see allthe rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things beginto feel worried about you, and come. And they'lljust fairly swarm over you, and have a noble goodtime."
"Yes, DEY will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kineer time is JIM havin'? Blest if I kin see de pint. ButI'll do it ef I got to. I reck'n I better keep de animalssatisfied, en not have no trouble in de house."
Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn'tnothing else; and pretty soon he says:
"Oh, there's one thing I forgot. Could you raisea flower here, do you reckon?"
"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; butit's tolable dark in heah, en I ain' got no use f'r noflower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight o' trouble."
"Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisonershas done it."
"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks wouldgrow in heah, Mars Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn'tbe wuth half de trouble she'd coss."
"Don't you believe it. We'll fetch you a little oneand you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it.And don't call it mullen, call it Pitchiola -- that's itsright name when it's in a prison. And you want towater it with your tears."
"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom."
"You don't WANT spring water; you want to waterit with your tears. It's the way they always do."
"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er demmullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles anotherman's a START'N one wid tears."
"That ain't the idea. You GOT to do it with tears."
"She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholywill; kase I doan' skasely ever cry."
So Tom was stumped. But he studied it over, andthen said Jim would have to worry along the best hecould with an onion. He promised he would go to thenigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would "jis' 's soonhave tobacker in his coffee;" and found so much faultwith it, and with the work and bother of raising themullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting andflattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on topof all the other work he had to do on pens, and in-scriptions, and journals, and things, which made itmore trouble and worry and responsibility to be aprisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tommost lost all patience with him; and said he was justloadened down with more gaudier chances than aprisoner ever had in the world to make a name forhimself, and yet he didn't know enough to appreciatethem, and they was just about wasted on him. SoJim he was sorry, and said he wouldn't behave so nomore, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.
