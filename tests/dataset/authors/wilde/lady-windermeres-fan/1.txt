[LADY WINDERMERE is at table R., arranging roses in a blue bowl.]
[Enter PARKER.]
PARKER. Is your ladyship at home this afternoon?
LADY WINDERMERE. Yes--who has called?
PARKER. Lord Darlington, my lady.
LADY WINDERMERE. [Hesitates for a moment.] Show him up--and I'mat home to any one who calls.
PARKER. Yes, my lady.
[Exit C.]
LADY WINDERMERE. It's best for me to see him before to-night. I'mglad he's come.
[Enter PARKER C.]
PARKER. Lord Darlington,
[Enter LORD DARLINGTON C.]
[Exit PARKER.]
LORD DARLINGTON. How do you do, Lady Windermere?
LADY WINDERMERE. How do you do, Lord Darlington? No, I can'tshake hands with you. My hands are all wet with these roses.Aren't they lovely? They came up from Selby this morning.
LORD DARLINGTON. They are quite perfect. [Sees a fan lying on thetable.] And what a wonderful fan! May I look at it?
LADY WINDERMERE. Do. Pretty, isn't it! It's got my name on it,and everything. I have only just seen it myself. It's myhusband's birthday present to me. You know to-day is my birthday?
LORD DARLINGTON. No? Is it really?
LADY WINDERMERE. Yes, I'm of age to-day. Quite an important dayin my life, isn't it? That is why I am giving this party to-night.Do sit down. [Still arranging flowers.]
LORD DARLINGTON. [Sitting down.] I wish I had known it was yourbirthday, Lady Windermere. I would have covered the whole streetin front of your house with flowers for you to walk on. They aremade for you. [A short pause.]
LADY WINDERMERE. Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at theForeign Office. I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.
LORD DARLINGTON. I, Lady Windermere?
[Enter PARKER and FOOTMAN C., with tray and tea things.]
LADY WINDERMERE. Put it there, Parker. That will do. [Wipes herhands with her pocket-handkerchief, goes to tea-table, and sitsdown.] Won't you come over, Lord Darlington?
[Exit PARKER C.]
LORD DARLINGTON. [Takes chair and goes across L.C.] I am quitemiserable, Lady Windermere. You must tell me what I did. [Sitsdown at table L.]
LADY WINDERMERE. Well, you kept paying me elaborate complimentsthe whole evening.
LORD DARLINGTON. [Smiling.] Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hardup, that the only pleasant things to pay ARE compliments. They'rethe only things we CAN pay.
LADY WINDERMERE. [Shaking her head.] No, I am talking veryseriously. You mustn't laugh, I am quite serious. I don't likecompliments, and I don't see why a man should think he is pleasinga woman enormously when he says to her a whole heap of things thathe doesn't mean.
LORD DARLINGTON. Ah, but I did mean them. [Takes tea which sheoffers him.]
LADY WINDERMERE. [Gravely.] I hope not. I should be sorry tohave to quarrel with you, Lord Darlington. I like you very much,you know that. But I shouldn't like you at all if I thought youwere what most other men are. Believe me, you are better than mostother men, and I sometimes think you pretend to be worse.
LORD DARLINGTON. We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.
LADY WINDERMERE. Why do you make that your special one? [Stillseated at table L.]
LORD DARLINGTON. [Still seated L.C.] Oh, nowadays so manyconceited people go about Society pretending to be good, that Ithink it shows rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend tobe bad. Besides, there is this to be said. If you pretend to begood, the world takes you very seriously. If you pretend to bebad, it doesn't. Such is the astounding stupidity of optimism.
LADY WINDERMERE. Don't you WANT the world to take you seriouslythen, Lord Darlington?
LORD DARLINGTON. No, not the world. Who are the people the worldtakes seriously? All the dull people one can think of, from theBishops down to the bores. I should like YOU to take me veryseriously, Lady Windermere, YOU more than any one else in life.
LADY WINDERMERE. Why--why me?
LORD DARLINGTON. [After a slight hesitation.] Because I think wemight be great friends. Let us be great friends. You may want afriend some day.
LADY WINDERMERE. Why do you say that?
LORD DARLINGTON. Oh!--we all want friends at times.
LADY WINDERMERE. I think we're very good friends already, LordDarlington. We can always remain so as long as you don't -
LORD DARLINGTON. Don't what?
LADY WINDERMERE. Don't spoil it by saying extravagant silly thingsto me. You think I am a Puritan, I suppose? Well, I havesomething of the Puritan in me. I was brought up like that. I amglad of it. My mother died when I was a mere child. I livedalways with Lady Julia, my father's elder sister, you know. Shewas stern to me, but she taught me what the world is forgetting,the difference that there is between what is right and what iswrong. SHE allowed of no compromise. _I_ allow of none.
LORD DARLINGTON. My dear Lady Windermere!
LADY WINDERMERE. [Leaning back on the sofa.] You look on me asbeing behind the age.--Well, I am! I should be sorry to be on thesame level as an age like this.
LORD DARLINGTON. You think the age very bad?
LADY WINDERMERE. Yes. Nowadays people seem to look on life as aspeculation. It is not a speculation. It is a sacrament. Itsideal is Love. Its purification is sacrifice.
LORD DARLINGTON. [Smiling.] Oh, anything is better than beingsacrificed!
LADY WINDERMERE. [Leaning forward.] Don't say that.
LORD DARLINGTON. I do say it. I feel it--I know it.
[Enter PARKER C.]
PARKER. The men want to know if they are to put the carpets on theterrace for to-night, my lady?
LADY WINDERMERE. You don't think it will rain, Lord Darlington, doyou?
LORD DARLINGTON. I won't hear of its raining on your birthday!
LADY WINDERMERE. Tell them to do it at once, Parker.
[Exit PARKER C.]
LORD DARLINGTON. [Still seated.] Do you think then--of course Iam only putting an imaginary instance--do you think that in thecase of a young married couple, say about two years married, if thehusband suddenly becomes the intimate friend of a woman of--well,more than doubtful character--is always calling upon her, lunchingwith her, and probably paying her bills--do you think that the wifeshould not console herself?
LADY WINDERMERE. [Frowning] Console herself?
LORD DARLINGTON. Yes, I think she should--I think she has theright.
LADY WINDERMERE. Because the husband is vile--should the wife bevile also?
LORD DARLINGTON. Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere.
LADY WINDERMERE. It is a terrible thing, Lord Darlington.
LORD DARLINGTON. Do you know I am afraid that good people do agreat deal of harm in this world. Certainly the greatest harm theydo is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance. Itis absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are eithercharming or tedious. I take the side of the charming, and you,Lady Windermere, can't help belonging to them.
LADY WINDERMERE. Now, Lord Darlington. [Rising and crossing R.,front of him.] Don't stir, I am merely going to finish my flowers.[Goes to table R.C.]
LORD DARLINGTON. [Rising and moving chair.] And I must say Ithink you are very hard on modern life, Lady Windermere. Of coursethere is much against it, I admit. Most women, for instance,nowadays, are rather mercenary.
LADY WINDERMERE. Don't talk about such people.
LORD DARLINGTON. Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who,of course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women who havecommitted what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?
LADY WINDERMERE. [Standing at table.] I think they should neverbe forgiven.
LORD DARLINGTON. And men? Do you think that there should be thesame laws for men as there are for women?
LADY WINDERMERE. Certainly!
LORD DARLINGTON. I think life too complex a thing to be settled bythese hard and fast rules.
LADY WINDERMERE. If we had 'these hard and fast rules,' we should
find life much more simple.
LORD DARLINGTON. You allow of no exceptions?
LADY WINDERMERE. None!
LORD DARLINGTON. Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, LadyWindermere!
LADY WINDERMERE. The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Darlington.
LORD DARLINGTON. I couldn't help it. I can resist everythingexcept temptation.
LADY WINDERMERE. You have the modern affectation of weakness.
LORD DARLINGTON. [Looking at her.] It's only an affectation, LadyWindermere.
[Enter PARKER C.]
PARKER. The Duchess of Berwick and Lady Agatha Carlisle.
[Enter the DUCHESS OF BERWICK and LADY AGATHA CARLISLE C.]
[Exit PARKER C.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [Coming down C., and shaking hands.] DearMargaret, I am so pleased to see you. You remember Agatha, don'tyou? [Crossing L.C.] How do you do, Lord Darlington? I won't letyou know my daughter, you are far too wicked.
LORD DARLINGTON. Don't say that, Duchess. As a wicked man I am acomplete failure. Why, there are lots of people who say I havenever really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.Of course they only say it behind my back.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Isn't he dreadful? Agatha, this is LordDarlington. Mind you don't believe a word he says. [LORDDARLINGTON crosses R.C.] No, no tea, thank you, dear. [Crossesand sits on sofa.] We have just had tea at Lady Markby's. Suchbad tea, too. It was quite undrinkable. I wasn't at allsurprised. Her own son-in-law supplies it. Agatha is lookingforward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.
LADY WINDERMERE. [Seated L.C.] Oh, you mustn't think it is goingto be a ball, Duchess. It is only a dance in honour of mybirthday. A small and early.
LORD DARLINGTON. [Standing L.C.] Very small, very early, and veryselect, Duchess.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [On sofa L.] Of course it's going to beselect. But we know THAT, dear Margaret, about YOUR house. It isreally one of the few houses in London where I can take Agatha, andwhere I feel perfectly secure about dear Berwick. I don't knowwhat society is coming to. The most dreadful people seem to goeverywhere. They certainly come to my parties--the men get quitefurious if one doesn't ask them. Really, some one should make astand against it.
LADY WINDERMERE. _I_ will, Duchess. I will have no one in myhouse about whom there is any scandal.
LORD DARLINGTON. [R.C.] Oh, don't say that, Lady Windermere. Ishould never be admitted! [Sitting.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Oh, men don't matter. With women it isdifferent. We're good. Some of us are, at least. But we arepositively getting elbowed into the corner. Our husbands wouldreally forget our existence if we didn't nag at them from time totime, just to remind them that we have a perfect legal right to doso.
LORD DARLINGTON. It's a curious thing, Duchess, about the game ofmarriage--a game, by the way, that is going out of fashion--thewives hold all the honours, and invariably lose the odd trick.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. The odd trick? Is that the husband, LordDarlington?
LORD DARLINGTON. It would be rather a good name for the modernhusband.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Dear Lord Darlington, how thoroughly depravedyou are!
LADY WINDERMERE. Lord Darlington is trivial.
LORD DARLINGTON. Ah, don't say that, Lady Windermere.
LADY WINDERMERE. Why do you TALK so trivially about life, then?
LORD DARLINGTON. Because I think that life is far too important athing ever to talk seriously about it. [Moves up C.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. What does he mean? Do, as a concession to mypoor wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you reallymean.
LORD DARLINGTON. [Coming down back of table.] I think I hadbetter not, Duchess. Nowadays to be intelligible is to be foundout. Good-bye! [Shakes hands with DUCHESS.] And now--[goes upstage] Lady Windermere, good-bye. I may come to-night, mayn't I?Do let me come.
LADY WINDERMERE. [Standing up stage with LORD DARLINGTON.] Yes,certainly. But you are not to say foolish, insincere things topeople.
LORD DARLINGTON. [Smiling.] Ah! you are beginning to reform me.It is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere. [Bows,and exit C.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [Who has risen, goes C.] What a charming,wicked creature! I like him so much. I'm quite delighted he'sgone! How sweet you're looking! Where DO you get your gowns? Andnow I must tell you how sorry I am for you, dear Margaret.[Crosses to sofa and sits with LADY WINDERMERE.] Agatha, darling!
LADY AGATHA. Yes, mamma. [Rises.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Will you go and look over the photograph albumthat I see there?
LADY AGATHA. Yes, mamma. [Goes to table up L.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Dear girl! She is so fond of photographs ofSwitzerland. Such a pure taste, I think. But I really am so sorryfor you, Margaret
LADY WINDERMERE. [Smiling.] Why, Duchess?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Oh, on account of that horrid woman. Shedresses so well, too, which makes it much worse, sets such adreadful example. Augustus--you know my disreputable brother--sucha trial to us all--well, Augustus is completely infatuated abouther. It is quite scandalous, for she is absolutely inadmissibleinto society. Many a woman has a past, but I am told that she hasat least a dozen, and that they all fit.
LADY WINDERMERE. Whom are you talking about, Duchess?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. About Mrs. Erlynne.
LADY WINDERMERE. Mrs. Erlynne? I never heard of her, Duchess.And what HAS she to do with me?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. My poor child! Agatha, darling!
LADY AGATHA. Yes, mamma.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Will you go out on the terrace and look at thesunset?
LADY AGATHA. Yes, mamma. [Exit through window, L.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Sweet girl! So devoted to sunsets! Showssuch refinement of feeling, does it not? After all, there isnothing like Nature, is there?
LADY WINDERMERE. But what is it, Duchess? Why do you talk to meabout this person?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Don't you really know? I assure you we're allso distressed about it. Only last night at dear Lady Jansen'severy one was saying how extraordinary it was that, of all men inLondon, Windermere should behave in such a way.
LADY WINDERMERE. My husband--what has HE got to do with any womanof that kind?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Ah, what indeed, dear? That is the point. Hegoes to see her continually, and stops for hours at a time, andwhile he is there she is not at home to any one. Not that manyladies call on her, dear, but she has a great many disreputable menfriends--my own brother particularly, as I told you--and that iswhat makes it so dreadful about Windermere. We looked upon HIM asbeing such a model husband, but I am afraid there is no doubt aboutit. My dear nieces--you know the Saville girls, don't you?--suchnice domestic creatures--plain, dreadfully plain, but so good--well, they're always at the window doing fancy work, and makingugly things for the poor, which I think so useful of them in thesedreadful socialistic days, and this terrible woman has taken ahouse in Curzon Street, right opposite them--such a respectablestreet, too! I don't know what we're coming to! And they tell methat Windermere goes there four and five times a week--they SEEhim. They can't help it--and although they never talk scandal,they--well, of course--they remark on it to every one. And theworst of it all is that I have been told that this woman has got agreat deal of money out of somebody, for it seems that she came toLondon six months ago without anything at all to speak of, and nowshe has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her ponies in thePark every afternoon and all--well, all--since she has known poordear Windermere.
LADY WINDERMERE. Oh, I can't believe it!
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. But it's quite true, my dear. The whole ofLondon knows it. That is why I felt it was better to come and talkto you, and advise you to take Windermere away at once to Homburgor to Aix, where he'll have something to amuse him, and where youcan watch him all day long. I assure you, my dear, that on severaloccasions after I was first married, I had to pretend to be veryill, and was obliged to drink the most unpleasant mineral waters,merely to get Berwick out of town. He was so extremelysusceptible. Though I am bound to say he never gave away any largesums of money to anybody. He is far too high-principled for that!
LADY WINDERMERE. [Interrupting.] Duchess, Duchess, it'simpossible! [Rising and crossing stage to C.] We are only marriedtwo years. Our child is but six months old. [Sits in chair R. ofL. table.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Ah, the dear pretty baby! How is the littledarling? Is it a boy or a girl? I hope a girl--Ah, no, I rememberit's a boy! I'm so sorry. Boys are so wicked. My boy isexcessively immoral. You wouldn't believe at what hours he comeshome. And he's only left Oxford a few months--I really don't knowwhat they teach them there.
LADY WINDERMERE. Are ALL men bad?
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Oh, all of them, my dear, all of them, withoutany exception. And they never grow any better. Men become old,but they never become good.
LADY WINDERMERE. Windermere and I married for love.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Yes, we begin like that. It was onlyBerwick's brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made meaccept him at all, and before the year was out, he was runningafter all kinds of petticoats, every colour, every shape, everymaterial. In fact, before the honeymoon was over, I caught himwinking at my maid, a most pretty, respectable girl. I dismissedher at once without a character.--No, I remember I passed her on tomy sister; poor dear Sir George is so short-sighted, I thought itwouldn't matter. But it did, though--it was most unfortunate.[Rises.] And now, my dear child, I must go, as we are dining out.And mind you don't take this little aberration of Windermere's toomuch to heart. Just take him abroad, and he'll come back to youall right.
LADY WINDERMERE. Come back to me? [C.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [L.C.] Yes, dear, these wicked women get ourhusbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged,of course. And don't make scenes, men hate them!
LADY WINDERMERE. It is very kind of you, Duchess, to come and tellme all this. But I can't believe that my husband is untrue to me.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Pretty child! I was like that once. Now Iknow that all men are monsters. [LADY WINDERMERE rings bell.] Theonly thing to do is to feed the wretches well. A good cook doeswonders, and that I know you have. My dear Margaret, you are notgoing to cry?
LADY WINDERMERE. You needn't be afraid, Duchess, I never cry.
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. That's quite right, dear. Crying is therefuge of plain women but the ruin of pretty ones. Agatha,darling!
LADY AGATHA. [Entering L.] Yes, mamma. [Stands back of tableL.C.]
DUCHESS OF BERWICK. Come and bid good-bye to Lady Windermere, andthank her for your charming visit. [Coming down again.] And bythe way, I must thank you for sending a card to Mr. Hopper--he'sthat rich young Australian people are taking such notice of just atpresent. His father made a great fortune by selling some kind offood in circular tins--most palatable, I believe--I fancy it is thething the servants always refuse to eat. But the son is quiteinteresting. I think he's attracted by dear Agatha's clever talk.Of course, we should be very sorry to lose her, but I think that amother who doesn't part with a daughter every season has no realaffection. We're coming to-night, dear. [PARKER opens C. doors.]And remember my advice, take the poor fellow out of town at once,it is the only thing to do. Good-bye, once more; come, Agatha.
[Exeunt DUCHESS and LADY AGATHA C.]
LADY WINDERMERE. How horrible! I understand now what LordDarlington meant by the imaginary instance of the couple not twoyears married. Oh! it can't be true--she spoke of enormous sums ofmoney paid to this woman. I know where Arthur keeps his bank book--in one of the drawers of that desk. I might find out by that. IWILL find out. [Opens drawer.] No, it is some hideous mistake.[Rises and goes C.] Some silly scandal! He loves ME! He lovesME! But why should I not look? I am his wife, I have a right tolook! [Returns to bureau, takes out book and examines it page bypage, smiles and gives a sigh of relief.] I knew it! there is nota word of truth in this stupid story. [Puts book back in dranver.As the does so, starts and takes out another book.] A second book--private--locked! [Tries to open it, but fails. Sees paper knifeon bureau, and with it cuts cover from book. Begins to start atthe first page.] 'Mrs. Erlynne--600 pounds--Mrs. Erlynne--700pounds--Mrs. Erlynne--400 pounds.' Oh! it is true! It is true!How horrible! [Throws book on floor.] [Enter LORD WINDERMERE C.]
LORD WINDERMERE. Well, dear, has the fan been sent home yet?[Going R.C. Sees book.] Margaret, you have cut open my bank book.You have no right to do such a thing!
LADY WINDERMERE. You think it wrong that you are found out, don'tyou?
LORD WINDERMERE. I think it wrong that a wife should spy on herhusband.
LADY WINDERMERE. I did not spy on you. I never knew of thiswoman's existence till half an hour ago. Some one who pitied mewas kind enough to tell me what every one in London knows already--your daily visits to Curzon Street, your mad infatuation, themonstrous sums of money you squander on this infamous woman![Crossing L.]
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret! don't talk like that of Mrs. Erlynne,you don't know how unjust it is!
LADY WINDERMERE. [Turning to him.] You are very jealous of Mrs.Erlynne's honour. I wish you had been as jealous of mine.
LORD WINDERMERE. Your honour is untouched, Margaret. You don'tthink for a moment that--[Puts book back into desk.]
LADY WINDERMERE. I think that you spend your money strangely.That is all. Oh, don't imagine I mind about the money. As far asI am concerned, you may squander everything we have. But what I DOmind is that you who have loved me, you who have taught me to loveyou, should pass from the love that is given to the love that isbought. Oh, it's horrible! [Sits on sofa.] And it is I who feeldegraded! YOU don't feel anything. I feel stained, utterlystained. You can't realise how hideous the last six months seemsto me now--every kiss you have given me is tainted in my memory.
LORD WINDERMERE. [Crossing to her.] Don't say that, Margaret. Inever loved any one in the whole world but you.
LADY WINDERMERE. [Rises.] Who is this woman, then? Why do youtake a house for her?
LORD WINDERMERE. I did not take a house for her.
LADY WINDERMERE. You gave her the money to do it, which is thesame thing.
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne -
LADY WINDERMERE. Is there a Mr. Erlynne--or is he a myth?
LORD WINDERMERE. Her husband died many years ago. She is alone inthe world.
LADY WINDERMERE. No relations? [A pause.]
LORD WINDERMERE. None.
LADY WINDERMERE. Rather curious, isn't it? [L.]
LORD WINDERMERE. [L.C.] Margaret, I was saying to you--and I begyou to listen to me--that as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, shehas conducted herself well. If years ago -
LADY WINDERMERE. Oh! [Crossing R.C.] I don't want details abouther life!
LORD WINDERMERE. [C.] I am not going to give you any detailsabout her life. I tell you simply this--Mrs. Erlynne was oncehonoured, loved, respected. She was well born, she had position--she lost everything--threw it away, if you like. That makes it allthe more bitter. Misfortunes one can endure--they come fromoutside, they are accidents. But to suffer for one's own faults--ah!--there is the sting of life. It was twenty years ago, too.She was little more than a girl then. She had been a wife for evenless time than you have.
LADY WINDERMERE. I am not interested in her--and--you should notmention this woman and me in the same breath. It is an error oftaste. [Sitting R. at desk.]
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, you could save this woman. She wantsto get back into society, and she wants you to help her. [Crossingto her.]
LADY WINDERMERE. Me!
LORD WINDERMERE. Yes, you.
LADY WINDERMERE. How impertinent of her! [A pause.]
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, I came to ask you a great favour, and Istill ask it of you, though you have discovered what I had intendedyou should never have known that I have given Mrs. Erlynne a largesum of money. I want you to send her an invitation for our partyto-night. [Standing L. of her.]
LADY WINDERMERE. You are mad! [Rises.]
LORD WINDERMERE. I entreat you. People may chatter about her, dochatter about her, of course, but they don't know anything definiteagainst her. She has been to several houses--not to houses whereyou would go, I admit, but still to houses where women who are inwhat is called Society nowadays do go. That does not content her.She wants you to receive her once.
LADY WINDERMERE. As a triumph for her, I suppose?
LORD WINDERMERE. No; but because she knows that you are a goodwoman--and that if she comes here once she will have a chance of ahappier, a surer life than she has had. She will make no furthereffort to know you. Won't you help a woman who is trying to getback?
LADY WINDERMERE. No! If a woman really repents, she never wishesto return to the society that has made or seen her ruin.
LORD WINDERMERE. I beg of you.
LADY WINDERMERE. [Crossing to door R.] I am going to dress fordinner, and don't mention the subject again this evening. Arthur[going to him C.], you fancy because I have no father or motherthat I am alone in the world, and that you can treat me as youchoose. You are wrong, I have friends, many friends.
LORD WINDERMERE. [L.C.] Margaret, you are talking foolishly,recklessly. I won't argue with you, but I insist upon your askingMrs. Erlynne to-night.
LADY WINDERMERE. [R.C.] I shall do nothing of the kind.[Crossing L. C.]
LORD WINDERMERE. You refuse? [C.]
LADY WINDERMERE. Absolutely!
LORD WINDERMERE. Ah, Margaret, do this for my sake; it is her lastchance.
LADY WINDERMERE. What has that to do with me?
LORD WINDERMERE. How hard good women are!
LADY WINDERMERE. How weak bad men are!
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, none of us men may be good enough forthe women we marry--that is quite true--but you don't imagine Iwould ever--oh, the suggestion is monstrous!
LADY WINDERMERE. Why should YOU be different from other men? I amtold that there is hardly a husband in London who does not wastehis life over SOME shameful passion.
LORD WINDERMERE. I am not one of them.
LADY WINDERMERE. I am not sure of that!
LORD WINDERMERE. You are sure in your heart. But don't make chasmafter chasm between us. God knows the last few minutes have thrustus wide enough apart. Sit down and write the card.
LADY WINDERMERE. Nothing in the whole world would induce me.
LORD WINDERMERE. [Crossing to bureau.] Then I will! [Ringselectric bell, sits and writes card.]
LADY WINDERMERE. You are going to invite this woman? [Crossing tohim.]
LORD WINDERMERE. Yes. [Pause. Enter PARKER.] Parker!
PARKER. Yes, my lord. [Comes down L.C.]
LORD WINDERMERE. Have this note sent to Mrs. Erlynne at No. 84ACurzon Street. [Crossing to L.C. and giving note to PARKER.]There is no answer!
[Exit PARKER C.]
LADY WINDERMERE. Arthur, if that woman comes here, I shall insulther.
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, don't say that.
LADY WINDERMERE. I mean it.
LORD WINDERMERE. Child, if you did such a thing, there's not awoman in London who wouldn't pity you.
LADY WINDERMERE. There is not a GOOD woman in London who would notapplaud me. We have been too lax. We must make an example. Ipropose to begin to-night. [Picking up fan.] Yes, you gave methis fan to-day; it was your birthday present. If that womancrosses my threshold, I shall strike her across the face with it.
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, you couldn't do such a thing.
LADY WINDERMERE. You don't know me! [Moves R.]
[Enter PARKER.]
Parker!
PARKER. Yes, my lady.
LADY WINDERMERE. I shall dine in my own room. I don't wantdinner, in fact. See that everything is ready by half-past ten.And, Parker, be sure you pronounce the names of the guests verydistinctly to-night. Sometimes you speak so fast that I miss them.I am particularly anxious to hear the names quite clearly, so as tomake no mistake. You understand, Parker?
PARKER. Yes, my lady.
LADY WINDERMERE. That will do!
[Exit PARKER C.]
[Speaking to LORD WINDERMERE] Arthur, if that woman comes here--Iwarn you -
LORD WINDERMERE. Margaret, you'll ruin us!
LADY WINDERMERE. Us! From this moment my life is separate fromyours. But if you wish to avoid a public scandal, write at once tothis woman, and tell her that I forbid her to come here!
LORD WINDERMERE. I will not--I cannot--she must come!
LADY WINDERMERE. Then I shall do exactly as I have said. [GoesR.] You leave me no choice. [Exit R.]
LORD WINDERMERE. [Calling after her.] Margaret! Margaret! [Apause.] My God! What shall I do? I dare not tell her who thiswoman really is. The shame would kill her. [Sinks down into achair and buries his face in his hands.]
