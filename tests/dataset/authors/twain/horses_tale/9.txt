"Well, this is the way it happened.  We did the escort duty; thenwe came back and struck for the plain and put the Rangers through arousing drill - oh, for hours!  Then we sent them home underBrigadier-General Fanny Marsh; then the Lieutenant-General and Iwent off on a gallop over the plains for about three hours, andwere lazying along home in the middle of the afternoon, when we metJimmy Slade, the drummer-boy, and he saluted and asked theLieutenant-General if she had heard the news, and she said no, andhe said:
"'Buffalo Bill has been ambushed and badly shot this side ofClayton, and Thorndike the scout, too; Bill couldn't travel, butThorndike could, and he brought the news, and Sergeant Wilkes andsix men of Company B are gone, two hours ago, hotfoot, to get Bill.And they say - '
"'GO!' she shouts to me - and I went."
"Fast?"
"Don't ask foolish questions.  It was an awful pace.  For fourhours nothing happened, and not a word said, except that now andthen she said, 'Keep it up, Boy, keep it up, sweetheart; we'll savehim!'  I kept it up.  Well, when the dark shut down, in the ruggedhills, that poor little chap had been tearing around in the saddleall day, and I noticed by the slack knee-pressure that she wastired and tottery, and I got dreadfully afraid; but every time Itried to slow down and let her go to sleep, so I could stop, shehurried me up again; and so, sure enough, at last over she went!
"Ah, that was a fix to be in I for she lay there and didn't stir,and what was I to do?  I couldn't leave her to fetch help, onaccount of the wolves.  There was nothing to do but stand by.  Itwas dreadful.  I was afraid she was killed, poor little thing!  Butshe wasn't.  She came to, by-and-by, and said, 'Kiss me, Soldier,'and those were blessed words.  I kissed her - often; I am used tothat, and we like it.  But she didn't get up, and I was worried.She fondled my nose with her hand, and talked to me, and called meendearing names - which is her way - but she caressed with the samehand all the time.  The other arm was broken, you see, but I didn'tknow it, and she didn't mention it.  She didn't want to distressme, you know.
"Soon the big gray wolves came, and hung around, and you could hearthem snarl, and snap at each other, but you couldn't see anythingof them except their eyes, which shone in the dark like sparks andstars.  The Lieutenant-General said, 'If I had the Rocky MountainRangers here, we would make those creatures climb a tree.'  Thenshe made believe that the Rangers were in hearing, and put up herbugle and blew the 'assembly'; and then, 'boots and saddles'; thenthe 'trot'; 'gallop'; 'charge!'  Then she blew the 'retreat,' andsaid, 'That's for you, you rebels; the Rangers don't ever retreat!'
"The music frightened them away, but they were hungry, and keptcoming back.  And of course they got bolder and bolder, which istheir way.  It went on for an hour, then the tired child went tosleep, and it was pitiful to hear her moan and nestle, and Icouldn't do anything for her.  All the time I was laying for thewolves.  They are in my line; I have had experience.  At last theboldest one ventured within my lines, and I landed him among hisfriends with some of his skull still on him, and they did the rest.In the next hour I got a couple more, and they went the way of thefirst one, down the throats of the detachment.  That satisfied thesurvivors, and they went away and left us in peace.
"We hadn't any more adventures, though I kept awake all night andwas ready.  From midnight on the child got very restless, and outof her head, and moaned, and said, 'Water, water - thirsty'; andnow and then, 'Kiss me, Soldier'; and sometimes she was in her fortand giving orders to her garrison; and once she was in Spain, andthought her mother was with her.  People say a horse can't cry; butthey don't know, because we cry inside.
"It was an hour after sunup that I heard the boys coming, andrecognized the hoof-beats of Pomp and Caesar and Jerry, old matesof mine; and a welcomer sound there couldn't ever be.
Buffalo Bill was in a horse-litter, with his leg broken by abullet, and Mongrel and Blake Haskins's horse were doing the work.Buffalo Bill and Thorndike had lolled both of those toughs.
"When they got to us, and Buffalo Bill saw the child lying there sowhite, he said, 'My God!' and the sound of his voice brought her toherself, and she gave a little cry of pleasure and struggled to getup, but couldn't, and the soldiers gathered her up like thetenderest women, and their eyes were wet and they were not ashamed,when they saw her arm dangling; and so were Buffalo Bill's, andwhen they laid her in his arms he said, 'My darling, how does thiscome?' and she said, 'We came to save you, but I was tired, andcouldn't keep awake, and fell off and hurt myself, and couldn't geton again.'  'You came to save me, you dear little rat?  It was toolovely of you!'  'Yes, and Soldier stood by me, which you know hewould, and protected me from the wolves; and if he got a chance hekicked the life out of some of them - for you know he would, BB.'The sergeant said, 'He laid out three of them, sir, and here's thebones to show for it.'  'He's a grand horse,' said BB; 'he's thegrandest horse that ever was! and has saved your life, Lieutenant-General Alison, and shall protect it the rest of his life - he'syours for a kiss!'  He got it, along with a passion of delight, andhe said, 'You are feeling better now, little Spaniard - do youthink you could blow the advance?'  She put up the bugle to do it,but he said wait a minute first.  Then he and the sergeant set herarm and put it in splints, she wincing but not whimpering; then wetook up the march for home, and that's the end of the tale; and I'mher horse.  Isn't she a brick, Shekels?
"Brick?  She's more than a brick, more than a thousand bricks -she's a reptile!"
"It's a compliment out of your heart, Shekels.  God bless you forit!"
