Some of the Quaker City's passengers had arrived in Venice fromSwitzerland and other lands before we left there, and others wereexpected every day. We heard of no casualties among them, and nosickness.
We were a little fatigued with sight seeing, and so we rattled through agood deal of country by rail without caring to stop. I took few notes.I find no mention of Bologna in my memorandum book, except that wearrived there in good season, but saw none of the sausages for which theplace is so justly celebrated.
Pistoia awoke but a passing interest.
Florence pleased us for a while. I think we appreciated the great figureof David in the grand square, and the sculptured group they call the Rapeof the Sabines. We wandered through the endless collections of paintingsand statues of the Pitti and Ufizzi galleries, of course. I make thatstatement in self-defense; there let it stop. I could not rest under theimputation that I visited Florence and did not traverse its weary milesof picture galleries. We tried indolently to recollect something aboutthe Guelphs and Ghibelines and the other historical cut-throats whosequarrels and assassinations make up so large a share of Florentinehistory, but the subject was not attractive. We had been robbed of allthe fine mountain scenery on our little journey by a system ofrailroading that had three miles of tunnel to a hundred yards ofdaylight, and we were not inclined to be sociable with Florence. We hadseen the spot, outside the city somewhere, where these people had allowedthe bones of Galileo to rest in unconsecrated ground for an age becausehis great discovery that the world turned around was regarded as adamning heresy by the church; and we know that long after the world hadaccepted his theory and raised his name high in the list of its greatmen, they had still let him rot there. That we had lived to see his dustin honored sepulture in the church of Santa Croce we owed to a society ofliterati, and not to Florence or her rulers. We saw Dante's tomb in thatchurch, also, but we were glad to know that his body was not in it; thatthe ungrateful city that had exiled him and persecuted him would givemuch to have it there, but need not hope to ever secure that high honorto herself. Medicis are good enough for Florence. Let her plant Medicisand build grand monuments over them to testify how gratefully she waswont to lick the hand that scourged her.
Magnanimous Florence! Her jewelry marts are filled with artists inmosaic. Florentine mosaics are the choicest in all the world. Florenceloves to have that said. Florence is proud of it. Florence would fosterthis specialty of hers. She is grateful to the artists that bring to herthis high credit and fill her coffers with foreign money, and so sheencourages them with pensions. With pensions! Think of the lavishnessof it. She knows that people who piece together the beautiful triflesdie early, because the labor is so confining, and so exhausting to handand brain, and so she has decreed that all these people who reach the ageof sixty shall have a pension after that! I have not heard that any ofthem have called for their dividends yet. One man did fight along tillhe was sixty, and started after his pension, but it appeared that therehad been a mistake of a year in his family record, and so he gave it upand died.
These artists will take particles of stone or glass no larger than amustard seed, and piece them together on a sleeve button or a shirt stud,so smoothly and with such nice adjustment of the delicate shades of colorthe pieces bear, as to form a pigmy rose with stem, thorn, leaves, petalscomplete, and all as softly and as truthfully tinted as though Nature hadbuilded it herself. They will counterfeit a fly, or a high-toned bug, orthe ruined Coliseum, within the cramped circle of a breastpin, and do itso deftly and so neatly that any man might think a master painted it.
I saw a little table in the great mosaic school in Florence--a littletrifle of a centre table--whose top was made of some sort of preciouspolished stone, and in the stone was inlaid the figure of a flute, withbell-mouth and a mazy complication of keys. No painting in the worldcould have been softer or richer; no shading out of one tint into anothercould have been more perfect; no work of art of any kind could have beenmore faultless than this flute, and yet to count the multitude of littlefragments of stone of which they swore it was formed would bankrupt anyman's arithmetic! I do not think one could have seen where two particlesjoined each other with eyes of ordinary shrewdness. Certainly we coulddetect no such blemish. This table-top cost the labor of one man for tenlong years, so they said, and it was for sale for thirty-five thousanddollars.
We went to the Church of Santa Croce, from time to time, in Florence, toweep over the tombs of Michael Angelo, Raphael and Machiavelli,(I suppose they are buried there, but it may be that they resideelsewhere and rent their tombs to other parties--such being the fashionin Italy,) and between times we used to go and stand on the bridges andadmire the Arno. It is popular to admire the Arno. It is a greathistorical creek with four feet in the channel and some scows floatingaround. It would be a very plausible river if they would pump some waterinto it. They all call it a river, and they honestly think it is ariver, do these dark and bloody Florentines. They even help out thedelusion by building bridges over it. I do not see why they are too goodto wade.
How the fatigues and annoyances of travel fill one with bitter prejudicessometimes! I might enter Florence under happier auspices a month henceand find it all beautiful, all attractive. But I do not care to think ofit now, at all, nor of its roomy shops filled to the ceiling with snowymarble and alabaster copies of all the celebrated sculptures in Europe--copies so enchanting to the eye that I wonder how they can really beshaped like the dingy petrified nightmares they are the portraits of. Igot lost in Florence at nine o'clock, one night, and staid lost in thatlabyrinth of narrow streets and long rows of vast buildings that look allalike, until toward three o'clock in the morning. It was a pleasantnight and at first there were a good many people abroad, and there werecheerful lights about. Later, I grew accustomed to prowling aboutmysterious drifts and tunnels and astonishing and interesting myself withcoming around corners expecting to find the hotel staring me in the face,and not finding it doing any thing of the kind. Later still, I felttired. I soon felt remarkably tired. But there was no one abroad, now--not even a policeman. I walked till I was out of all patience, and veryhot and thirsty. At last, somewhere after one o'clock, I cameunexpectedly to one of the city gates. I knew then that I was very farfrom the hotel. The soldiers thought I wanted to leave the city, andthey sprang up and barred the way with their muskets. I said:
"Hotel d'Europe!"
It was all the Italian I knew, and I was not certain whether that wasItalian or French. The soldiers looked stupidly at each other and at me,and shook their heads and took me into custody. I said I wanted to gohome. They did not understand me. They took me into the guard-house andsearched me, but they found no sedition on me. They found a small pieceof soap (we carry soap with us, now,) and I made them a present of it,seeing that they regarded it as a curiosity. I continued to say Hoteld'Europe, and they continued to shake their heads, until at last a youngsoldier nodding in the corner roused up and said something. He said heknew where the hotel was, I suppose, for the officer of the guard senthim away with me. We walked a hundred or a hundred and fifty miles, itappeared to me, and then he got lost. He turned this way and that, andfinally gave it up and signified that he was going to spend the remainderof the morning trying to find the city gate again. At that moment itstruck me that there was something familiar about the house over the way.It was the hotel!
It was a happy thing for me that there happened to be a soldier therethat knew even as much as he did; for they say that the policy of thegovernment is to change the soldiery from one place to another constantlyand from country to city, so that they can not become acquainted with thepeople and grow lax in their duties and enter into plots and conspiracieswith friends. My experiences of Florence were chiefly unpleasant. Iwill change the subject.
At Pisa we climbed up to the top of the strangest structure the world hasany knowledge of--the Leaning Tower. As every one knows, it is in theneighborhood of one hundred and eighty feet high--and I beg to observethat one hundred and eighty feet reach to about the hight of fourordinary three-story buildings piled one on top of the other, and is avery considerable altitude for a tower of uniform thickness to aspire to,even when it stands upright--yet this one leans more than thirteen feetout of the perpendicular. It is seven hundred years old, but neitherhistory or tradition say whether it was built as it is, purposely, orwhether one of its sides has settled. There is no record that it everstood straight up. It is built of marble. It is an airy and a beautifulstructure, and each of its eight stories is encircled by fluted columns,some of marble and some of granite, with Corinthian capitals that werehandsome when they were new. It is a bell tower, and in its top hangs achime of ancient bells. The winding staircase within is dark, but onealways knows which side of the tower he is on because of his naturallygravitating from one side to the other of the staircase with the rise ordip of the tower. Some of the stone steps are foot-worn only on one end;others only on the other end; others only in the middle. To look downinto the tower from the top is like looking down into a tilted well. Arope that hangs from the centre of the top touches the wall before itreaches the bottom. Standing on the summit, one does not feel altogethercomfortable when he looks down from the high side; but to crawl on yourbreast to the verge on the lower side and try to stretch your neck outfar enough to see the base of the tower, makes your flesh creep, andconvinces you for a single moment in spite of all your philosophy, thatthe building is falling. You handle yourself very carefully, all thetime, under the silly impression that if it is not falling, your triflingweight will start it unless you are particular not to "bear down" on it.
The Duomo, close at hand, is one of the finest cathedrals in Europe. Itis eight hundred years old. Its grandeur has outlived the highcommercial prosperity and the political importance that made it anecessity, or rather a possibility. Surrounded by poverty, decay andruin, it conveys to us a more tangible impression of the former greatnessof Pisa than books could give us.
The Baptistery, which is a few years older than the Leaning Tower, is astately rotunda, of huge dimensions, and was a costly structure. In ithangs the lamp whose measured swing suggested to Galileo the pendulum.It looked an insignificant thing to have conferred upon the world ofscience and mechanics such a mighty extension of their dominions as ithas. Pondering, in its suggestive presence, I seemed to see a crazyuniverse of swinging disks, the toiling children of this sedate parent.He appeared to have an intelligent expression about him of knowing thathe was not a lamp at all; that he was a Pendulum; a pendulum disguised,for prodigious and inscrutable purposes of his own deep devising, and nota common pendulum either, but the old original patriarchal Pendulum--theAbraham Pendulum of the world.
This Baptistery is endowed with the most pleasing echo of all the echoeswe have read of. The guide sounded two sonorous notes, about half anoctave apart; the echo answered with the most enchanting, the mostmelodious, the richest blending of sweet sounds that one can imagine. Itwas like a long-drawn chord of a church organ, infinitely softened bydistance. I may be extravagant in this matter, but if this be the casemy ear is to blame--not my pen. I am describing a memory--and one thatwill remain long with me.
The peculiar devotional spirit of the olden time, which placed a higherconfidence in outward forms of worship than in the watchful guarding ofthe heart against sinful thoughts and the hands against sinful deeds, andwhich believed in the protecting virtues of inanimate objects made holyby contact with holy things, is illustrated in a striking manner in oneof the cemeteries of Pisa. The tombs are set in soil brought in shipsfrom the Holy Land ages ago. To be buried in such ground was regarded bythe ancient Pisans as being more potent for salvation than many massespurchased of the church and the vowing of many candles to the Virgin.
Pisa is believed to be about three thousand years old. It was one of thetwelve great cities of ancient Etruria, that commonwealth which has leftso many monuments in testimony of its extraordinary advancement, and solittle history of itself that is tangible and comprehensible. A Pisanantiquarian gave me an ancient tear-jug which he averred was full fourthousand years old. It was found among the ruins of one of the oldest ofthe Etruscan cities. He said it came from a tomb, and was used by somebereaved family in that remote age when even the Pyramids of Egypt wereyoung, Damascus a village, Abraham a prattling infant and ancient Troynot yet [dreampt] of, to receive the tears wept for some lost idol of ahousehold. It spoke to us in a language of its own; and with a pathosmore tender than any words might bring, its mute eloquence swept down thelong roll of the centuries with its tale of a vacant chair, a familiarfootstep missed from the threshold, a pleasant voice gone from thechorus, a vanished form!--a tale which is always so new to us, sostartling, so terrible, so benumbing to the senses, and behold howthreadbare and old it is! No shrewdly-worded history could have broughtthe myths and shadows of that old dreamy age before us clothed with humanflesh and warmed with human sympathies so vividly as did this poor littleunsentient vessel of pottery.
Pisa was a republic in the middle ages, with a government of her own,armies and navies of her own and a great commerce. She was a warlikepower, and inscribed upon her banners many a brilliant fight with Genoeseand Turks. It is said that the city once numbered a population of fourhundred thousand; but her sceptre has passed from her grasp, now, herships and her armies are gone, her commerce is dead. Her battle-flagsbear the mold and the dust of centuries, her marts are deserted, she hasshrunken far within her crumbling walls, and her great population hasdiminished to twenty thousand souls. She has but one thing left to boastof, and that is not much, viz: she is the second city of Tuscany.
We reached Leghorn in time to see all we wished to see of it long beforethe city gates were closed for the evening, and then came on board theship.
We felt as though we had been away from home an age. We never entirelyappreciated, before, what a very pleasant den our state-room is; nor howjolly it is to sit at dinner in one's own seat in one's own cabin, andhold familiar conversation with friends in one's own language. Oh, therare happiness of comprehending every single word that is said, andknowing that every word one says in return will be understood as well!We would talk ourselves to death, now, only there are only about tenpassengers out of the sixty-five to talk to. The others are wandering,we hardly know where. We shall not go ashore in Leghorn. We aresurfeited with Italian cities for the present, and much prefer to walkthe familiar quarterdeck and view this one from a distance.
The stupid magnates of this Leghorn government can not understand that solarge a steamer as ours could cross the broad Atlantic with no otherpurpose than to indulge a party of ladies and gentlemen in a pleasureexcursion. It looks too improbable. It is suspicious, they think.Something more important must be hidden behind it all. They can notunderstand it, and they scorn the evidence of the ship's papers. Theyhave decided at last that we are a battalion of incendiary, blood-thirstyGaribaldians in disguise! And in all seriousness they have set agun-boat to watch the vessel night and day, with orders to close down onany revolutionary movement in a twinkling! Police boats are on patrolduty about us all the time, and it is as much as a sailor's liberty isworth to show himself in a red shirt. These policemen follow theexecutive officer's boat from shore to ship and from ship to shore andwatch his dark maneuvres with a vigilant eye. They will arrest him yetunless he assumes an expression of countenance that shall have less ofcarnage, insurrection and sedition in it. A visit paid in a friendlyway to General Garibaldi yesterday (by cordial invitation,) by some ofour passengers, has gone far to confirm the dread suspicions thegovernment harbors toward us. It is thought the friendly visit was onlythe cloak of a bloody conspiracy. These people draw near and watch uswhen we bathe in the sea from the ship's side. Do they think we arecommuning with a reserve force of rascals at the bottom?
It is said that we shall probably be quarantined at Naples. Two or threeof us prefer not to run this risk. Therefore, when we are rested, wepropose to go in a French steamer to Civita and from thence to Rome, andby rail to Naples. They do not quarantine the cars, no matter where theygot their passengers from.
