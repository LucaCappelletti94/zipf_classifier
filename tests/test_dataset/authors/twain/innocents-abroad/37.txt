We anchored here at Yalta, Russia, two or three days ago. To me theplace was a vision of the Sierras. The tall, gray mountains that backit, their sides bristling with pines--cloven with ravines--here and therea hoary rock towering into view--long, straight streaks sweeping downfrom the summit to the sea, marking the passage of some avalanche offormer times--all these were as like what one sees in the Sierras as ifthe one were a portrait of the other. The little village of Yaltanestles at the foot of an amphitheatre which slopes backward and upwardto the wall of hills, and looks as if it might have sunk quietly down toits present position from a higher elevation. This depression is coveredwith the great parks and gardens of noblemen, and through the mass ofgreen foliage the bright colors of their palaces bud out here and therelike flowers. It is a beautiful spot.
We had the United States Consul on board--the Odessa Consul. Weassembled in the cabin and commanded him to tell us what we must do to besaved, and tell us quickly. He made a speech. The first thing he saidfell like a blight on every hopeful spirit: he had never seen a courtreception. (Three groans for the Consul.) But he said he had seenreceptions at the Governor General's in Odessa, and had often listened topeople's experiences of receptions at the Russian and other courts, andbelieved he knew very well what sort of ordeal we were about to essay.(Hope budded again.) He said we were many; the summer palace was small--a mere mansion; doubtless we should be received in summer fashion--in thegarden; we would stand in a row, all the gentlemen in swallow-tail coats,white kids, and white neck-ties, and the ladies in light-colored silks,or something of that kind; at the proper moment--12 meridian--theEmperor, attended by his suite arrayed in splendid uniforms, would appearand walk slowly along the line, bowing to some, and saying two or threewords to others. At the moment his Majesty appeared, a universal,delighted, enthusiastic smile ought to break out like a rash among thepassengers--a smile of love, of gratification, of admiration--and withone accord, the party must begin to bow--not obsequiously, butrespectfully, and with dignity; at the end of fifteen minutes the Emperorwould go in the house, and we could run along home again. We feltimmensely relieved. It seemed, in a manner, easy. There was not a manin the party but believed that with a little practice he could stand in arow, especially if there were others along; there was not a man butbelieved he could bow without tripping on his coat tail and breaking hisneck; in a word, we came to believe we were equal to any item in theperformance except that complicated smile. The Consul also said we oughtto draft a little address to the Emperor, and present it to one of hisaides-de-camp, who would forward it to him at the proper time.Therefore, five gentlemen were appointed to prepare the document, and thefifty others went sadly smiling about the ship--practicing. During thenext twelve hours we had the general appearance, somehow, of being at afuneral, where every body was sorry the death had occurred, but glad itwas over--where every body was smiling, and yet broken-hearted.
A committee went ashore to wait on his Excellency the Governor-General,and learn our fate. At the end of three hours of boding suspense, theycame back and said the Emperor would receive us at noon the next day--would send carriages for us--would hear the address in person. The GrandDuke Michael had sent to invite us to his palace also. Any man could seethat there was an intention here to show that Russia's friendship forAmerica was so genuine as to render even her private citizens objectsworthy of kindly attentions.
At the appointed hour we drove out three miles, and assembled in thehandsome garden in front of the Emperor's palace.
We formed a circle under the trees before the door, for there was no oneroom in the house able to accommodate our three-score personscomfortably, and in a few minutes the imperial family came out bowing andsmiling, and stood in our midst. A number of great dignitaries of theEmpire, in undress unit forms, came with them. With every bow, hisMajesty said a word of welcome. I copy these speeches. There ischaracter in them--Russian character--which is politeness itself, and thegenuine article. The French are polite, but it is often mere ceremoniouspoliteness. A Russian imbues his polite things with a heartiness, bothof phrase and expression, that compels belief in their sincerity. As Iwas saying, the Czar punctuated his speeches with bows:
"Good morning--I am glad to see you--I am gratified--I am delighted--I amhappy to receive you!"
All took off their hats, and the Consul inflicted the address on him. Hebore it with unflinching fortitude; then took the rusty-looking documentand handed it to some great officer or other, to be filed away among thearchives of Russia--in the stove. He thanked us for the address, andsaid he was very much pleased to see us, especially as such friendlyrelations existed between Russia and the United States. The Empress saidthe Americans were favorites in Russia, and she hoped the Russians weresimilarly regarded in America. These were all the speeches that weremade, and I recommend them to parties who present policemen with goldwatches, as models of brevity and point. After this the Empress went andtalked sociably (for an Empress) with various ladies around the circle;several gentlemen entered into a disjointed general conversation with theEmperor; the Dukes and Princes, Admirals and Maids of Honor dropped intofree-and-easy chat with first one and then another of our party, andwhoever chose stepped forward and spoke with the modest little GrandDuchess Marie, the Czar's daughter. She is fourteen years old,light-haired, blue-eyed, unassuming and pretty. Every body talksEnglish.
The Emperor wore a cap, frock coat and pantaloons, all of some kind ofplain white drilling--cotton or linen and sported no jewelry or anyinsignia whatever of rank. No costume could be less ostentatious. He isvery tall and spare, and a determined-looking man, though a verypleasant-looking one nevertheless. It is easy to see that he is kind andaffectionate There is something very noble in his expression when his capis off. There is none of that cunning in his eye that all of us noticedin Louis Napoleon's.
The Empress and the little Grand Duchess wore simple suits of foulard(or foulard silk, I don't know which is proper,) with a small blue spotin it; the dresses were trimmed with blue; both ladies wore broad bluesashes about their waists; linen collars and clerical ties of muslin;low-crowned straw-hats trimmed with blue velvet; parasols andflesh-colored gloves. The Grand Duchess had no heels on her shoes. Ido not know this of my own knowledge, but one of our ladies told me so.I was not looking at her shoes. I was glad to observe that she wore herown hair, plaited in thick braids against the back of her head, insteadof the uncomely thing they call a waterfall, which is about as much likea waterfall as a canvas-covered ham is like a cataract. Taking the kindexpression that is in the Emperor's face and the gentleness that is inhis young daughter's into consideration, I wondered if it would not taxthe Czar's firmness to the utmost to condemn a supplicating wretch tomisery in the wastes of Siberia if she pleaded for him. Every timetheir eyes met, I saw more and more what a tremendous power that weak,diffident school-girl could wield if she chose to do it. Many and manya time she might rule the Autocrat of Russia, whose lightest word is lawto seventy millions of human beings! She was only a girl, and shelooked like a thousand others I have seen, but never a girl provokedsuch a novel and peculiar interest in me before. A strange, newsensation is a rare thing in this hum-drum life, and I had it here.There was nothing stale or worn out about the thoughts and feelings thesituation and the circumstances created. It seemed strange--strangerthan I can tell--to think that the central figure in the cluster of menand women, chatting here under the trees like the most ordinaryindividual in the land, was a man who could open his lips and shipswould fly through the waves, locomotives would speed over the plains,couriers would hurry from village to village, a hundred telegraphs wouldflash the word to the four corners of an Empire that stretches its vastproportions over a seventh part of the habitable globe, and a countlessmultitude of men would spring to do his bidding. I had a sort of vaguedesire to examine his hands and see if they were of flesh and blood,like other men's. Here was a man who could do this wonderful thing, andyet if I chose I could knock him down. The case was plain, but itseemed preposterous, nevertheless--as preposterous as trying to knockdown a mountain or wipe out a continent. If this man sprained hisankle, a million miles of telegraph would carry the news over mountains--valleys--uninhabited deserts--under the trackless sea--and ten thousandnewspapers would prate of it; if he were grievously ill, all the nationswould know it before the sun rose again; if he dropped lifeless where hestood, his fall might shake the thrones of half a world! If I couldhave stolen his coat, I would have done it. When I meet a man likethat, I want something to remember him by.
As a general thing, we have been shown through palaces by someplush-legged filagreed flunkey or other, who charged a franc for it; butafter talking with the company half an hour, the Emperor of Russia andhis family conducted us all through their mansion themselves. They madeno charge. They seemed to take a real pleasure in it.
We spent half an hour idling through the palace, admiring the cosyapartments and the rich but eminently home-like appointments of theplace, and then the Imperial family bade our party a kind good-bye, andproceeded to count the spoons.
An invitation was extended to us to visit the palace of the eldest son,the Crown Prince of Russia, which was near at hand. The young man wasabsent, but the Dukes and Countesses and Princes went over the premiseswith us as leisurely as was the case at the Emperor's, and conversationcontinued as lively as ever.
It was a little after one o'clock, now. We drove to the Grand DukeMichael's, a mile away, in response to his invitation, previously given.
We arrived in twenty minutes from the Emperor's. It is a lovely place.The beautiful palace nestles among the grand old groves of the park, thepark sits in the lap of the picturesque crags and hills, and both lookout upon the breezy ocean. In the park are rustic seats, here and there,in secluded nooks that are dark with shade; there are rivulets of crystalwater; there are lakelets, with inviting, grassy banks; there areglimpses of sparkling cascades through openings in the wilderness offoliage; there are streams of clear water gushing from mimic knots on thetrunks of forest trees; there are miniature marble temples perched upongray old crags; there are airy lookouts whence one may gaze upon a broadexpanse of landscape and ocean. The palace is modeled after the choicestforms of Grecian architecture, and its wide colonnades surround a centralcourt that is banked with rare flowers that fill the place with theirfragrance, and in their midst springs a fountain that cools the summerair, and may possibly breed mosquitoes, but I do not think it does.
The Grand Duke and his Duchess came out, and the presentation ceremonieswere as simple as they had been at the Emperor's. In a few minutes,conversation was under way, as before. The Empress appeared in theverandah, and the little Grand Duchess came out into the crowd. They hadbeaten us there. In a few minutes, the Emperor came himself onhorseback. It was very pleasant. You can appreciate it if you have evervisited royalty and felt occasionally that possibly you might be wearingout your welcome--though as a general thing, I believe, royalty is notscrupulous about discharging you when it is done with you.
The Grand Duke is the third brother of the Emperor, is about thirty-sevenyears old, perhaps, and is the princeliest figure in Russia. He is eventaller than the Czar, as straight as an Indian, and bears himself likeone of those gorgeous knights we read about in romances of the Crusades.He looks like a great-hearted fellow who would pitch an enemy into theriver in a moment, and then jump in and risk his life fishing him outagain. The stories they tell of him show him to be of a brave andgenerous nature. He must have been desirous of proving that Americanswere welcome guests in the imperial palaces of Russia, because he rodeall the way to Yalta and escorted our procession to the Emperor'shimself, and kept his aids scurrying about, clearing the road andoffering assistance wherever it could be needed. We were rather familiarwith him then, because we did not know who he was. We recognized himnow, and appreciated the friendly spirit that prompted him to do us afavor that any other Grand Duke in the world would have doubtlessdeclined to do. He had plenty of servitors whom he could have sent, buthe chose to attend to the matter himself.
The Grand Duke was dressed in the handsome and showy uniform of a Cossackofficer. The Grand Duchess had on a white alpaca robe, with the seamsand gores trimmed with black barb lace, and a little gray hat with afeather of the same color. She is young, rather pretty modest andunpretending, and full of winning politeness.
Our party walked all through the house, and then the nobility escortedthem all over the grounds, and finally brought them back to the palaceabout half-past two o'clock to breakfast. They called it breakfast, butwe would have called it luncheon. It consisted of two kinds of wine;tea, bread, cheese, and cold meats, and was served on the centre-tablesin the reception room and the verandahs--anywhere that was convenient;there was no ceremony. It was a sort of picnic. I had heard before thatwe were to breakfast there, but Blucher said he believed Baker's boy hadsuggested it to his Imperial Highness. I think not--though it would belike him. Baker's boy is the famine-breeder of the ship. He is alwayshungry. They say he goes about the state-rooms when the passengers areout, and eats up all the soap. And they say he eats oakum. They say hewill eat any thing he can get between meals, but he prefers oakum. Hedoes not like oakum for dinner, but he likes it for a lunch, at oddhours, or any thing that way. It makes him very disagreeable, because itmakes his breath bad, and keeps his teeth all stuck up with tar. Baker'sboy may have suggested the breakfast, but I hope he did not. It went offwell, anyhow. The illustrious host moved about from place to place, andhelped to destroy the provisions and keep the conversation lively, andthe Grand Duchess talked with the verandah parties and such as hadsatisfied their appetites and straggled out from the reception room.
The Grand Duke's tea was delicious. They give one a lemon to squeezeinto it, or iced milk, if he prefers it. The former is best. This teais brought overland from China. It injures the article to transport itby sea.
When it was time to go, we bade our distinguished hosts good-bye, andthey retired happy and contented to their apartments to count theirspoons.
We had spent the best part of half a day in the home of royalty, and hadbeen as cheerful and comfortable all the time as we could have been inthe ship. I would as soon have thought of being cheerful in Abraham'sbosom as in the palace of an Emperor. I supposed that Emperors wereterrible people. I thought they never did any thing but wear magnificentcrowns and red velvet dressing-gowns with dabs of wool sewed on them inspots, and sit on thrones and scowl at the flunkies and the people in theparquette, and order Dukes and Duchesses off to execution. I find,however, that when one is so fortunate as to get behind the scenes andsee them at home and in the privacy of their firesides, they arestrangely like common mortals. They are pleasanter to look upon thenthan they are in their theatrical aspect. It seems to come as natural tothem to dress and act like other people as it is to put a friend's cedarpencil in your pocket when you are done using it. But I can never haveany confidence in the tinsel kings of the theatre after this. It will bea great loss. I used to take such a thrilling pleasure in them. But,hereafter, I will turn me sadly away and say;
"This does not answer--this isn't the style of king that I am acquaintedwith."
When they swagger around the stage in jeweled crowns and splendid robes,I shall feel bound to observe that all the Emperors that ever I waspersonally acquainted with wore the commonest sort of clothes, and didnot swagger. And when they come on the stage attended by a vastbody-guard of supes in helmets and tin breastplates, it will be my dutyas well as my pleasure to inform the ignorant that no crowned head of myacquaintance has a soldier any where about his house or his person.
Possibly it may be thought that our party tarried too long, or did otherimproper things, but such was not the case. The company felt that theywere occupying an unusually responsible position--they were representingthe people of America, not the Government--and therefore they werecareful to do their best to perform their high mission with credit.
On the other hand, the Imperial families, no doubt, considered that inentertaining us they were more especially entertaining the people ofAmerica than they could by showering attentions on a whole platoon ofministers plenipotentiary and therefore they gave to the event itsfullest significance, as an expression of good will and friendly feelingtoward the entire country. We took the kindnesses we received asattentions thus directed, of course, and not to ourselves as a party.That we felt a personal pride in being received as the representatives ofa nation, we do not deny; that we felt a national pride in the warmcordiality of that reception, can not be doubted.
Our poet has been rigidly suppressed, from the time we let go the anchor.When it was announced that we were going to visit the Emperor of Russia,the fountains of his great deep were broken up, and he rained ineffablebosh for four-and-twenty hours. Our original anxiety as to what we weregoing to do with ourselves, was suddenly transformed into anxiety aboutwhat we were going to do with our poet. The problem was solved at last.Two alternatives were offered him--he must either swear a dreadful oaththat he would not issue a line of his poetry while he was in the Czar'sdominions, or else remain under guard on board the ship until we weresafe at Constantinople again. He fought the dilemma long, but yielded atlast. It was a great deliverance. Perhaps the savage reader would likea specimen of his style. I do not mean this term to be offensive. Ionly use it because "the gentle reader" has been used so often that anychange from it can not but be refreshing:
 "Save us and sanctify us, and finally, then, See good provisions we enjoy while we journey to Jerusalem. For so man proposes, which it is most true And time will wait for none, nor for us too."
The sea has been unusually rough all day. However, we have had alively time of it, anyhow. We have had quite a run of visitors. TheGovernor-General came, and we received him with a salute of nine guns.He brought his family with him. I observed that carpets were spreadfrom the pier-head to his carriage for him to walk on, though I haveseen him walk there without any carpet when he was not on business. Ithought may be he had what the accidental insurance people might call anextra-hazardous polish ("policy" joke, but not above mediocrity,) on hisboots, and wished to protect them, but I examined and could not see thatthey were blacked any better than usual. It may have been that he hadforgotten his carpet, before, but he did not have it with him, anyhow.He was an exceedingly pleasant old gentleman; we all liked him,especially Blucher. When he went away, Blucher invited him to comeagain and fetch his carpet along.
Prince Dolgorouki and a Grand Admiral or two, whom we had seen yesterdayat the reception, came on board also. I was a little distant with theseparties, at first, because when I have been visiting Emperors I do notlike to be too familiar with people I only know by reputation, and whosemoral characters and standing in society I can not be thoroughlyacquainted with. I judged it best to be a little offish, at first. Isaid to myself, Princes and Counts and Grand Admirals are very well, butthey are not Emperors, and one can not be too particular about who heassociates with.
Baron Wrangel came, also. He used to be Russian Ambassador atWashington. I told him I had an uncle who fell down a shaft and brokehimself in two, as much as a year before that. That was a falsehood, butthen I was not going to let any man eclipse me on surprising adventures,merely for the want of a little invention. The Baron is a fine man, andis said to stand high in the Emperor's confidence and esteem.
Baron Ungern-Sternberg, a boisterous, whole-souled old nobleman, camewith the rest. He is a man of progress and enterprise--a representativeman of the age. He is the Chief Director of the railway system ofRussia--a sort of railroad king. In his line he is making things movealong in this country He has traveled extensively in America. He says hehas tried convict labor on his railroads, and with perfect success. Hesays the convicts work well, and are quiet and peaceable. He observedthat he employs nearly ten thousand of them now.
This appeared to be another call on my resources. I was equal to theemergency. I said we had eighty thousand convicts employed on therailways in America--all of them under sentence of death for murder inthe first degree. That closed him out.
We had General Todtleben (the famous defender of Sebastopol, during thesiege,) and many inferior army and also navy officers, and a number ofunofficial Russian ladies and gentlemen. Naturally, a champagne luncheonwas in order, and was accomplished without loss of life. Toasts andjokes were discharged freely, but no speeches were made save one thankingthe Emperor and the Grand Duke, through the Governor-General, for ourhospitable reception, and one by the Governor-General in reply, in whichhe returned the Emperor's thanks for the speech, etc., etc.
