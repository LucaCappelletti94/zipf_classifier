AMONG the many debts which we owe to the supreme aesthetic facultyof Goethe is that he was the first to teach us to define beauty interms the most concrete possible, to realise it, I mean, always inits special manifestations. So, in the lecture which I have thehonour to deliver before you, I will not try to give you anyabstract definition of beauty - any such universal formula for itas was sought for by the philosophy of the eighteenth century -still less to communicate to you that which in its essence isincommunicable, the virtue by which a particular picture or poemaffects us with a unique and special joy; but rather to point outto you the general ideas which characterise the great EnglishRenaissance of Art in this century, to discover their source, asfar as that is possible, and to estimate their future as far asthat is possible.
I call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort ofnew birth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian Renaissanceof the fifteenth century, in its desire for a more gracious andcomely way of life, its passion for physical beauty, its exclusiveattention to form, its seeking for new subjects for poetry, newforms of art, new intellectual and imaginative enjoyments: and Icall it our romantic movement because it is our most recentexpression of beauty.
It has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of thought,and again as a mere revival of mediaeval feeling. Rather I wouldsay that to these forms of the human spirit it has added whateverof artistic value the intricacy and complexity and experience ofmodern life can give: taking from the one its clearness of visionand its sustained calm, from the other its variety of expressionand the mystery of its vision. For what, as Goethe said, is thestudy of the ancients but a return to the real world (for that iswhat they did); and what, said Mazzini, is mediaevalism butindividuality?
It is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, itssanity of purpose, its calm possession of beauty, with theadventive, the intensified individualism, the passionate colour ofthe romantic spirit, that springs the art of the nineteenth centuryin England, as from the marriage of Faust and Helen of Troy sprangthe beautiful boy Euphorion.
Such expressions as 'classical' and 'romantic' are, it is true,often apt to become the mere catchwords of schools. We must alwaysremember that art has only one sentence to utter: there is for heronly one high law, the law of form or harmony - yet between theclassical and romantic spirit we may say that there lies thisdifference at least, that the one deals with the type and the otherwith the exception. In the work produced under the modern romanticspirit it is no longer the permanent, the essential truths of lifethat are treated of; it is the momentary situation of the one, themomentary aspect of the other that art seeks to render. Insculpture, which is the type of one spirit, the subjectpredominates over the situation; in painting, which is the type ofthe other, the situation predominates over the subject.
There are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the spirit ofromance may be taken as forming the essential elements of ourconscious intellectual tradition, of our permanent standard oftaste. As regards their origin, in art as in politics there is butone origin for all revolutions, a desire on the part of man for anobler form of life, for a freer method and opportunity ofexpression. Yet, I think that in estimating the sensuous andintellectual spirit which presides over our English Renaissance,any attempt to isolate it in any way from in the progress andmovement and social life of the age that has produced it would beto rob it of its true vitality, possibly to mistake its truemeaning. And in disengaging from the pursuits and passions of thiscrowded modern world those passions and pursuits which have to dowith art and the love of art, we must take into account many greatevents of history which seem to be the most opposed to any suchartistic feeling.
Alien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harshvoice of a rude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance mustseem, in its passionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless devotionto form, its exclusive and sensitive nature, it is to the FrenchRevolution that we must look for the most primary factor of itsproduction, the first condition of its birth: that greatRevolution of which we are all the children though the voices ofsome of us be often loud against it; that Revolution to which at atime when even such spirits as Coleridge and Wordsworth lost heartin England, noble messages of love blown across seas came from youryoung Republic.
It is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history hasshown us that neither in politics nor in nature are thererevolutions ever but evolutions only, and that the prelude to thatwild storm which swept over France in 1789 and made every king inEurope tremble for his throne, was first sounded in literatureyears before the Bastille fell and the Palace was taken. The wayfor those red scenes by Seine and Loire was paved by that criticalspirit of Germany and England which accustomed men to bring allthings to the test of reason or utility or both, while thediscontent of the people in the streets of Paris was the echo thatfollowed the life of Emile and of Werther. For Rousseau, by silentlake and mountain, had called humanity back to the golden age thatstill lies before us and preached a return to nature, in passionateeloquence whose music still lingers about our keen northern air.And Goethe and Scott had brought romance back again from the prisonshe had lain in for so many centuries - and what is romance buthumanity?
Yet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm andterror of that wild time, tendencies were hidden away that theartistic Renaissance bent to her own service when the time came - ascientific tendency first, which has borne in our own day a broodof somewhat noisy Titans, yet in the sphere of poetry has not beenunproductive of good. I do not mean merely in its adding toenthusiasm that intellectual basis which in its strength, or thatmore obvious influence about which Wordsworth was thinking when hesaid very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned expressionin the face of science, and that when science would put on a formof flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid thetransfiguration. Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotionand deep pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its firstand Swinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influenceon the artistic spirit in preserving that close observation and thesense of limitation as well as of clearness of vision which are thecharacteristics of the real artist.
The great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote WilliamBlake, is that the more distinct, sharp and defined the boundaryline, the more perfect is the work of art; and the less keen andsharp the greater is the evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism andbungling. 'Great inventors in all ages knew this - Michael Angeloand Albert Durer are known by this and by this alone'; and anothertime he wrote, with all the simple directness of nineteenth-centuryprose, 'to generalise is to be an idiot.'
And this love of definite conception, this clearness of vision,this artistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of all greatwork and poetry; of the vision of Homer as of the vision of Dante,of Keats and William Morris as of Chaucer and Theocritus. It liesat the base of all noble, realistic and romantic work as opposed tothe colourless and empty abstractions of our own eighteenth-centurypoets and of the classical dramatists of France, or of the vaguespiritualities of the German sentimental school: opposed, too, tothat spirit of transcendentalism which also was root and floweritself of the great Revolution, underlying the impassionedcontemplation of Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to the eagle-like flight of Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy,though displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day,bequeathed two great schools of thought, the school of Newman toOxford, the school of Emerson to America. Yet is this spirit oftranscendentalism alien to the spirit of art. For the artist canaccept no sphere of life in exchange for life itself. For himthere is no escape from the bondage of the earth: there is noteven the desire of escape.
He is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is theessence of the transcendental spirit, is alien to him. Themetaphysical mind of Asia will create for itself the monstrous,many-breasted idol of Ephesus, but to the Greek, pure artist, thatwork is most instinct with spiritual life which conforms mostclearly to the perfect facts of physical life.
'The storm of revolution,' as Andre Chenier said, 'blows out thetorch of poetry.' It is not for some little time that the realinfluence of such a wild cataclysm of things is felt: at first thedesire for equality seems to have produced personalities of moregiant and Titan stature than the world had ever known before. Menheard the lyre of Byron and the legions of Napoleon; it was aperiod of measureless passions and of measureless despair;ambition, discontent, were the chords of life and art; the age wasan age of revolt: a phase through which the human spirit mustpass, but one in which it cannot rest. For the aim of culture isnot rebellion but peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armiesclash by night being no dwelling-place meet for her to whom thegods have assigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear,untroubled air.
And soon that desire for perfection, which lay at the base of theRevolution, found in a young English poet its most complete andflawless realisation.
Phidias and the achievements of Greek art are foreshadowed inHomer: Dante prefigures for us the passion and colour andintensity of Italian painting: the modern love of landscape datesfrom Rousseau, and it is in Keats that one discerns the beginningof the artistic renaissance of England.
Byron was a rebel and Shelley a dreamer; but in the calmness andclearness of his vision, his perfect self-control, his unerringsense of beauty and his recognition of a separate realm for theimagination, Keats was the pure and serene artist, the forerunnerof the pre-Raphaelite school, and so of the great romantic movementof which I am to speak.
Blake had indeed, before him, claimed for art a lofty, spiritualmission, and had striven to raise design to the ideal level ofpoetry and music, but the remoteness of his vision both in paintingand poetry and the incompleteness of his technical powers had beenadverse to any real influence. It is in Keats that the artisticspirit of this century first found its absolute incarnation.
And these pre-Raphaelites, what were they? If you ask nine-tenthsof the British public what is the meaning of the word aesthetics,they will tell you it is the French for affectation or the Germanfor a dado; and if you inquire about the pre-Raphaelites you willhear something about an eccentric lot of young men to whom a sortof divine crookedness and holy awkwardness in drawing were thechief objects of art. To know nothing about their great men is oneof the necessary elements of English education.
As regards the pre-Raphaelites the story is simple enough. In theyear 1847 a number of young men in London, poets and painters,passionate admirers of Keats all of them, formed the habit ofmeeting together for discussions on art, the result of suchdiscussions being that the English Philistine public was rousedsuddenly from its ordinary apathy by hearing that there was in itsmidst a body of young men who had determined to revolutioniseEnglish painting and poetry. They called themselves the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.
In England, then as now, it was enough for a man to try and produceany serious beautiful work to lose all his rights as a citizen; andbesides this, the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - among whom the namesof Dante Rossetti, Holman Hunt and Millais will be familiar to you- had on their side three things that the English public neverforgives: youth, power and enthusiasm.
Satire, always as sterile as it in shameful and as impotent as itis insolent, paid them that usual homage which mediocrity pays togenius - doing, here as always, infinite harm to the public,blinding them to what is beautiful, teaching them that irreverencewhich is the source of all vileness and narrowness of life, butharming the artist not at all, rather confirming him in the perfectrightness of his work and ambition. For to disagree with three-fourths of the British public on all points is one of the firstelements of sanity, one of the deepest consolations in all momentsof spiritual doubt.
As regards the ideas these young men brought to the regeneration ofEnglish art, we may see at the base of their artistic creations adesire for a deeper spiritual value to be given to art as well as amore decorative value.
Pre-Raphaelites they called themselves; not that they imitated theearly Italian masters at all, but that in their work, as opposed tothe facile abstractions of Raphael, they found a stronger realismof imagination, a more careful realism of technique, a vision atonce more fervent and more vivid, an individuality more intimateand more intense.
For it is not enough that a work of art should conform to theaesthetic demands of its age: there must be also about it, if itis to affect us with any permanent delight, the impress of adistinct individuality, an individuality remote from that ofordinary men, and coming near to us only by virtue of a certainnewness and wonder in the work, and through channels whose verystrangeness makes us more ready to give them welcome.
LA PERSONNALITE, said one of the greatest of modem French critics,VOILE CE QUI NOUS SAUVERA.
But above all things was it a return to Nature - that formula whichseems to suit so many and such diverse movements: they would drawand paint nothing but what they saw, they would try and imaginethings as they really happened. Later there came to the old houseby Blackfriars Bridge, where this young brotherhood used to meetand work, two young men from Oxford, Edward Burne-Jones and WilliamMorris - the latter substituting for the simpler realism of theearly days a more exquisite spirit of choice, a more faultlessdevotion to beauty, a more intense seeking for perfection: amaster of all exquisite design and of all spiritual vision. It isof the school of Florence rather than of that of Venice that he iskinsman, feeling that the close imitation of Nature is a disturbingelement in imaginative art. The visible aspect of modern lifedisturbs him not; rather is it for him to render eternal all thatis beautiful in Greek, Italian, and Celtic legend. To Morris weowe poetry whose perfect precision and clearness of word and visionhas not been excelled in the literature of our country, and by therevival of the decorative arts he has given to our individualisedromantic movement the social idea and the social factor also.
But the revolution accomplished by this clique of young men, withRuskin's faultless and fervent eloquence to help them, was not oneof ideas merely but of execution, not one of conceptions but ofcreations.
For the great eras in the history of the development of all thearts have been eras not of increased feeling or enthusiasm infeeling for art, but of new technical improvements primarily andspecially. The discovery of marble quarries in the purple ravinesof Pentelicus and on the little low-lying hills of the island ofParos gave to the Greeks the opportunity for that intensifiedvitality of action, that more sensuous and simple humanism, towhich the Egyptian sculptor working laboriously in the hardporphyry and rose-coloured granite of the desert could not attain.The splendour of the Venetian school began with the introduction ofthe new oil medium for painting. The progress in modern music hasbeen due to the invention of new instruments entirely, and in noway to an increased consciousness on the part of the musician ofany wider social aim. The critic may try and trace the deferredresolutions of Beethoven to some sense of the incompleteness of themodern intellectual spirit, but the artist would have answered, asone of them did afterwards, 'Let them pick out the fifths and leaveus at peace.'
And so it is in poetry also: all this love of curious Frenchmetres like the Ballade, the Villanelle, the Rondel; all thisincreased value laid on elaborate alliterations, and on curiouswords and refrains, such as you will find in Dante Rossetti andSwinburne, is merely the attempt to perfect flute and viol andtrumpet through which the spirit of the age and the lips of thepoet may blow the music of their many messages.
And so it has been with this romantic movement of ours: it is areaction against the empty conventional workmanship, the laxexecution of previous poetry and painting, showing itself in thework of such men as Rossetti and Burne-Jones by a far greatersplendour of colour, a far more intricate wonder of design thanEnglish imaginative art has shown before. In Rossetti's poetry andthe poetry of Morris, Swinburne and Tennyson a perfect precisionand choice of language, a style flawless and fearless, a seekingfor all sweet and precious melodies and a sustaining consciousnessof the musical value of each word are opposed to that value whichis merely intellectual. In this respect they are one with theromantic movement of France of which not the least characteristicnote was struck by Theophile Gautier's advice to the young poet toread his dictionary every day, as being the only book worth apoet's reading.
While, then, the material of workmanship is being thus elaboratedand discovered to have in itself incommunicable and eternalqualities of its own, qualities entirely satisfying to the poeticsense and not needing for their aesthetic effect any loftyintellectual vision, any deep criticism of life or even anypassionate human emotion at all, the spirit and the method of thepoet's working - what people call his inspiration - have notescaped the controlling influence of the artistic spirit. Not thatthe imagination has lost its wings, but we have accustomedourselves to count their innumerable pulsations, to estimate theirlimitless strength, to govern their ungovernable freedom.
To the Greeks this problem of the conditions of poetic production,and the places occupied by either spontaneity or self-consciousnessin any artistic work, had a peculiar fascination. We find it inthe mysticism of Plato and in the rationalism of Aristotle. Wefind it later in the Italian Renaissance agitating the minds ofsuch men as Leonardo da Vinci. Schiller tried to adjust thebalance between form and feeling, and Goethe to estimate theposition of self-consciousness in art. Wordsworth's definition ofpoetry as 'emotion remembered in tranquillity' may be taken as ananalysis of one of the stages through which all imaginative workhas to pass; and in Keats's longing to be 'able to compose withoutthis fever' (I quote from one of his letters), his desire tosubstitute for poetic ardour 'a more thoughtful and quiet power,'we may discern the most important moment in the evolution of thatartistic life. The question made an early and strange appearancein your literature too; and I need not remind you how deeply theyoung poets of the French romantic movement were excited andstirred by Edgar Allan Poe's analysis of the workings of his ownimagination in the creating of that supreme imaginative work whichwe know by the name of THE RAVEN.
In the last century, when the intellectual and didactic element hadintruded to such an extent into the kingdom which belongs topoetry, it was against the claims of the understanding that anartist like Goethe had to protest. 'The more incomprehensible tothe understanding a poem is the better for it,' he said once,asserting the complete supremacy of the imagination in poetry as ofreason in prose. But in this century it is rather against theclaims of the emotional faculties, the claims of mere sentiment andfeeling, that the artist must react. The simple utterance of joyis not poetry any more than a mere personal cry of pain, and thereal experiences of the artist are always those which do not findtheir direct expression but are gathered up and absorbed into someartistic form which seems, from such real experiences, to be thefarthest removed and the most alien.
'The heart contains passion but the imagination alone containspoetry,' says Charles Baudelaire. This too was the lesson thatTheophile Gautier, most subtle of all modern critics, mostfascinating of all modern poets, was never tired of teaching -'Everybody is affected by a sunrise or a sunset.' The absolutedistinction of the artist is not his capacity to feel nature somuch as his power of rendering it. The entire subordination of allintellectual and emotional faculties to the vital and informingpoetic principle is the surest sign of the strength of ourRenaissance.
We have seen the artistic spirit working, first in the delightfuland technical sphere of language, the sphere of expression asopposed to subject, then controlling the imagination of the poet indealing with his subject. And now I would point out to you itsoperation in the choice of subject. The recognition of a separaterealm for the artist, a consciousness of the absolute differencebetween the world of art and the world of real fact, betweenclassic grace and absolute reality, forms not merely the essentialelement of any aesthetic charm but is the characteristic of allgreat imaginative work and of all great eras of artistic creation -of the age of Phidias as of the age of Michael Angelo, of the ageof Sophocles as of the age of Goethe.
Art never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social problems ofthe day: rather, by so doing, it more completely realises for usthat which we desire. For to most of us the real life is the lifewe do not lead, and thus, remaining more true to the essence of itsown perfection, more jealous of its own unattainable beauty, isless likely to forget form in feeling or to accept the passion ofcreation as any substitute for the beauty of the created thing.
The artist is indeed the child of his own age, but the present willnot be to him a whit more real than the past; for, like thephilosopher of the Platonic vision, the poet is the spectator ofall time and of all existence. For him no form is obsolete, nosubject out of date; rather, whatever of life and passion the worldhas known, in desert of Judaea or in Arcadian valley, by the riversof Troy or the rivers of Damascus, in the crowded and hideousstreets of a modern city or by the pleasant ways of Camelot - alllies before him like an open scroll, all is still instinct withbeautiful life. He will take of it what is salutary for his ownspirit, no more; choosing some facts and rejecting others with thecalm artistic control of one who is in possession of the secret ofbeauty.
There is indeed a poetical attitude to be adopted towards allthings, but all things are not fit subjects for poetry. Into thesecure and sacred house of Beauty the true artist will admitnothing that is harsh or disturbing, nothing that gives pain,nothing that is debatable, nothing about which men argue. He cansteep himself, if he wishes, in the discussion of all the socialproblems of his day, poor-laws and local taxation, free trade andbimetallic currency, and the like; but when he writes on thesesubjects it will be, as Milton nobly expressed it, with his lefthand, in prose and not in verse, in a pamphlet and not in a lyric.This exquisite spirit of artistic choice was not in Byron:Wordsworth had it not. In the work of both these men there is muchthat we have to reject, much that does not give us that sense ofcalm and perfect repose which should be the effect of all fine,imaginative work. But in Keats it seemed to have been incarnate,and in his lovely ODE ON A GRECIAN URN it found its most secure andfaultless expression; in the pageant of the EARTHLY PARADISE andthe knights and ladies of Burne-Jones it is the one dominant note.
It is to no avail that the Muse of Poetry be called, even by such aclarion note as Whitman's, to migrate from Greece and Ionia and toplacard REMOVED and TO LET on the rocks of the snowy Parnassus.Calliope's call is not yet closed, nor are the epics of Asia ended;the Sphinx is not yet silent, nor the fountain of Castaly dry. Forart is very life itself and knows nothing of death; she is absolutetruth and takes no care of fact; she sees (as I remember Mr.Swinburne insisting on at dinner) that Achilles is even now moreactual and real than Wellington, not merely more noble andinteresting as a type and figure but more positive and real.
Literature must rest always on a principle, and temporalconsiderations are no principle at all. For to the poet all timesand places are one; the stuff he deals with is eternal andeternally the same: no theme is inept, no past or presentpreferable. The steam whistle will not affright him nor the flutesof Arcadia weary him: for him there is but one time, the artisticmoment; but one law, the law of form; but one land, the land ofBeauty - a land removed indeed from the real world and yet moresensuous because more enduring; calm, yet with that calm whichdwells in the faces of the Greek statues, the calm which comes notfrom the rejection but from the absorption of passion, the calmwhich despair and sorrow cannot disturb but intensify only. And soit comes that he who seems to stand most remote from his age is hewho mirrors it best, because he has stripped life of what isaccidental and transitory, stripped it of that 'mist of familiaritywhich makes life obscure to us.'
Those strange, wild-eyed sibyls fixed eternally in the whirlwind ofecstasy, those mighty-limbed and Titan prophets, labouring with thesecret of the earth and the burden of mystery, that guard andglorify the chapel of Pope Sixtus at Rome - do they not tell usmore of the real spirit of the Italian Renaissance, of the dream ofSavonarola and of the sin of Borgia, than all the brawling boorsand cooking women of Dutch art can teach us of the real spirit ofthe history of Holland?
And so in our own day, also, the two most vital tendencies of thenineteenth century - the democratic and pantheistic tendency andthe tendency to value life for the sake of art - found their mostcomplete and perfect utterance in the poetry of Shelley and Keatswho, to the blind eyes of their own time, seemed to be as wanderersin the wilderness, preachers of vague or unreal things. And Iremember once, in talking to Mr. Burne-Jones about modern science,his saying to me, 'the more materialistic science becomes, the moreangels shall I paint: their wings are my protest in favour of theimmortality of the soul.'
But these are the intellectual speculations that underlie art.Where in the arts themselves are we to find that breadth of humansympathy which is the condition of all noble work; where in thearts are we to look for what Mazzini would call the social ideas asopposed to the merely personal ideas? By virtue of what claim do Idemand for the artist the love and loyalty of the men and women ofthe world? I think I can answer that.
Whatever spiritual message an artist brings to his aid is a matterfor his own soul. He may bring judgment like Michael Angelo orpeace like Angelico; he may come with mourning like the greatAthenian or with mirth like the singer of Sicily; nor is it for usto do aught but accept his teaching, knowing that we cannot smitethe bitter lips of Leopardi into laughter or burden with ourdiscontent Goethe's serene calm. But for warrant of its truth suchmessage must have the flame of eloquence in the lips that speak it,splendour and glory in the vision that is its witness, beingjustified by one thing only - the flawless beauty and perfect formof its expression: this indeed being the social idea, being themeaning of joy in art.
Not laughter where none should laugh, nor the calling of peacewhere there is no peace; not in painting the subject ever, but thepictorial charm only, the wonder of its colour, the satisfyingbeauty of its design.
You have most of you seen, probably, that great masterpiece ofRubens which hangs in the gallery of Brussels, that swift andwonderful pageant of horse and rider arrested in its most exquisiteand fiery moment when the winds are caught in crimson banner andthe air lit by the gleam of armour and the flash of plume. Well,that is joy in art, though that golden hillside be trodden by thewounded feet of Christ and it is for the death of the Son of Manthat that gorgeous cavalcade is passing.
But this restless modern intellectual spirit of ours is notreceptive enough of the sensuous element of art; and so the realinfluence of the arts is hidden from many of us: only a few,escaping from the tyranny of the soul, have learned the secret ofthose high hours when thought is not.
And this indeed is the reason of the influence which Eastern art ishaving on us in Europe, and of the fascination of all Japanesework. While the Western world has been laying on art theintolerable burden of its own intellectual doubts and the spiritualtragedy of its own sorrows, the East has always kept true to art'sprimary and pictorial conditions.
In judging of a beautiful statue the aesthetic faculty isabsolutely and completely gratified by the splendid curves of thosemarble lips that are dumb to our complaint, the noble modelling ofthose limbs that are powerless to help us. In its primary aspect apainting has no more spiritual message or meaning than an exquisitefragment of Venetian glass or a blue tile from the wall ofDamascus: it is a beautifully coloured surface, nothing more. Thechannels by which all noble imaginative work in painting shouldtouch, and do touch the soul, are not those of the truths of life,nor metaphysical truths. But that pictorial charm which does notdepend on any literary reminiscence for its effect on the one hand,nor is yet a mere result of communicable technical skill on theother, comes of a certain inventive and creative handling ofcolour. Nearly always in Dutch painting and often in the works ofGiorgione or Titian, it is entirely independent of anythingdefinitely poetical in the subject, a kind of form and choice inworkmanship which is itself entirely satisfying, and is (as theGreeks would say) an end in itself.
And so in poetry too, the real poetical quality, the joy of poetry,comes never from the subject but from an inventive handling ofrhythmical language, from what Keats called the 'sensuous life ofverse.' The element of song in the singing accompanied by theprofound joy of motion, is so sweet that, while the incompletelives of ordinary men bring no healing power with them, the thorn-crown of the poet will blossom into roses for our pleasure; for ourdelight his despair will gild its own thorns, and his pain, likeAdonis, be beautiful in its agony; and when the poet's heart breaksit will break in music.
And health in art - what is that? It has nothing to do with a sanecriticism of life. There is more health in Baudelaire than thereis in [Kingsley]. Health is the artist's recognition of thelimitations of the form in which he works. It is the honour andthe homage which he gives to the material he uses - whether it belanguage with its glories, or marble or pigment with their glories- knowing that the true brotherhood of the arts consists not intheir borrowing one another's method, but in their producing, eachof them by its own individual means, each of them by keeping itsobjective limits, the same unique artistic delight. The delight islike that given to us by music - for music is the art in which formand matter are always one, the art whose subject cannot beseparated from the method of its expression, the art which mostcompletely realises the artistic ideal, and is the condition towhich all the other arts are constantly aspiring.
And criticism - what place is that to have in our culture? Well, Ithink that the first duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue atall times, and upon all subjects: C'EST UN GRAND AVANTAGE DEN'AVOIR RIEN FAIT, MAIS IL NE FAUT PAS EN ABUSER.
It is only through the mystery of creation that one can gain anyknowledge of the quality of created things. You have listened toPATIENCE for a hundred nights and you have heard me for one only.It will make, no doubt, that satire more piquant by knowingsomething about the subject of it, but you must not judge ofaestheticism by the satire of Mr. Gilbert. As little should youjudge of the strength and splendour of sun or sea by the dust thatdances in the beam, or the bubble that breaks on the wave, as takeyour critic for any sane test of art. For the artists, like theGreek gods, are revealed only to one another, as Emerson sayssomewhere; their real value and place time only can show. In thisrespect also omnipotence is with the ages. The true criticaddresses not the artist ever but the public only. His work lieswith them. Art can never have any other claim but her ownperfection: it is for the critic to create for art the social aim,too, by teaching the people the spirit in which they are toapproach all artistic work, the love they are to give it, thelesson they are to draw from it.
All these appeals to art to set herself more in harmony with modernprogress and civilisation, and to make herself the mouthpiece forthe voice of humanity, these appeals to art 'to have a mission,'are appeals which should be made to the public. The art which hasfulfilled the conditions of beauty has fulfilled all conditions:it is for the critic to teach the people how to find in the calm ofsuch art the highest expression of their own most stormy passions.'I have no reverence,' said Keats, 'for the public, nor foranything in existence but the Eternal Being, the memory of greatmen and the principle of Beauty.'
Such then is the principle which I believe to be guiding andunderlying our English Renaissance, a Renaissance many-sided andwonderful, productive of strong ambitions and lofty personalities,yet for all its splendid achievements in poetry and in thedecorative arts and in painting, for all the increased comelinessand grace of dress, and the furniture of houses and the like, notcomplete. For there can be no great sculpture without a beautifulnational life, and the commercial spirit of England has killedthat; no great drama without a noble national life, and thecommercial spirit of England has killed that too.
It is not that the flawless serenity of marble cannot bear theburden of the modern intellectual spirit, or become instinct withthe fire of romantic passion - the tomb of Duke Lorenzo and thechapel of the Medici show us that - but it is that, as TheophileGautier used to say, the visible world is dead, LE MONDE VISIBLE ADISPARU.
Nor is it again that the novel has killed the play, as some criticswould persuade us - the romantic movement of France shows us that.The work of Balzac and of Hugo grew up side by side together; nay,more, were complementary to each other, though neither of them sawit. While all other forms of poetry may flourish in an ignobleage, the splendid individualism of the lyrist, fed by its ownpassion, and lit by its own power, may pass as a pillar of fire aswell across the desert as across places that are pleasant. It isnone the less glorious though no man follow it - nay, by thegreater sublimity of its loneliness it may be quickened intoloftier utterance and intensified into clearer song. From the meansqualor of the sordid life that limits him, the dreamer or theidyllist may soar on poesy's viewless wings, may traverse withfawn-skin and spear the moonlit heights of Cithaeron though Faunand Bassarid dance there no more. Like Keats he may wander throughthe old-world forests of Latmos, or stand like Morris on thegalley's deck with the Viking when king and galley have long sincepassed away. But the drama is the meeting-place of art and life;it deals, as Mazzini said, not merely with man, but with socialman, with man in his relation to God and to Humanity. It is theproduct of a period of great national united energy; it isimpossible without a noble public, and belongs to such ages as theage of Elizabeth in London and of Pericles at Athens; it is part ofsuch lofty moral and spiritual ardour as came to Greek after thedefeat of the Persian fleet, and to Englishman after the wreck ofthe Armada of Spain.
Shelley felt how incomplete our movement was in this respect, andhas shown in one great tragedy by what terror and pity he wouldhave purified our age; but in spite of THE CENCI the drama is oneof the artistic forms through which the genius of the England ofthis century seeks in vain to find outlet and expression. He hashad no worthy imitators.
It is rather, perhaps, to you that we should turn to complete andperfect this great movement of ours, for there is somethingHellenic in your air and world, something that has a quicker breathof the joy and power of Elizabeth's England about it than ourancient civilisation can give us. For you, at least, are young;'no hungry generations tread you down,' and the past does not wearyyou with the intolerable burden of its memories nor mock you withthe ruins of a beauty, the secret of whose creation you have lost.That very absence of tradition, which Mr. Ruskin thought would robyour rivers of their laughter and your flowers of their light, maybe rather the source of your freedom and your strength.
To speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insoucianceof the movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of thesentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside, has beendefined by one of your poets as a flawless triumph of art. It is atriumph which you above all nations may be destined to achieve.For the voices that have their dwelling in sea and mountain are notthe chosen music of Liberty only; other messages are there in thewonder of wind-swept height and the majesty of silent deep -messages that, if you will but listen to them, may yield you thesplendour of some new imagination, the marvel of some new beauty.
'I foresee,' said Goethe, 'the dawn of a new literature which allpeople may claim as their own, for all have contributed to itsfoundation.' If, then, this is so, and if the materials for acivilisation as great as that of Europe lie all around you, whatprofit, you will ask me, will all this study of our poets andpainters be to you? I might answer that the intellect can beengaged without direct didactic object on an artistic andhistorical problem; that the demand of the intellect is merely tofeel itself alive; that nothing which has ever interested men orwomen can cease to be a fit subject for culture.
I might remind you of what all Europe owes to the sorrow of asingle Florentine in exile at Verona, or to the love of Petrarch bythat little well in Southern France; nay, more, how even in thisdull, materialistic age the simple expression of an old man'ssimple life, passed away from the clamour of great cities amid thelakes and misty hills of Cumberland, has opened out for Englandtreasures of new joy compared with which the treasures of herluxury are as barren as the sea which she has made her highway, andas bitter as the fire which she would make her slave.
But I think it will bring you something besides this, somethingthat is the knowledge of real strength in art: not that you shouldimitate the works of these men; but their artistic spirit, theirartistic attitude, I think you should absorb that.
For in nations, as in individuals, if the passion for creation benot accompanied by the critical, the aesthetic faculty also, itwill be sure to waste its strength aimlessly, failing perhaps inthe artistic spirit of choice, or in the mistaking of feeling forform, or in the following of false ideals.
For the various spiritual forms of the imagination have a naturalaffinity with certain sensuous forms of art - and to discern thequalities of each art, to intensify as well its limitations as itspowers of expression, is one of the aims that culture sets beforeus. It is not an increased moral sense, an increased moralsupervision that your literature needs. Indeed, one should nevertalk of a moral or an immoral poem - poems are either well writtenor badly written, that is all. And, indeed, any element of moralsor implied reference to a standard of good or evil in art is oftena sign of a certain incompleteness of vision, often a note ofdiscord in the harmony of an imaginative creation; for all goodwork aims at a purely artistic effect. 'We must be careful,' saidGoethe, 'not to be always looking for culture merely in what isobviously moral. Everything that is great promotes civilisation assoon as we are aware of it.'
But, as in your cities so in your literature, it is a permanentcanon and standard of taste, an increased sensibility to beauty (ifI may say so) that is lacking. All noble work is not nationalmerely, but universal. The political independence of a nation mustnot be confused with any intellectual isolation. The spiritualfreedom, indeed, your own generous lives and liberal air will giveyou. From us you will learn the classical restraint of form.
For all great art is delicate art, roughness having very little todo with strength, and harshness very little to do with power. 'Theartist,' as Mr. Swinburne says, 'must be perfectly articulate.'
This limitation is for the artist perfect freedom: it is at oncethe origin and the sign of his strength. So that all the suprememasters of style - Dante, Sophocles, Shakespeare - are the suprememasters of spiritual and intellectual vision also.
Love art for its own sake, and then all things that you need willbe added to you.
This devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful things isthe test of all great civilised nations. Philosophy may teach usto bear with equanimity the misfortunes of our neighbours, andscience resolve the moral sense into a secretion of sugar, but artis what makes the life of each citizen a sacrament and not aspeculation, art is what makes the life of the whole race immortal.
For beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm. Philosophiesfall away like sand, and creeds follow one another like thewithered leaves of autumn; but what is beautiful is a joy for allseasons and a possession for all eternity.
Wars and the clash of armies and the meeting of men in battle bytrampled field or leaguered city, and the rising of nations theremust always be. But I think that art, by creating a commonintellectual atmosphere between all countries, might - if it couldnot overshadow the world with the silver wings of peace - at leastmake men such brothers that they would not go out to slay oneanother for the whim or folly of some king or minister, as they doin Europe. Fraternity would come no more with the hands of Cain,nor Liberty betray freedom with the kiss of Anarchy; for nationalhatreds are always strongest where culture is lowest.
'How could I?' said Goethe, when reproached for not writing likeKorner against the French. 'How could I, to whom barbarism andculture alone are of importance, hate a nation which is among themost cultivated of the earth, a nation to which I owe a great partof my own cultivation?'
Mighty empires, too, there must always be as long as personalambition and the spirit of the age are one, but art at least is theonly empire which a nation's enemies cannot take from her byconquest, but which is taken by submission only. The sovereigntyof Greece and Rome is not yet passed away, though the gods of theone be dead and the eagles of the other tired.
And we in our Renaissance are seeking to create a sovereignty thatwill still be England's when her yellow leopards have grown wearyof wars and the rose of her shield is crimsoned no more with theblood of battle; and you, too, absorbing into the generous heart ofa great people this pervading artistic spirit, will create foryourselves such riches as you have never yet created, though yourland be a network of railways and your cities the harbours for thegalleys of the world.
I know, indeed, that the divine natural prescience of beauty whichis the inalienable inheritance of Greek and Italian is not ourinheritance. For such an informing and presiding spirit of art toshield us from all harsh and alien influences, we of the Northernraces must turn rather to that strained self-consciousness of ourage which, as it is the key-note of all our romantic art, must bethe source of all or nearly all our culture. I mean thatintellectual curiosity of the nineteenth century which is alwayslooking for the secret of the life that still lingers round old andbygone forms of culture. It takes from each what is serviceablefor the modern spirit - from Athens its wonder without its worship,from Venice its splendour without its sin. The same spirit isalways analysing its own strength and its own weakness, countingwhat it owes to East and to West, to the olive-trees of Colonus andto the palm-trees of Lebanon, to Gethsemane and to the garden ofProserpine.
And yet the truths of art cannot be taught: they are revealedonly, revealed to natures which have made themselves receptive ofall beautiful impressions by the study and worship of all beautifulthings. And hence the enormous importance given to the decorativearts in our English Renaissance; hence all that marvel of designthat comes from the hand of Edward Burne-Jones, all that weaving oftapestry and staining of glass, that beautiful working in clay andmetal and wood which we owe to William Morris, the greatesthandicraftsman we have had in England since the fourteenth century.
So, in years to come there will be nothing in any man's house whichhas not given delight to its maker and does not give delight to itsuser. The children, like the children of Plato's perfect city,will grow up 'in a simple atmosphere of all fair things' - I quotefrom the passage in the REPUBLIC - 'a simple atmosphere of all fairthings, where beauty, which is the spirit of art, will come on eyeand ear like a fresh breath of wind that brings health from a clearupland, and insensibly and gradually draw the child's soul intoharmony with all knowledge and all wisdom, so that he will lovewhat is beautiful and good, and hate what is evil and ugly (forthey always go together) long before he knows the reason why; andthen when reason comes will kiss her on the cheek as a friend.'
That is what Plato thought decorative art could do for a nation,feeling that the secret not of philosophy merely but of allgracious existence might be externally hidden from any one whoseyouth had been passed in uncomely and vulgar surroundings, and thatthe beauty of form and colour even, as he says, in the meanestvessels of the house, will find its way into the inmost places ofthe soul and lead the boy naturally to look for that divine harmonyof spiritual life of which art was to him the material symbol andwarrant.
Prelude indeed to all knowledge and all wisdom will this love ofbeautiful things be for us; yet there are times when wisdom becomesa burden and knowledge is one with sorrow: for as every body hasits shadow so every soul has its scepticism. In such dread momentsof discord and despair where should we, of this torn and troubledage, turn our steps if not to that secure house of beauty wherethere is always a little forgetfulness, always a great joy; to thatCITTE DIVINA, as the old Italian heresy called it, the divine citywhere one can stand, though only for a brief moment, apart from thedivision and terror of the world and the choice of the world too?
This is that CONSOLATION DES ARTS which is the key-note ofGautier's poetry, the secret of modern life foreshadowed - asindeed what in our century is not? - by Goethe. You remember whathe said to the German people: 'Only have the courage,' he said,'to give yourselves up to your impressions, allow yourselves to bedelighted, moved, elevated, nay instructed, inspired for somethinggreat.' The courage to give yourselves up to your impressions:yes, that is the secret of the artistic life - for while art hasbeen defined as an escape from the tyranny of the senses, it is anescape rather from the tyranny of the soul. But only to those whoworship her above all things does she ever reveal her truetreasure: else will she be as powerless to aid you as themutilated Venus of the Louvre was before the romantic but scepticalnature of Heine.
And indeed I think it would be impossible to overrate the gain thatmight follow if we had about us only what gave pleasure to themaker of it and gives pleasure to its user, that being the simplestof all rules about decoration. One thing, at least, I think itwould do for us: there is no surer test of a great country thanhow near it stands to its own poets; but between the singers of ourday and the workers to whom they would sing there seems to be anever-widening and dividing chasm, a chasm which slander and mockerycannot traverse, but which is spanned by the luminous wings oflove.
And of such love I think that the abiding presence in our houses ofnoble imaginative work would be the surest seed and preparation. Ido not mean merely as regards that direct literary expression ofart by which, from the little red-and-black cruse of oil or wine, aGreek boy could learn of the lionlike splendour of Achilles, of thestrength of Hector and the beauty of Paris and the wonder of Helen,long before he stood and listened in crowded market-place or intheatre of marble; or by which an Italian child of the fifteenthcentury could know of the chastity of Lucrece and the death ofCamilla from carven doorway and from painted chest. For the goodwe get from art is not what we learn from it; it is what we becomethrough it. Its real influence will be in giving the mind thatenthusiasm which is the secret of Hellenism, accustoming it todemand from art all that art can do in rearranging the facts ofcommon life for us - whether it be by giving the most spiritualinterpretation of one's own moments of highest passion or the mostsensuous expression of those thoughts that are the farthest removedfrom sense; in accustoming it to love the things of the imaginationfor their own sake, and to desire beauty and grace in all things.For he who does not love art in all things does not love it at all,and he who does not need art in all things does not need it at all.
I will not dwell here on what I am sure has delighted you all inour great Gothic cathedrals. I mean how the artist of that time,handicraftsman himself in stone or glass, found the best motivesfor his art, always ready for his hand and always beautiful, in thedaily work of the artificers he saw around him - as in those lovelywindows of Chartres - where the dyer dips in the vat and the pottersits at the wheel, and the weaver stands at the loom: realmanufacturers these, workers with the hand, and entirely delightfulto look at, not like the smug and vapid shopman of our time, whoknows nothing of the web or vase he sells, except that he ischarging you double its value and thinking you a fool for buyingit. Nor can I but just note, in passing, the immense influence thedecorative work of Greece and Italy had on its artists, the oneteaching the sculptor that restraining influence of design which isthe glory of the Parthenon, the other keeping painting always trueto its primary, pictorial condition of noble colour which is thesecret of the school of Venice; for I wish rather, in this lectureat least, to dwell on the effect that decorative art has on humanlife - on its social not its purely artistic effect.
There are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, twodifferent forms of natures: men to whom the end of life is action,and men to whom the end of life is thought. As regards the latter,who seek for experience itself and not for the fruits ofexperience, who must burn always with one of the passions of thisfiery-coloured world, who find life interesting not for its secretbut for its situations, for its pulsations and not for its purpose;the passion for beauty engendered by the decorative arts will be tothem more satisfying than any political or religious enthusiasm,any enthusiasm for humanity, any ecstasy or sorrow for love. Forart comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but thehighest quality to one's moments, and for those moments' sake. Sofar for those to whom the end of life is thought. As regards theothers, who hold that life is inseparable from labour, to themshould this movement be specially dear: for, if our days arebarren without industry, industry without art is barbarism.
Hewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeedamong us. Our modern machinery has not much lightened the labourof man after all: but at least let the pitcher that stands by thewell be beautiful and surely the labour of the day will belightened: let the wood be made receptive of some lovely form,some gracious design, and there will come no longer discontent butjoy to the toiler. For what is decoration but the worker'sexpression of joy in his work? And not joy merely - that is agreat thing yet not enough - but that opportunity of expressing hisown individuality which, as it is the essence of all life, is thesource of all art. 'I have tried,' I remember William Morrissaying to me once, 'I have tried to make each of my workers anartist, and when I say an artist I mean a man.' For the workerthen, handicraftsman of whatever kind he is, art is no longer to bea purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body ofa leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his luxury, butrather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has in itsomething beautiful and noble.
And so you must seek out your workman and give him, as far aspossible, the right surroundings, for remember that the real testand virtue of a workman is not his earnestness nor his industryeven, but his power of design merely; and that 'design is not theoffspring of idle fancy: it is the studied result of accumulativeobservation and delightful habit.' All the teaching in the worldis of no avail if you do not surround your workman with happyinfluences and with beautiful things. It is impossible for him tohave right ideas about colour unless he sees the lovely colours ofNature unspoiled; impossible for him to supply beautiful incidentand action unless he sees beautiful incident and action in theworld about him.
For to cultivate sympathy you must be among living things andthinking about them, and to cultivate admiration you must be amongbeautiful things and looking at them. 'The steel of Toledo and thesilk of Genoa did but give strength to oppression and lustre topride,' as Mr. Ruskin says; let it be for you to create an art thatis made by the hands of the people for the joy of the people, toplease the hearts of the people, too; an art that will be yourexpression of your delight in life. There is nothing 'in commonlife too mean, in common things too trivial to be ennobled by yourtouch'; nothing in life that art cannot sanctify.
You have heard, I think, a few of you, of two flowers connectedwith the aesthetic movement in England, and said (I assure you,erroneously) to be the food of some aesthetic young men. Well, letme tell you that the reason we love the lily and the sunflower, inspite of what Mr. Gilbert may tell you, is not for any vegetablefashion at all. It is because these two lovely flowers are inEngland the two most perfect models of design, the most naturallyadapted for decorative art - the gaudy leonine beauty of the oneand the precious loveliness of the other giving to the artist themost entire and perfect joy. And so with you: let there be noflower in your meadows that does not wreathe its tendrils aroundyour pillows, no little leaf in your Titan forests that does notlend its form to design, no curving spray of wild rose or brierthat does not live for ever in carven arch or window or marble, nobird in your air that is not giving the iridescent wonder of itscolour, the exquisite curves of its wings in flight, to make moreprecious the preciousness of simple adornment.
We spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret oflife. Well, the secret of life is in art.
