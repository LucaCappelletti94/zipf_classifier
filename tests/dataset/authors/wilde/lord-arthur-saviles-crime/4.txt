In Venice he met his brother, Lord Surbiton, who happened to havecome over from Corfu in his yacht. The two young men spent adelightful fortnight together. In the morning they rode on theLido, or glided up and down the green canals in their long blackgondola; in the afternoon they usually entertained visitors on theyacht; and in the evening they dined at Florian's, and smokedinnumerable cigarettes on the Piazza. Yet somehow Lord Arthur wasnot happy. Every day he studied the obituary column in the Times,expecting to see a notice of Lady Clementina's death, but every dayhe was disappointed. He began to be afraid that some accident hadhappened to her, and often regretted that he had prevented hertaking the aconitine when she had been so anxious to try its effect.Sybil's letters, too, though full of love, and trust, andtenderness, were often very sad in their tone, and sometimes he usedto think that he was parted from her for ever.
After a fortnight Lord Surbiton got bored with Venice, anddetermined to run down the coast to Ravenna, as he heard that therewas some capital cock-shooting in the Pinetum. Lord Arthur at firstrefused absolutely to come, but Surbiton, of whom he was extremelyfond, finally persuaded him that if he stayed at Danieli's byhimself he would be moped to death, and on the morning of the 15ththey started, with a strong nor'-east wind blowing, and a ratherchoppy sea. The sport was excellent, and the free, open-air lifebrought the colour back to Lord Arthur's cheek, but about the 22ndhe became anxious about Lady Clementina, and, in spite of Surbiton'sremonstrances, came back to Venice by train.
As he stepped out of his gondola on to the hotel steps, theproprietor came forward to meet him with a sheaf of telegrams. LordArthur snatched them out of his hand, and tore them open.Everything had been successful. Lady Clementina had died quitesuddenly on the night of the 17th!
His first thought was for Sybil, and he sent her off a telegramannouncing his immediate return to London. He then ordered hisvalet to pack his things for the night mail, sent his gondoliersabout five times their proper fare, and ran up to his sitting-roomwith a light step and a buoyant heart. There he found three letterswaiting for him. One was from Sybil herself, full of sympathy andcondolence. The others were from his mother, and from LadyClementina's solicitor. It seemed that the old lady had dined withthe Duchess that very night, had delighted every one by her wit andesprit, but had gone home somewhat early, complaining of heartburn.In the morning she was found dead in her bed, having apparentlysuffered no pain. Sir Mathew Reid had been sent for at once, but,of course, there was nothing to be done, and she was to be buried onthe 22nd at Beauchamp Chalcote. A few days before she died she hadmade her will, and left Lord Arthur her little house in CurzonStreet, and all her furniture, personal effects, and pictures, withthe exception of her collection of miniatures, which was to go toher sister, Lady Margaret Rufford, and her amethyst necklace, whichSybil Merton was to have. The property was not of much value; butMr. Mansfield, the solicitor, was extremely anxious for Lord Arthurto return at once, if possible, as there were a great many bills tobe paid, and Lady Clementina had never kept any regular accounts.
Lord Arthur was very much touched by Lady Clementina's kindremembrance of him, and felt that Mr. Podgers had a great deal toanswer for. His love of Sybil, however, dominated every otheremotion, and the consciousness that he had done his duty gave himpeace and comfort. When he arrived at Charing Cross, he feltperfectly happy.
The Mertons received him very kindly. Sybil made him promise thathe would never again allow anything to come between them, and themarriage was fixed for the 7th June. Life seemed to him once morebright and beautiful, and all his old gladness came back to himagain.
One day, however, as he was going over the house in Curzon Street,in company with Lady Clementina's solicitor and Sybil herself,burning packages of faded letters, and turning out drawers of oddrubbish, the young girl suddenly gave a little cry of delight.
'What have you found, Sybil?' said Lord Arthur, looking up from hiswork, and smiling.
'This lovely little silver bonbonniere, Arthur. Isn't it quaint andDutch? Do give it to me! I know amethysts won't become me till Iam over eighty.'
It was the box that had held the aconitine.
Lord Arthur started, and a faint blush came into his cheek. He hadalmost entirely forgotten what he had done, and it seemed to him acurious coincidence that Sybil, for whose sake he had gone throughall that terrible anxiety, should have been the first to remind himof it.
'Of course you can have it, Sybil. I gave it to poor Lady Clemmyself.'
'Oh! thank you, Arthur; and may I have the bonbon too? I had nonotion that Lady Clementina liked sweets. I thought she was far toointellectual.'
Lord Arthur grew deadly pale, and a horrible idea crossed his mind.
'Bonbon, Sybil? What do you mean?' he said in a slow, hoarse voice.
'There is one in it, that is all. It looks quite old and dusty, andI have not the slightest intention of eating it. What is thematter, Arthur? How white you look!'
Lord Arthur rushed across the room, and seized the box. Inside itwas the amber-coloured capsule, with its poison-bubble. LadyClementina had died a natural death after all!
The shock of the discovery was almost too much for him. He flungthe capsule into the fire, and sank on the sofa with a cry ofdespair.
