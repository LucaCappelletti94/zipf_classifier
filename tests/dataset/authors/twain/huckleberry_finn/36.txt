"This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is athirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer."
He never said nothing. But he sighed, and prettysoon he stopped digging, and then for a good littlewhile I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says:
"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work. Ifwe was prisoners it would, because then we'd have asmany years as we wanted, and no hurry; and wewouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day,while they was changing watches, and so our handswouldn't get blistered, and we could keep it up rightalong, year in and year out, and do it right, and theway it ought to be done. But WE can't fool along;we got to rush; we ain't got no time to spare. If wewas to put in another night this way we'd have toknock off for a week to let our hands get well --couldn't touch a case-knife with them sooner."
"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"
"I'll tell you. It ain't right, and it ain't moral,  .and I wouldn't like it to get out; but there ain't onlyjust the one way: we got to dig him out with thepicks, and LET ON it's case-knives."
"NOW you're TALKING!" I says; "your head getsleveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer," Isays. "Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and asfor me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it,nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a water-melon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain't no waysparticular how it's done so it's done. What I want ismy nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or whatI want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick's thehandiest thing, that's the thing I'm a-going to dig thatnigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school bookout with; and I don't give a dead rat what the au-thorities thinks about it nuther."
"Well," he says, "there's excuse for picks andletting-on in a case like this; if it warn't so, I wouldn'tapprove of it, nor I wouldn't stand by and see therules broke -- because right is right, and wrong iswrong, and a body ain't got no business doing wrongwhen he ain't ignorant and knows better. It mightanswer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick, WITHOUT anyletting on, because you don't know no better; but itwouldn't for me, because I do know better. Gimmea case-knife."
He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.He flung it down, and says:
"Gimme a CASE-KNIFE."
I didn't know just what to do -- but then I thought.I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got apickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went towork, and never said a word.
He was always just that particular. Full of principle.
So then I got a shovel, and then we picked andshoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly. We stuckto it about a half an hour, which was as long as wecould stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole toshow for it. When I got up stairs I looked out at thewindow and see Tom doing his level best with thelightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands wasso sore. At last he says:
"It ain't no use, it can't be done. What youreckon I better do? Can't you think of no way?"
"Yes," I says, "but I reckon it ain't regular.Come up the stairs, and let on it's a lightning-rod."
So he done it.
Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brasscandlestick in the house, for to make some pens forJim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung aroundthe nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole threetin plates. Tom says it wasn't enough; but I saidnobody wouldn't ever see the plates that Jim throwedout, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpsonweeds under the window-hole -- then we could totethem back and he could use them over again. SoTom was satisfied. Then he says:
"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get thethings to Jim."
"Take them in through the hole," I says, "whenwe get it done."
He only just looked scornful, and said somethingabout nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, andthen he went to studying. By and by he said he hadciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't noneed to decide on any of them yet. Said we'd got topost Jim first.
That night we went down the lightning-rod a littleafter ten, and took one of the candles along, andlistened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring;so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him. Then wewhirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about twohours and a half the job was done. We crept in underJim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around andfound the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,and found him looking hearty and healthy, and thenwe woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad tosee us he most cried; and called us honey, and all thepet names he could think of; and was for having ushunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his legwith right away, and clearing out without losing anytime. But Tom he showed him how unregular itwould be, and set down and told him all about ourplans, and how we could alter them in a minute anytime there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid,because we would see he got away, SURE. So Jim hesaid it was all right, and we set there and talked overold times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of ques-tions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come inevery day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sallycome in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty toeat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tomsays:
"NOW I know how to fix it. We'll send you somethings by them."
I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one ofthe most jackass ideas I ever struck;" but he neverpaid no attention to me; went right on. It was hisway when he'd got his plans set.
So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in therope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat, thenigger that fed him, and he must be on the lookout,and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him openthem; and we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them out; and we would tiethings to aunt's apron-strings or put them in herapron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him whatthey would be and what they was for. And told himhow to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood, andall that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn'tsee no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we waswhite folks and knowed better than him; so he wassatisfied, and said he would do it all just as Tom said.
Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; sowe had a right down good sociable time; then wecrawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,with hands that looked like they'd been chawed. Tomwas in high spirits. He said it was the best fun heever had in his life, and the most intellectural; andsaid if he only could see his way to it we would keep itup all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our childrento get out; for he believed Jim would come to like itbetter and better the more he got used to it. He saidthat in that way it could be strung out to as much aseighty year, and would be the best time on record.And he said it would make us all celebrated that had ahand in it.
In the morning we went out to the woodpile andchopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, andTom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket.Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I gotNat's notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestickinto the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim's pan,and we went along with Nat to see how it would work,and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it mostmashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever any-thing could a worked better. Tom said so himself.Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece ofrock or something like that that's always getting intobread, you know; but after that he never bit intonothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three orfour places first.
And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmishlight, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging infrom under Jim's bed; and they kept on piling in tillthere was eleven of them, and there warn't hardlyroom in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgotto fasten that lean-to door! The nigger Nat he onlyjust hollered "Witches" once, and keeled over on tothe floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan likehe was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flungout a slab of Jim's meat, and the dogs went for it, andin two seconds he was out himself and back again andshut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other doortoo. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxinghim and petting him, and asking him if he'd beenimagining he saw something again. He raised up, andblinked his eyes around, and says:
"Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn'tb'lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some'n,I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks. I did,mos' sholy. Mars Sid, I FELT um -- I FELT um, sah;dey was all over me. Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht Icould git my han's on one er dem witches jis' wunst --on'y jis' wunst -- it's all I'd ast. But mos'ly I wishtdey'd lemme 'lone, I does."
Tom says:
"Well, I tell you what I think. What makes themcome here just at this runaway nigger's breakfast-time?It's because they're hungry; that's the reason. Youmake them a witch pie; that's the thing for YOU todo."
"But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make'm a witch pie? I doan' know how to make it. Ihain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'."
"Well, then, I'll have to make it myself."
"Will you do it, honey? -- Qwill you? I'll wusshupde groun' und' yo' foot, I will!"
"All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you'vebeen good to us and showed us the runaway nigger.But you got to be mighty careful. When we comearound, you turn your back; and then whatever we'veput in the pan, don't you let on you see it at all. Anddon't you look when Jim unloads the pan -- somethingmight happen, I don't know what. And above all,don't you HANDLE the witch-things."
"HANNEL 'm, Mars Sid? What IS you a-talkin''bout? I wouldn' lay de weight er my finger onum, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars, Iwouldn't."
