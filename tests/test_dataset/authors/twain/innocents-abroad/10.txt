We passed the Fourth of July on board the Quaker City, in mid-ocean. Itwas in all respects a characteristic Mediterranean day--faultlesslybeautiful. A cloudless sky; a refreshing summer wind; a radiant sunshinethat glinted cheerily from dancing wavelets instead of crested mountainsof water; a sea beneath us that was so wonderfully blue, so richly,brilliantly blue, that it overcame the dullest sensibilities with thespell of its fascination.
They even have fine sunsets on the Mediterranean--a thing that iscertainly rare in most quarters of the globe. The evening we sailed awayfrom Gibraltar, that hard-featured rock was swimming in a creamy mist sorich, so soft, so enchantingly vague and dreamy, that even the Oracle,that serene, that inspired, that overpowering humbug, scorned the dinnergong and tarried to worship!
He said: "Well, that's gorgis, ain't it! They don't have none of themthings in our parts, do they? I consider that them effects is on accountof the superior refragability, as you may say, of the sun's diramiccombination with the lymphatic forces of the perihelion of Jubiter. Whatshould you think?"
"Oh, go to bed!" Dan said that, and went away.
"Oh, yes, it's all very well to say go to bed when a man makes anargument which another man can't answer. Dan don't never stand anychance in an argument with me. And he knows it, too. What should yousay, Jack?"
"Now, Doctor, don't you come bothering around me with that dictionarybosh. I don't do you any harm, do I? Then you let me alone."
"He's gone, too. Well, them fellows have all tackled the old Oracle, asthey say, but the old man's most too many for 'em. Maybe the Poet Lariatain't satisfied with them deductions?"
The poet replied with a barbarous rhyme and went below.
"'Pears that he can't qualify, neither. Well, I didn't expect nothingout of him. I never see one of them poets yet that knowed anything.He'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest slushabout that old rock and give it to a consul, or a pilot, or a nigger, oranybody he comes across first which he can impose on. Pity butsomebody'd take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage outof him. Why can't a man put his intellect onto things that's some value?Gibbons, and Hippocratus, and Sarcophagus, and all them old ancientphilosophers was down on poets--"
"Doctor," I said, "you are going to invent authorities now and I'll leaveyou, too. I always enjoy your conversation, notwithstanding theluxuriance of your syllables, when the philosophy you offer rests on yourown responsibility; but when you begin to soar--when you begin to supportit with the evidence of authorities who are the creations of your ownfancy--I lose confidence."
That was the way to flatter the doctor. He considered it a sort ofacknowledgment on my part of a fear to argue with him. He was alwayspersecuting the passengers with abstruse propositions framed in languagethat no man could understand, and they endured the exquisite torture aminute or two and then abandoned the field. A triumph like this, overhalf a dozen antagonists was sufficient for one day; from that timeforward he would patrol the decks beaming blandly upon all comers, and sotranquilly, blissfully happy!
But I digress. The thunder of our two brave cannon announced the Fourthof July, at daylight, to all who were awake. But many of us got ourinformation at a later hour, from the almanac. All the flags were sentaloft except half a dozen that were needed to decorate portions of theship below, and in a short time the vessel assumed a holiday appearance.During the morning, meetings were held and all manner of committees setto work on the celebration ceremonies. In the afternoon the ship'scompany assembled aft, on deck, under the awnings; the flute, theasthmatic melodeon, and the consumptive clarinet crippled "TheStar-Spangled Banner," the choir chased it to cover, and George came inwith a peculiarly lacerating screech on the final note and slaughteredit. Nobody mourned.
We carried out the corpse on three cheers (that joke was not intentionaland I do not endorse it), and then the President, throned behind a cablelocker with a national flag spread over it, announced the "Reader," whorose up and read that same old Declaration of Independence which we haveall listened to so often without paying any attention to what it said;and after that the President piped the Orator of the Day to quarters andhe made that same old speech about our national greatness which we soreligiously believe and so fervently applaud. Now came the choir intocourt again, with the complaining instruments, and assaulted "HailColumbia"; and when victory hung wavering in the scale, George returnedwith his dreadful wild-goose stop turned on and the choir won, of course.A minister pronounced the benediction, and the patriotic little gatheringdisbanded. The Fourth of July was safe, as far as the Mediterranean wasconcerned.
At dinner in the evening, a well-written original poem was recited withspirit by one of the ship's captains, and thirteen regular toasts werewashed down with several baskets of champagne. The speeches were bad--execrable almost without exception. In fact, without any exception butone. Captain Duncan made a good speech; he made the only good speech ofthe evening. He said:
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:--May we all live to a green old age and beprosperous and happy. Steward, bring up another basket of champagne."
It was regarded as a very able effort.
The festivities, so to speak, closed with another of those miraculousballs on the promenade deck. We were not used to dancing on an evenkeel, though, and it was only a questionable success. But take it alltogether, it was a bright, cheerful, pleasant Fourth.
Toward nightfall the next evening, we steamed into the great artificialharbor of this noble city of Marseilles, and saw the dying sunlight gildits clustering spires and ramparts, and flood its leagues of environingverdure with a mellow radiance that touched with an added charm the whitevillas that flecked the landscape far and near.

There were no stages out, and we could not get on the pier from the ship.It was annoying. We were full of enthusiasm--we wanted to see France!Just at nightfall our party of three contracted with a waterman for theprivilege of using his boat as a bridge--its stern was at our companionladder and its bow touched the pier. We got in and the fellow backed outinto the harbor. I told him in French that all we wanted was to walkover his thwarts and step ashore, and asked him what he went away outthere for. He said he could not understand me. I repeated. Still hecould not understand. He appeared to be very ignorant of French. Thedoctor tried him, but he could not understand the doctor. I asked thisboatman to explain his conduct, which he did; and then I couldn'tunderstand him. Dan said:
"Oh, go to the pier, you old fool--that's where we want to go!"
We reasoned calmly with Dan that it was useless to speak to thisforeigner in English--that he had better let us conduct this business inthe French language and not let the stranger see how uncultivated he was.
"Well, go on, go on," he said, "don't mind me. I don't wish tointerfere. Only, if you go on telling him in your kind of French, henever will find out where we want to go to. That is what I think aboutit."
We rebuked him severely for this remark and said we never knew anignorant person yet but was prejudiced. The Frenchman spoke again, andthe doctor said:
"There now, Dan, he says he is going to allez to the douain. Means he isgoing to the hotel. Oh, certainly--we don't know the French language."
This was a crusher, as Jack would say. It silenced further criticismfrom the disaffected member. We coasted past the sharp bows of a navy ofgreat steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stonepier. It was easy to remember then that the douain was the customhouseand not the hotel. We did not mention it, however. With winning Frenchpoliteness the officers merely opened and closed our satchels, declinedto examine our passports, and sent us on our way. We stopped at thefirst cafe we came to and entered. An old woman seated us at a table andwaited for orders. The doctor said:
"Avez-vous du vin?"
The dame looked perplexed. The doctor said again, with elaboratedistinctness of articulation:
"Avez-vous du--vin!"
The dame looked more perplexed than before. I said:
"Doctor, there is a flaw in your pronunciation somewhere. Let me tryher. Madame, avez-vous du vin?--It isn't any use, Doctor--take thewitness."
"Madame, avez-vous du vin--du fromage--pain--pickled pigs' feet--beurre--des oeufs--du boeuf--horseradish, sauerkraut, hog and hominy--anything,anything in the world that can stay a Christian stomach!"
She said:
"Bless you, why didn't you speak English before? I don't know anythingabout your plagued French!"
The humiliating taunts of the disaffected member spoiled the supper, andwe dispatched it in angry silence and got away as soon as we could. Herewe were in beautiful France--in a vast stone house of quaintarchitecture--surrounded by all manner of curiously worded French signs--stared at by strangely habited, bearded French people--everythinggradually and surely forcing upon us the coveted consciousness that atlast, and beyond all question, we were in beautiful France and absorbingits nature to the forgetfulness of everything else, and coming to feelthe happy romance of the thing in all its enchanting delightfulness--andto think of this skinny veteran intruding with her vile English, at sucha moment, to blow the fair vision to the winds! It was exasperating.
We set out to find the centre of the city, inquiring the direction everynow and then. We never did succeed in making anybody understand justexactly what we wanted, and neither did we ever succeed in comprehendingjust exactly what they said in reply, but then they always pointed--theyalways did that--and we bowed politely and said, "Merci, monsieur," andso it was a blighting triumph over the disaffected member anyway. He wasrestive under these victories and often asked:
"What did that pirate say?"
"Why, he told us which way to go to find the Grand Casino."
"Yes, but what did he say?"
"Oh, it don't matter what he said--we understood him. These are educatedpeople--not like that absurd boatman."
"Well, I wish they were educated enough to tell a man a direction thatgoes some where--for we've been going around in a circle for an hour.I've passed this same old drugstore seven times."
We said it was a low, disreputable falsehood (but we knew it was not).It was plain that it would not do to pass that drugstore again, though--we might go on asking directions, but we must cease from followingfinger-pointings if we hoped to check the suspicions of the disaffectedmember.
A long walk through smooth, asphaltum-paved streets bordered by blocks ofvast new mercantile houses of cream-colored stone every house and everyblock precisely like all the other houses and all the other blocks for amile, and all brilliantly lighted--brought us at last to the principalthoroughfare. On every hand were bright colors, flashing constellationsof gas burners, gaily dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks--hurry, life, activity, cheerfulness, conversation, and laughtereverywhere! We found the Grand Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix, and wrotedown who we were, where we were born, what our occupations were, theplace we came from last, whether we were married or single, how we likedit, how old we were, where we were bound for and when we expected to getthere, and a great deal of information of similar importance--all for thebenefit of the landlord and the secret police. We hired a guide andbegan the business of sightseeing immediately. That first night onFrench soil was a stirring one. I cannot think of half the places wewent to or what we particularly saw; we had no disposition to examinecarefully into anything at all--we only wanted to glance and go--to move,keep moving! The spirit of the country was upon us. We sat down,finally, at a late hour, in the great Casino, and called for unstintedchampagne. It is so easy to be bloated aristocrats where it costsnothing of consequence! There were about five hundred people in thatdazzling place, I suppose, though the walls being papered entirely withmirrors, so to speak, one could not really tell but that there were ahundred thousand. Young, daintily dressed exquisites and young,stylishly dressed women, and also old gentlemen and old ladies, sat incouples and groups about innumerable marble-topped tables and ate fancysuppers, drank wine, and kept up a chattering din of conversation thatwas dazing to the senses. There was a stage at the far end and a largeorchestra; and every now and then actors and actresses in preposterouscomic dresses came out and sang the most extravagantly funny songs, tojudge by their absurd actions; but that audience merely suspended itschatter, stared cynically, and never once smiled, never once applauded!I had always thought that Frenchmen were ready to laugh at any thing.
