BOOK II IN COURT AND CAMP
Chapter 1 Joan Says Good-By
THE 5th of January, 1429, Joan came to me with her uncle Laxart, andsaid:
"The time is come. My Voices are not vague now, but clear, and they havetold me what to do. In two months I shall be with the Dauphin."
Her spirits were high, and her bearing martial. I caught the infectionand felt a great impulse stirring in me that was like what one feels whenhe hears the roll of the drums and the tramp of marching men.
"I believe it," I said.
"I also believe it," said Laxart. "If she had told me before, that shewas commanded of God to rescue France, I should not have believed; Ishould have let her seek the governor by her own ways and held myselfclear of meddling in the matter, not doubting she was mad. But I haveseen her stand before those nobles and might men unafraid, and say hersay; and she had not been able to do that but by the help of God. That Iknow. Therefore with all humbleness I am at her command, to do with me asshe will."
"My uncle is very good to me," Joan said. "I sent and asked him to comeand persuade my mother to let him take me home with him to tend his wife,who is not well. It is arranged, and we go at dawn to-morrow. From hishouse I shall go soon to Vaucouleurs, and wait and strive until my prayeris granted. Who were the two cavaliers who sat to your left at thegovernor's table that day?"
"One was the Sieur Jean de Novelonpont de Metz, the other the SieurBertrand de Poulengy."
"Good metal--good metal, both. I marked them for men of mine. . . . Whatis it I see in your face? Doubt?"
I was teaching myself to speak the truth to her, not trimming it orpolishing it; so I said:
"They considered you out of your head, and said so. It is true theypitied you for being in such misfortune, but still they held you to bemad."
This did not seem to trouble her in any way or wound her. She only said:
"The wise change their minds when they perceive that they have been inerror. These will. They will march with me. I shall see them presently. .. . You seem to doubt again? Do you doubt?"
"N-no. Not now. I was remembering that it was a year ago, and that theydid not belong here, but only chanced to stop a day on their journey."
"They will come again. But as to matters now in hand; I came to leavewith you some instructions. You will follow me in a few days. Order youraffairs, for you will be absent long."
"Will Jean and Pierre go with me?"
"No; they would refuse now, but presently they will come, and with themthey will bring my parents' blessing, and likewise their consent that Itake up my mission. I shall be stronger, then--stronger for that; forlack of it I am weak now." She paused a little while, and the tearsgathered in her eyes; then she went on: "I would say good-by to LittleMengette. Bring her outside the village at dawn; she must go with me alittle of the way--"
"And Haumette?"
She broke down and began to cry, saying:
"No, oh, no--she is too dear to me, I could not bear it, knowing I shouldnever look upon her face again."
Next morning I brought Mengette, and we four walked along the road in thecold dawn till the village was far behind; then the two girls said theirgood-bys, clinging about each other's neck, and pouring out their griefin loving words and tears, a pitiful sight to see. And Joan took one longlook back upon the distant village, and the Fairy Tree, and the oakforest, and the flowery plain, and the river, as if she was trying toprint these scenes on her memory so that they would abide there alwaysand not fade, for she knew she would not see them any more in this life;then she turned, and went from us, sobbing bitterly. It was her birthdayand mine. She was seventeen years old.
