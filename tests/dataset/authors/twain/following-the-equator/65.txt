In statesmanship get the formalities right, never mind about themoralities. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
FROM DIARY:
Royal Hotel. Comfortable, good table, good service of natives andMadrasis. Curious jumble of modern and ancient city and village,primitiveness and the other thing. Electric bells, but they don't ring.Asked why they didn't, the watchman in the office said he thought theymust be out of order; he thought so because some of them rang, but mostof them didn't. Wouldn't it be a good idea to put them in order? Hehesitated--like one who isn't quite sure--then conceded the point.
May 7. A bang on the door at 6. Did I want my boots cleaned? Fifteenminutes later another bang. Did we want coffee? Fifteen later, bangagain, my wife's bath ready; 15 later, my bath ready. Two other bangs;I forget what they were about. Then lots of shouting back and forth,among the servants just as in an Indian hotel.
Evening. At 4 P.M. it was unpleasantly warm. Half-hour after sunsetone needed a spring overcoat; by 8 a winter one.
Durban is a neat and clean town. One notices that without having hisattention called to it.
Rickshaws drawn by splendidly built black Zulus, so overflowing withstrength, seemingly, that it is a pleasure, not a pain, to see themsnatch a rickshaw along. They smile and laugh and show their teeth--agood-natured lot. Not allowed to drink; 2s per hour for one person; 3sfor two; 3d for a course--one person.
The chameleon in the hotel court. He is fat and indolent andcontemplative; but is business-like and capable when a fly comes about--reaches out a tongue like a teaspoon and takes him in. He gums histongue first. He is always pious, in his looks. And pious and thankfulboth, when Providence or one of us sends him a fly. He has a froggyhead, and a back like a new grave--for shape; and hands like a bird'stoes that have been frostbitten. But his eyes are his exhibitionfeature. A couple of skinny cones project from the sides of his head,with a wee shiny bead of an eye set in the apex of each; and these conesturn bodily like pivot-guns and point every-which-way, and they areindependent of each other; each has its own exclusive machinery. When Iam behind him and C. in front of him, he whirls one eye rearwards and theother forwards--which gives him a most Congressional expression (one eyeon the constituency and one on the swag); and then if something happensabove and below him he shoots out one eye upward like a telescope and theother downward--and this changes his expression, but does not improve it.
Natives must not be out after the curfew bell without a pass. In Natalthere are ten blacks to one white.
Sturdy plump creatures are the women. They comb their wool up to a peakand keep it in position by stiffening it with brown-red clay--half ofthis tower colored, denotes engagement; the whole of it colored denotesmarriage.
None but heathen Zulus on the police; Christian ones not allowed.
May 9. A drive yesterday with friends over the Berea. Very fine roadsand lofty, overlooking the whole town, the harbor, and the sea-beautifulviews. Residences all along, set in the midst of green lawns with shrubsand generally one or two intensely red outbursts of poinsettia--theflaming splotch of blinding red a stunning contrast with the world ofsurrounding green. The cactus tree--candelabrum-like; and one twistedlike gray writhing serpents. The "flat-crown" (should be flat-roof)--half a dozen naked branches full of elbows, slant upward like artificialsupports, and fling a roof of delicate foliage out in a horizontalplatform as flat as a floor; and you look up through this thin floor asthrough a green cobweb or veil. The branches are japanesich. All aboutyou is a bewildering variety of unfamiliar and beautiful trees; one sortwonderfully dense foliage and very dark green--so dark that you notice itat once, notwithstanding there are so many orange trees. The"flamboyant"--not in flower, now, but when in flower lives up to itsname, we are told. Another tree with a lovely upright tassel scatteredamong its rich greenery, red and glowing as a firecoal. Here and there agum-tree; half a dozen lofty Norfolk Island pines lifting their frondedarms skyward. Groups of tall bamboo.
Saw one bird. Not many birds here, and they have no music--and theflowers not much smell, they grow so fast.
Everything neat and trim and clean like the town. The loveliest treesand the greatest variety I have ever seen anywhere, except approachingDarjeeling. Have not heard anyone call Natal the garden of South Africa,but that is what it probably is.
It was when Bishop of Natal that Colenso raised such a storm in thereligious world. The concerns of religion are a vital matter here yet.A vigilant eye is kept upon Sunday. Museums and other dangerous resortsare not allowed to be open. You may sail on the Bay, but it is wicked toplay cricket. For a while a Sunday concert was tolerated, upon conditionthat it must be admission free and the money taken by collection. Butthe collection was alarmingly large and that stopped the matter. Theyare particular about babies. A clergyman would not bury a childaccording to the sacred rites because it had not been baptized. TheHindoo is more liberal. He burns no child under three, holding that itdoes not need purifying.
The King of the Zulus, a fine fellow of 30, was banished six years agofor a term of seven years. He is occupying Napoleon's old stand--St.Helena. The people are a little nervous about having him come back, andthey may well be, for Zulu kings have been terrible people sometimes--like Tchaka, Dingaan, and Cetewayo.
There is a large Trappist monastery two hours from Durban, over thecountry roads, and in company with Mr. Milligan and Mr. Hunter, generalmanager of the Natal government railways, who knew the heads of it, wewent out to see it.
There it all was, just as one reads about it in books and cannot believethat it is so--I mean the rough, hard work, the impossible hours, thescanty food, the coarse raiment, the Maryborough beds, the tabu of humanspeech, of social intercourse, of relaxation, of amusement, ofentertainment, of the presence of woman in the men's establishment.There it all was. It was not a dream, it was not a lie. And yet withthe fact before one's face it was still incredible. It is such asweeping suppression of human instincts, such an extinction of the man asan individual.
La Trappe must have known the human race well. The scheme which heinvented hunts out everything that a man wants and values--and withholdsit from him. Apparently there is no detail that can help make life worthliving that has not been carefully ascertained and placed out of theTrappist's reach. La Trappe must have known that there were men whowould enjoy this kind of misery, but how did he find it out?
If he had consulted you or me he would have been told that his schemelacked too many attractions; that it was impossible; that it could neverbe floated. But there in the monastery was proof that he knew the humanrace better than it knew itself. He set his foot upon every desire thata man has--yet he floated his project, and it has prospered for twohundred years, and will go on prospering forever, no doubt.
Man likes personal distinction--there in the monastery it is obliterated.He likes delicious food--there he gets beans and bread and tea, and notenough of it. He likes to lie softly--there he lies on a sand mattress,and has a pillow and a blanket, but no sheet. When he is dining, in agreat company of friends, he likes to laugh and chat--there a monk readsa holy book aloud during meals, and nobody speaks or laughs. When a manhas a hundred friends about him, evenings, he likes to have a good timeand run late--there he and the rest go silently to bed at 8; and in thedark, too; there is but a loose brown robe to discard, there are nonight-clothes to put on, a light is not needed. Man likes to lie abedlate there he gets up once or twice in the night to perform somereligious office, and gets up finally for the day at two in the morning.Man likes light work or none at all--there he labors all day in thefield, or in the blacksmith shop or the other shops devoted to themechanical trades, such as shoemaking, saddlery, carpentry, and so on.Man likes the society of girls and women--there he never has it. Helikes to have his children about him, and pet them and play with them--there he has none. He likes billiards--there is no table there. Helikes outdoor sports and indoor dramatic and musical and socialentertainments--there are none there. He likes to bet on things--I wastold that betting is forbidden there. When a man's temper is up he likesto pour it out upon somebody there this is not allowed. A man likesanimals--pets; there are none there. He likes to smoke--there he cannotdo it. He likes to read the news--no papers or magazines come there. Aman likes to know how his parents and brothers and sisters are gettingalong when he is away, and if they miss him--there he cannot know. A manlikes a pretty house, and pretty furniture, and pretty things, and prettycolors--there he has nothing but naked aridity and sombre colors. A manlikes--name it yourself: whatever it is, it is absent from that place.
From what I could learn, all that a man gets for this is merely thesaving of his soul.
It all seems strange, incredible, impossible. But La Trappe knew therace. He knew the powerful attraction of unattractiveness; he knew thatno life could be imagined, howsoever comfortless and forbidding, butsomebody would want to try it.
This parent establishment of Germans began its work fifteen years ago,strangers, poor, and unencouraged; it owns 15,000 acres of land now, andraises grain and fruit, and makes wines, and manufactures all manner ofthings, and has native apprentices in its shops, and sends them forthable to read and write, and also well equipped to earn their living bytheir trades. And this young establishment has set up eleven branches inSouth Africa, and in them they are christianizing and educating andteaching wage-yielding mechanical trades to 1,200 boys and girls.Protestant Missionary work is coldly regarded by the commercial whitecolonist all over the heathen world, as a rule, and its product isnicknamed "rice-Christians" (occupationless incapables who join thechurch for revenue only), but I think it would be difficult to pick aflaw in the work of these Catholic monks, and I believe that thedisposition to attempt it has not shown itself.
Tuesday, May 12. Transvaal politics in a confused condition. First thesentencing of the Johannesburg Reformers startled England by itsseverity; on the top of this came Kruger's exposure of the ciphercorrespondence, which showed that the invasion of the Transvaal, with thedesign of seizing that country and adding it to the British Empire, wasplanned by Cecil Rhodes and Beit--which made a revulsion in Englishfeeling, and brought out a storm against Rhodes and the Chartered Companyfor degrading British honor. For a good while I couldn't seem to get ata clear comprehension of it, it was so tangled. But at last by patientstudy I have managed it, I believe. As I understand it, the Uitlandersand other Dutchmen were dissatisfied because the English would not allowthem to take any part in the government except to pay taxes. Next, as Iunderstand it, Dr. Kruger and Dr. Jameson, not having been able to makethe medical business pay, made a raid into Matabeleland with theintention of capturing the capital, Johannesburg, and holding the womenand children to ransom until the Uitlanders and the other Boers shouldgrant to them and the Chartered Company the political rights which hadbeen withheld from them. They would have succeeded in this great scheme,as I understand it, but for the interference of Cecil Rhodes and Mr.Beit, and other Chiefs of the Matabele, who persuaded their countrymen torevolt and throw off their allegiance to Germany. This, in turn, as Iunderstand it, provoked the King of Abyssinia to destroy the Italian armyand fall back upon Johannesburg; this at the instigation of Rhodes, tobull the stock market.
