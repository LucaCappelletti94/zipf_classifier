Why the Scorners Relented
HUMAN NATURE is the same everywhere: it defies success, it has nothingbut scorn for defeat. The village considered that Joan had disgraced itwith her grotesque performance and its ridiculous failure; so all thetongues were busy with the matter, and as bilious and bitter as they werebusy; insomuch that if the tongues had been teeth she would not havesurvived her persecutions. Those persons who did not scold did what wasworse and harder to bear; for they ridiculed her, and mocked at her, andceased neither day nor night from their witticisms and jeerings andlaughter. Haumette and Little Mengette and I stood by her, but the stormwas too strong for her other friends, and they avoided her, being ashamedto be seen with her because she was so unpopular, and because of thesting of the taunts that assailed them on her account. She shed tears insecret, but none in public. In public she carried herself with serenity,and showed no distress, nor any resentment--conduct which should havesoftened the feeling against her, but it did not. Her father was soincensed that he could not talk in measured terms about her wild projectof going to the wars like a man. He had dreamed of her doing such athing, some time before, and now he remembered that dream withapprehension and anger, and said that rather than see her unsex herselfand go away with the armies, he would require her brothers to drown her;and that if they should refuse, he would do it with his own hands.
But none of these things shook her purpose in the least. Her parents kepta strict watch upon her to keep her from leaving the village, but shesaid her time was not yet; that when the time to go was come she shouldknow it, and then the keepers would watch in vain.
The summer wasted along; and when it was seen that her purpose continuedsteadfast, the parents were glad of a chance which finally offered itselffor bringing her projects to an end through marriage. The Paladin had theeffrontery to pretend that she had engaged herself to him several yearsbefore, and now he claimed a ratification of the engagement.
She said his statement was not true, and refused to marry him. She wascited to appear before the ecclesiastical court at Toul to answer for herperversity; when she declined to have counsel, and elected to conduct hercase herself, her parents and all her ill-wishers rejoiced, and lookedupon her as already defeated. And that was natural enough; for who wouldexpect that an ignorant peasant-girl of sixteen would be otherwise thanfrightened and tongue-tied when standing for the first time in presenceof the practised doctors of the law, and surrounded by the coldsolemnities of a court? Yet all these people were mistaken. They flockedto Toul to see and enjoy this fright and embarrassment and defeat, andthey had their trouble for their pains. She was modest, tranquil, andquite at her ease. She called no witnesses, saying she would contentherself with examining the witnesses for the prosecution. When they hadtestified, she rose and reviewed their testimony in a few words,pronounced it vague, confused, and of no force, then she placed thePaladin again on the stand and began to search him. His previoustestimony went rag by rag to ruin under her ingenious hands, until atlast he stood bare, so to speak, he that had come so richly clothed infraud and falsehood. His counsel began an argument, but the courtdeclined to hear it, and threw out the case, adding a few words of gravecompliment for Joan, and referring to her as "this marvelous child."
After this victory, with this high praise from so imposing a sourceadded, the fickle village turned again, and gave Joan countenance,compliment, and peace. Her mother took her back to her heart, and evenher father relented and said he was proud of her. But the time hung heavyon her hands, nevertheless, for the siege of Orleans was begun, theclouds lowered darker and darker over France, and still her Voices saidwait, and gave her no direct commands. The winter set in, and woretediously along; but at last there was a change.
