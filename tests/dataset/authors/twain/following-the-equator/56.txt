There are two times in a man's life when he should not speculate: when hecan't afford it, and when he can. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
On Monday and Tuesday at sunrise we again had fair-to-middling views ofthe stupendous mountains; then, being well cooled off and refreshed, wewere ready to chance the weather of the lower world once more.
We traveled up hill by the regular train five miles to the summit, thenchanged to a little canvas-canopied hand-car for the 35-mile descent. Itwas the size of a sleigh, it had six seats and was so low that it seemedto rest on the ground. It had no engine or other propelling power, andneeded none to help it fly down those steep inclines. It only needed astrong brake, to modify its flight, and it had that. There was a storyof a disastrous trip made down the mountain once in this little car bythe Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, when the car jumped the track andthrew its passengers over a precipice. It was not true, but the storyhad value for me, for it made me nervous, and nervousness wakes a personup and makes him alive and alert, and heightens the thrill of a new anddoubtful experience. The car could really jump the track, of course; apebble on the track, placed there by either accident or malice, at asharp curve where one might strike it before the eye could discover it,could derail the car and fling it down into India; and the fact that thelieutenant-governor had escaped was no proof that I would have the sameluck. And standing there, looking down upon the Indian Empire from theairy altitude of 7,000 feet, it seemed unpleasantly far, dangerously far,to be flung from a handcar.
But after all, there was but small danger-for me. What there was, wasfor Mr. Pugh, inspector of a division of the Indian police, in whosecompany and protection we had come from Calcutta. He had seen longservice as an artillery officer, was less nervous than I was, and so hewas to go ahead of us in a pilot hand-car, with a Ghurka and anothernative; and the plan was that when we should see his car jump over aprecipice we must put on our break [sp.] and send for another pilot.It was a good arrangement. Also Mr. Barnard, chief engineer of themountain-division of the road, was to take personal charge of our car,and he had been down the mountain in it many a time.
Everything looked safe. Indeed, there was but one questionable detailleft: the regular train was to follow us as soon as we should start, andit might run over us. Privately, I thought it would.
The road fell sharply down in front of us and went corkscrewing in andout around the crags and precipices, down, down, forever down, suggestingnothing so exactly or so uncomfortably as a croaked toboggan slide withno end to it. Mr. Pugh waved his flag and started, like an arrow from abow, and before I could get out of the car we were gone too. I hadpreviously had but one sensation like the shock of that departure, andthat was the gaspy shock that took my breath away the first time that Iwas discharged from the summit of a toboggan slide. But in bothinstances the sensation was pleasurable--intensely so; it was a suddenand immense exaltation, a mixed ecstasy of deadly fright and unimaginablejoy. I believe that this combination makes the perfection of humandelight.
The pilot car's flight down the mountain suggested the swoop of a swallowthat is skimming the ground, so swiftly and smoothly and gracefully itswept down the long straight reaches and soared in and out of the bendsand around the corners. We raced after it, and seemed to flash by thecapes and crags with the speed of light; and now and then we almostovertook it--and had hopes; but it was only playing with us; when we gotnear, it released its brake, make a spring around a corner, and the nexttime it spun into view, a few seconds later, it looked as small as awheelbarrow, it was so far away. We played with the train in the sameway. We often got out to gather flowers or sit on a precipice and lookat the scenery, then presently we would hear a dull and growing roar, andthe long coils of the train would come into sight behind and above us;but we did not need to start till the locomotive was close down upon us--then we soon left it far behind. It had to stop at every station,therefore it was not an embarrassment to us. Our brake was a good pieceof machinery; it could bring the car to a standstill on a slope as steepas a house-roof.
The scenery was grand and varied and beautiful, and there was no hurry;we could always stop and examine it. There was abundance of time. Wedid not need to hamper the train; if it wanted the road, we could switchoff and let it go by, then overtake it and pass it later. We stopped atone place to see the Gladstone Cliff, a great crag which the ages and theweather have sculptured into a recognizable portrait of the venerablestatesman. Mr. Gladstone is a stockholder in the road, and Nature beganthis portrait ten thousand years ago, with the idea of having thecompliment ready in time for the event.
We saw a banyan tree which sent down supporting stems from branches whichwere sixty feet above the ground. That is, I suppose it was a banyan;its bark resembled that of the great banyan in the botanical gardens atCalcutta, that spider-legged thing with its wilderness of vegetablecolumns. And there were frequent glimpses of a totally leafless treeupon whose innumerable twigs and branches a cloud of crimson butterflieshad lighted--apparently. In fact these brilliant red butterflies wereflowers, but the illusion was good. Afterward in South Africa, I sawanother splendid effect made by red flowers. This flower was probablycalled the torch-plant--should have been so named, anyway. It had aslender stem several feet high, and from its top stood up a single tongueof flame, an intensely red flower of the size and shape of a smallcorn-cob. The stems stood three or four feet apart all over a greathill-slope that was a mile long, and make one think of what the Placede la Concorde would be if its myriad lights were red instead of whiteand yellow.
A few miles down the mountain we stopped half an hour to see a Thibetandramatic performance. It was in the open air on the hillside. Theaudience was composed of Thibetans, Ghurkas, and other unusual people.The costumes of the actors were in the last degree outlandish, and theperformance was in keeping with the clothes. To an accompaniment ofbarbarous noises the actors stepped out one after another and began tospin around with immense swiftness and vigor and violence, chanting thewhile, and soon the whole troupe would be spinning and chanting andraising the dust. They were performing an ancient and celebratedhistorical play, and a Chinaman explained it to me in pidjin English asit went along. The play was obscure enough without the explanation; withthe explanation added, it was (opake). As a drama this ancienthistorical work of art was defective, I thought, but as a wild andbarbarous spectacle the representation was beyond criticism.Far down the mountain we got out to look at a piece of remarkableloop-engineering--a spiral where the road curves upon itself with suchabruptness that when the regular train came down and entered the loop, westood over it and saw the locomotive disappear under our bridge, then ina few moments appear again, chasing its own tail; and we saw it gain onit, overtake it, draw ahead past the rear cars, and run a race with thatend of the train. It was like a snake swallowing itself.
Half-way down the mountain we stopped about an hour at Mr. Barnard'shouse for refreshments, and while we were sitting on the veranda lookingat the distant panorama of hills through a gap in the forest, we camevery near seeing a leopard kill a calf.--[It killed it the day before.]--It is a wild place and lovely. From the woods all about came the songsof birds,--among them the contributions of a couple of birds which I wasnot then acquainted with: the brain-fever bird and the coppersmith. Thesong of the brain-fever demon starts on a low but steadily rising key,and is a spiral twist which augments in intensity and severity with eachadded spiral, growing sharper and sharper, and more and more painful,more and more agonizing, more and more maddening, intolerable,unendurable, as it bores deeper and deeper and deeper into the listener'sbrain, until at last the brain fever comes as a relief and the man dies.I am bringing some of these birds home to America. They will be a greatcuriosity there, and it is believed that in our climate they willmultiply like rabbits.
The coppersmith bird's note at a certain distance away has the ring of asledge on granite; at a certain other distance the hammering has a moremetallic ring, and you might think that the bird was mending a copperkettle; at another distance it has a more woodeny thump, but it is athump that is full of energy, and sounds just like starting a bung. Sohe is a hard bird to name with a single name; he is a stone-breaker,coppersmith, and bung-starter, and even then he is not completely named,for when he is close by you find that there is a soft, deep, melodiousquality in his thump, and for that no satisfying name occurs to you. Youwill not mind his other notes, but when he camps near enough for you tohear that one, you presently find that his measured and monotonousrepetition of it is beginning to disturb you; next it will weary you,soon it will distress you, and before long each thump will hurt yourhead; if this goes on, you will lose your mind with the pain and miseryof it, and go crazy. I am bringing some of these birds home to America.There is nothing like them there. They will be a great surprise, and itis said that in a climate like ours they will surpass expectation forfecundity.
I am bringing some nightingales, too, and some cue-owls. I got them inItaly. The song of the nightingale is the deadliest known toornithology. That demoniacal shriek can kill at thirty yards. The noteof the cue-owl is infinitely soft and sweet--soft and sweet as thewhisper of a flute. But penetrating--oh, beyond belief; it can borethrough boiler-iron. It is a lingering note, and comes in triplets, onthe one unchanging key: hoo-o-o, hoo-o-o, hoo-o-o; then a silence offifteen seconds, then the triplet again; and so on, all night. At firstit is divine; then less so; then trying; then distressing; thenexcruciating; then agonizing, and at the end of two hours the listener isa maniac.
And so, presently we took to the hand-car and went flying down themountain again; flying and stopping, flying and stopping, till at last wewere in the plain once more and stowed for Calcutta in the regular train.That was the most enjoyable day I have spent in the earth. For rousing,tingling, rapturous pleasure there is no holiday trip that approaches thebird-flight down the Himalayas in a hand-car. It has no fault, noblemish, no lack, except that there are only thirty-five miles of itinstead of five hundred.
