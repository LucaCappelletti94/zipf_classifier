We descended from Mount Tabor, crossed a deep ravine, followed a hilly,rocky road to Nazareth--distant two hours. All distances in the East aremeasured by hours, not miles. A good horse will walk three miles an hourover nearly any kind of a road; therefore, an hour, here, always standsfor three miles. This method of computation is bothersome and annoying;and until one gets thoroughly accustomed to it, it carries nointelligence to his mind until he has stopped and translated the paganhours into Christian miles, just as people do with the spoken words of aforeign language they are acquainted with, but not familiarly enough tocatch the meaning in a moment. Distances traveled by human feet are alsoestimated by hours and minutes, though I do not know what the base of thecalculation is. In Constantinople you ask, "How far is it to theConsulate?" and they answer, "About ten minutes." "How far is it to theLloyds' Agency?" "Quarter of an hour." "How far is it to the lowerbridge?" "Four minutes." I can not be positive about it, but I thinkthat there, when a man orders a pair of pantaloons, he says he wants thema quarter of a minute in the legs and nine seconds around the waist.
Two hours from Tabor to Nazareth--and as it was an uncommonly narrow,crooked trail, we necessarily met all the camel trains and jackasscaravans between Jericho and Jacksonville in that particular place andnowhere else. The donkeys do not matter so much, because they are sosmall that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal ofspirit, but a camel is not jumpable. A camel is as tall as any ordinarydwelling-house in Syria--which is to say a camel is from one to two, andsometimes nearly three feet taller than a good-sized man. In this partof the country his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacks--oneon each side. He and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage.Think of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail. The camelwould not turn out for a king. He stalks serenely along, bringing hiscushioned stilts forward with the long, regular swing of a pendulum, andwhatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably, or be wiped outforcibly by the bulky sacks. It was a tiresome ride to us, and perfectlyexhausting to the horses. We were compelled to jump over upwards ofeighteen hundred donkeys, and only one person in the party was unseatedless than sixty times by the camels. This seems like a powerfulstatement, but the poet has said, "Things are not what they seem." I cannot think of any thing, now, more certain to make one shudder, than tohave a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the earwith its cold, flabby under-lip. A camel did this for one of the boys,who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study. He glanced up and sawthe majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts toget out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulderbefore he accomplished it. This was the only pleasant incident of thejourney.
At Nazareth we camped in an olive grove near the Virgin Mary's fountain,and that wonderful Arab "guard" came to collect some bucksheesh for his"services" in following us from Tiberias and warding off invisibledangers with the terrors of his armament. The dragoman had paid hismaster, but that counted as nothing--if you hire a man to sneeze for you,here, and another man chooses to help him, you have got to pay both.They do nothing whatever without pay. How it must have surprised thesepeople to hear the way of salvation offered to them "without money andwithout price." If the manners, the people or the customs of thiscountry have changed since the Saviour's time, the figures and metaphorsof the Bible are not the evidences to prove it by.
We entered the great Latin Convent which is built over the traditionaldwelling-place of the Holy Family. We went down a flight of fifteensteps below the ground level, and stood in a small chapel tricked outwith tapestry hangings, silver lamps, and oil paintings. A spot markedby a cross, in the marble floor, under the altar, was exhibited as theplace made forever holy by the feet of the Virgin when she stood up toreceive the message of the angel. So simple, so unpretending a locality,to be the scene of so mighty an event! The very scene of theAnnunciation--an event which has been commemorated by splendid shrinesand august temples all over the civilized world, and one which theprinces of art have made it their loftiest ambition to picture worthilyon their canvas; a spot whose history is familiar to the very children ofevery house, and city, and obscure hamlet of the furthest lands ofChristendom; a spot which myriads of men would toil across the breadth ofa world to see, would consider it a priceless privilege to look upon.It was easy to think these thoughts. But it was not easy to bring myselfup to the magnitude of the situation. I could sit off several thousandmiles and imagine the angel appearing, with shadowy wings and lustrouscountenance, and note the glory that streamed downward upon the Virgin'shead while the message from the Throne of God fell upon her ears--any onecan do that, beyond the ocean, but few can do it here. I saw the littlerecess from which the angel stepped, but could not fill its void. Theangels that I know are creatures of unstable fancy--they will not fit inniches of substantial stone. Imagination labors best in distant fields.I doubt if any man can stand in the Grotto of the Annunciation and peoplewith the phantom images of his mind its too tangible walls of stone.
They showed us a broken granite pillar, depending from the roof, whichthey said was hacked in two by the Moslem conquerors of Nazareth, in thevain hope of pulling down the sanctuary. But the pillar remainedmiraculously suspended in the air, and, unsupported itself, supportedthen and still supports the roof. By dividing this statement up amongeight, it was found not difficult to believe it.
These gifted Latin monks never do any thing by halves. If they were toshow you the Brazen Serpent that was elevated in the wilderness, youcould depend upon it that they had on hand the pole it was elevated onalso, and even the hole it stood in. They have got the "Grotto" of theAnnunciation here; and just as convenient to it as one's throat is to hismouth, they have also the Virgin's Kitchen, and even her sitting-room,where she and Joseph watched the infant Saviour play with Hebrew toyseighteen hundred years ago. All under one roof, and all clean, spacious,comfortable "grottoes." It seems curious that personages intimatelyconnected with the Holy Family always lived in grottoes--in Nazareth, inBethlehem, in imperial Ephesus--and yet nobody else in their day andgeneration thought of doing any thing of the kind. If they ever did,their grottoes are all gone, and I suppose we ought to wonder at thepeculiar marvel of the preservation of these I speak of. When the Virginfled from Herod's wrath, she hid in a grotto in Bethlehem, and the sameis there to this day. The slaughter of the innocents in Bethlehem wasdone in a grotto; the Saviour was born in a grotto--both are shown topilgrims yet. It is exceedingly strange that these tremendous events allhappened in grottoes--and exceedingly fortunate, likewise, because thestrongest houses must crumble to ruin in time, but a grotto in the livingrock will last forever. It is an imposture--this grotto stuff--but it isone that all men ought to thank the Catholics for. Wherever they ferretout a lost locality made holy by some Scriptural event, they straightwaybuild a massive--almost imperishable--church there, and preserve thememory of that locality for the gratification of future generations. Ifit had been left to Protestants to do this most worthy work, we would noteven know where Jerusalem is to-day, and the man who could go and put hisfinger on Nazareth would be too wise for this world. The world owes theCatholics its good will even for the happy rascality of hewing out thesebogus grottoes in the rock; for it is infinitely more satisfactory tolook at a grotto, where people have faithfully believed for centuriesthat the Virgin once lived, than to have to imagine a dwelling-place forher somewhere, any where, nowhere, loose and at large all over this townof Nazareth. There is too large a scope of country. The imagination cannot work. There is no one particular spot to chain your eye, rivet yourinterest, and make you think. The memory of the Pilgrims can not perishwhile Plymouth Rock remains to us. The old monks are wise. They knowhow to drive a stake through a pleasant tradition that will hold it toits place forever.
We visited the places where Jesus worked for fifteen years as acarpenter, and where he attempted to teach in the synagogue and wasdriven out by a mob. Catholic chapels stand upon these sites and protectthe little fragments of the ancient walls which remain. Our pilgrimsbroke off specimens. We visited, also, a new chapel, in the midst of thetown, which is built around a boulder some twelve feet long by four feetthick; the priests discovered, a few years ago, that the disciples hadsat upon this rock to rest, once, when they had walked up from Capernaum.They hastened to preserve the relic. Relics are very good property.Travelers are expected to pay for seeing them, and they do it cheerfully.We like the idea. One's conscience can never be the worse for theknowledge that he has paid his way like a man. Our pilgrims would haveliked very well to get out their lampblack and stencil-plates and painttheir names on that rock, together with the names of the villages theyhail from in America, but the priests permit nothing of that kind.To speak the strict truth, however, our party seldom offend in that way,though we have men in the ship who never lose an opportunity to do it.Our pilgrims' chief sin is their lust for "specimens." I suppose that bythis time they know the dimensions of that rock to an inch, and itsweight to a ton; and I do not hesitate to charge that they will go backthere to-night and try to carry it off.
This "Fountain of the Virgin" is the one which tradition says Mary usedto get water from, twenty times a day, when she was a girl, and bear itaway in a jar upon her head. The water streams through faucets in theface of a wall of ancient masonry which stands removed from the houses ofthe village. The young girls of Nazareth still collect about it by thedozen and keep up a riotous laughter and sky-larking. The Nazarene girlsare homely. Some of them have large, lustrous eyes, but none of themhave pretty faces. These girls wear a single garment, usually, and it isloose, shapeless, of undecided color; it is generally out of repair, too.They wear, from crown to jaw, curious strings of old coins, after themanner of the belles of Tiberias, and brass jewelry upon their wrists andin their ears. They wear no shoes and stockings. They are the mosthuman girls we have found in the country yet, and the best natured.But there is no question that these picturesque maidens sadly lackcomeliness.
A pilgrim--the "Enthusiast"--said: "See that tall, graceful girl! look atthe Madonna-like beauty of her countenance!"
Another pilgrim came along presently and said: "Observe that tall,graceful girl; what queenly Madonna-like gracefulness of beauty is in hercountenance."
I said: "She is not tall, she is short; she is not beautiful, she ishomely; she is graceful enough, I grant, but she is rather boisterous."
The third and last pilgrim moved by, before long, and he said: "Ah, whata tall, graceful girl! what Madonna-like gracefulness of queenly beauty!"
The verdicts were all in. It was time, now, to look up the authoritiesfor all these opinions. I found this paragraph, which follows. Writtenby whom? Wm. C. Grimes: 
     "After we were in the saddle, we rode down to the spring to have a     last look at the women of Nazareth, who were, as a class, much the     prettiest that we had seen in the East.  As we approached the crowd     a tall girl of nineteen advanced toward Miriam and offered her a cup     of water.  Her movement was graceful and queenly.  We exclaimed on     the spot at the Madonna-like beauty of her countenance.  Whitely was     suddenly thirsty, and begged for water, and drank it slowly, with     his eyes over the top of the cup, fixed on her large black eyes,     which gazed on him quite as curiously as he on her.  Then Moreright     wanted water.  She gave it to him and he managed to spill it so as     to ask for another cup, and by the time she came to me she saw     through the operation; her eyes were full of fun as she looked at     me.  I laughed outright, and she joined me in as gay a shout as ever     country maiden in old Orange county.  I wished for a picture of her.     A Madonna, whose face was a portrait of that beautiful Nazareth     girl, would be a 'thing of beauty' and 'a joy forever.'"
That is the kind of gruel which has been served out from Palestine forages.  Commend me to Fennimore Cooper to find beauty in the Indians, andto Grimes to find it in the Arabs.  Arab men are often fine looking, butArab women are not.  We can all believe that the Virgin Mary wasbeautiful; it is not natural to think otherwise; but does it follow thatit is our duty to find beauty in these present women of Nazareth?
I love to quote from Grimes, because he is so dramatic.  And because heis so romantic.  And because he seems to care but little whether he tellsthe truth or not, so he scares the reader or excites his envy or hisadmiration.
He went through this peaceful land with one hand forever on his revolver,and the other on his pocket-handkerchief.  Always, when he was not on thepoint of crying over a holy place, he was on the point of killing anArab.  More surprising things happened to him in Palestine than everhappened to any traveler here or elsewhere since Munchausen died.
At Beit Jin, where nobody had interfered with him, he crept out of histent at dead of night and shot at what he took to be an Arab lying on arock, some distance away, planning evil.  The ball killed a wolf.  Justbefore he fired, he makes a dramatic picture of himself--as usual, toscare the reader:
     "Was it imagination, or did I see a moving object on the surface of     the rock?  If it were a man, why did he not now drop me?  He had a     beautiful shot as I stood out in my black boornoose against the     white tent.  I had the sensation of an entering bullet in my throat,     breast, brain."
Reckless creature!
Riding toward Genessaret, they saw two Bedouins, and "we looked to ourpistols and loosened them quietly in our shawls," etc.  Always cool.
In Samaria, he charged up a hill, in the face of a volley of stones; hefired into the crowd of men who threw them.  He says:
     "I never lost an opportunity of impressing the Arabs with the     perfection of American and English weapons, and the danger of     attacking any one of the armed Franks.  I think the lesson of that     ball not lost."
At Beit Jin he gave his whole band of Arab muleteers a piece of his mind,and then--
     "I contented myself with a solemn assurance that if there occurred     another instance of disobedience to orders I would thrash the     responsible party as he never dreamed of being thrashed, and if I     could not find who was responsible, I would whip them all, from     first to last, whether there was a governor at hand to do it or I     had to do it myself"
Perfectly fearless, this man.
He rode down the perpendicular path in the rocks, from the Castle ofBanias to the oak grove, at a flying gallop, his horse striding "thirtyfeet" at every bound.  I stand prepared to bring thirty reliablewitnesses to prove that Putnam's famous feat at Horseneck wasinsignificant compared to this.
Behold him--always theatrical--looking at Jerusalem--this time, by anoversight, with his hand off his pistol for once.
     "I stood in the road, my hand on my horse's neck, and with my dim     eyes sought to trace the outlines of the holy places which I had     long before fixed in my mind, but the fast-flowing tears forbade my     succeeding.  There were our Mohammedan servants, a Latin monk, two     Armenians and a Jew in our cortege, and all alike gazed with     overflowing eyes."
If Latin monks and Arabs cried, I know to a moral certainty that thehorses cried also, and so the picture is complete.
But when necessity demanded, he could be firm as adamant.  In the LebanonValley an Arab youth--a Christian; he is particular to explain thatMohammedans do not steal--robbed him of a paltry ten dollars' worth ofpowder and shot.  He convicted him before a sheik and looked on while hewas punished by the terrible bastinado.  Hear him:
     "He (Mousa) was on his back in a twinkling, howling, shouting,     screaming, but he was carried out to the piazza before the door,     where we could see the operation, and laid face down.  One man sat     on his back and one on his legs, the latter holding up his feet,     while a third laid on the bare soles a rhinoceros-hide koorbash     --["A Koorbash is Arabic for cowhide, the cow being a rhinoceros.     It is the most cruel whip known to fame.  Heavy as lead, and     flexible as India-rubber, usually about forty inches long and     tapering gradually from an inch in diameter to a point, it     administers a blow which leaves its mark for time."--Scow Life in     Egypt, by the same author.]--that whizzed through the air at every     stroke.  Poor Moreright was in agony, and Nama and Nama the Second     (mother and sister of Mousa,) were on their faces begging and     wailing, now embracing my knees and now Whitely's, while the     brother, outside, made the air ring with cries louder than Mousa's.     Even Yusef came and asked me on his knees to relent, and last of     all, Betuni--the rascal had lost a feed-bag in their house and had     been loudest in his denunciations that morning--besought the Howajji     to have mercy on the fellow."
But not he!  The punishment was "suspended," at the fifteenth blow tohear the confession.  Then Grimes and his party rode away, and left theentire Christian family to be fined and as severely punished as theMohammedan sheik should deem proper.
     "As I mounted, Yusef once more begged me to interfere and have mercy     on them, but I looked around at the dark faces of the crowd, and I     couldn't find one drop of pity in my heart for them."
He closes his picture with a rollicking burst of humor which contrastsfinely with the grief of the mother and her children.
One more paragraph:
     "Then once more I bowed my head.  It is no shame to have wept in     Palestine.  I wept, when I saw Jerusalem, I wept when I lay in the     starlight at Bethlehem.  I wept on the blessed shores of Galilee.     My hand was no less firm on the rein, my anger did not tremble on     the trigger of my pistol when I rode with it in my right hand along     the shore of the blue sea" (weeping.) "My eye was not dimmed by     those tears nor my heart in aught weakened.  Let him who would sneer     at my emotion close this volume here, for he will find little to his     taste in my journeyings through Holy Land."
He never bored but he struck water.
I am aware that this is a pretty voluminous notice of Mr. Grimes' book.However, it is proper and legitimate to speak of it, for "Nomadic Life inPalestine" is a representative book--the representative of a class ofPalestine books--and a criticism upon it will serve for a criticism uponthem all.  And since I am treating it in the comprehensive capacity of arepresentative book, I have taken the liberty of giving to both book andauthor fictitious names.  Perhaps it is in better taste, any how, to dothis.
