"Where's the butter?"
"I laid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of acorn-pone."
"Well, you LEFT it laid out, then -- it ain't here."
"We can get along without it," I says.
"We can get along WITH it, too," he says; "justyou slide down cellar and fetch it. And then moseyright down the lightning-rod and come along. I'll goand stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent hismother in disguise, and be ready to BA like a sheepand shove soon as you get there."
So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunkof butter, big as a person's fist, was where I had leftit, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, andblowed out my light, and started up stairs verystealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, buthere comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clappedthe truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head,and the next second she see me; and she says:
"You been down cellar?"
"Yes'm."
"What you been doing down there?"
"Noth'n."
"NOTH'N!"
"No'm."
"Well, then, what possessed you to go down therethis time of night?"
"I don't know 'm."
"You don't KNOW? Don't answer me that way.Tom, I want to know what you been DOING downthere."
"I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, Ihope to gracious if I have."
I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generlthing she would; but I s'pose there was so manystrange things going on she was just in a sweat aboutevery little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so shesays, very decided:
"You just march into that setting-room and staythere till I come. You been up to something you nobusiness to, and I lay I'll find out what it is before I'Mdone with you."
So she went away as I opened the door and walkedinto the setting-room. My, but there was a crowdthere! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had agun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chairand set down. They was setting around, some of themtalking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgetyand uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't; but Iknowed they was, because they was always taking offtheir hats, and putting them on, and scratching theirheads, and changing their seats, and fumbling withtheir buttons. I warn't easy myself, but I didn't takemy hat off, all the same.
I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get donewith me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me getaway and tell Tom how we'd overdone this thing, andwhat a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselvesinto, so we could stop fooling around straight off, andclear out with Jim before these rips got out of patienceand come for us.
At last she come and begun to ask me questions,but I COULDN'T answer them straight, I didn't knowwhich end of me was up; because these men was insuch a fidget now that some was wanting to start rightNOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn'tbut a few minutes to midnight; and others was tryingto get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal;and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions,and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down inmy tracks I was that scared; and the place gettinghotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt andrun down my neck and behind my ears; and prettysoon, when one of them says, "I'M for going andgetting in the cabin FIRST and right NOW, and catchingthem when they come," I most dropped; and a streakof butter come a-trickling down my forehead, andAunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, andsays:
"For the land's sake, what IS the matter with thechild? He's got the brain-fever as shore as you'reborn, and they're oozing out!"
And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off myhat, and out comes the bread and what was left of thebutter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me, andsays:
"Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how gladand grateful I am it ain't no worse; for luck's againstus, and it never rains but it pours, and when I see thattruck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by thecolor and all it was just like your brains would be if --Dear, dear, whyd'nt you TELL me that was what you'dbeen down there for, I wouldn't a cared. Now clerout to bed, and don't lemme see no more of you tillmorning!"
I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one, and shinning through the dark forthe lean-to. I couldn't hardly get my words out, Iwas so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I couldwe must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose --the house full of men, yonder, with guns!
His eyes just blazed; and he says:
"No! -- is that so? AIN'T it bully! Why, Huck,if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hun-dred! If we could put it off till --"
"Hurry! HURRY!" I says. "Where's Jim?"
"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your armyou can touch him. He's dressed, and everything'sready. Now we'll slide out and give the sheep-signal."
But then we heard the tramp of men coming to thedoor, and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:
"I TOLD you we'd be too soon; they haven't come-- the door is locked. Here, I'll lock some of youinto the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill'em when they come; and the rest scatter around apiece, and listen if you can hear 'em coming."
So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, andmost trod on us whilst we was hustling to get underthe bed. But we got under all right, and out throughthe hole, swift but soft -- Jim first, me next, and Tomlast, which was according to Tom's orders. Now wewas in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by out-side. So we crept to the door, and Tom stopped usthere and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't makeout nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and saidhe would listen for the steps to get further, and whenhe nudged us Jim must glide out first, and him last.So he set his ear to the crack and listened, andlistened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping aroundout there all the time; and at last he nudged us, andwe slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and notmaking the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards thefence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me andJim over it; but Tom's britches catched fast on a splinteron the top rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so hehad to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and madea noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and startedsomebody sings out:
"Who's that? Answer, or I'll shoot!"
But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heelsand shoved. Then there was a rush, and a BANG, BANG,BANG! and the bullets fairly whizzed around us! Weheard them sing out:
"Here they are! They've broke for the river!After 'em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!"
So here they come, full tilt. We could hear thembecause they wore boots and yelled, but we didn't wearno boots and didn't yell. We was in the path to themill; and when they got pretty close on to us wedodged into the bush and let them go by, and thendropped in behind them. They'd had all the dogsshut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers; butby this time somebody had let them loose, and herethey come, making powwow enough for a million; butthey was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks tillthey catched up; and when they see it warn't nobodybut us, and no excitement to offer them, they only justsaid howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shoutingand clattering; and then we up-steam again, andwhizzed along after them till we was nearly to themill, and then struck up through the bush to wheremy canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dearlife towards the middle of the river, but didn't makeno more noise than we was obleeged to. Then westruck out, easy and comfortable, for the island wheremy raft was; and we could hear them yelling andbarking at each other all up and down the bank, till wewas so far away the sounds got dim and died out.And when we stepped on to the raft I says:
"NOW, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I betyou won't ever be a slave no more."
"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It 'uzplanned beautiful, en it 'uz done beautiful; en deyain't NOBODY kin git up a plan dat's mo' mixed-up ensplendid den what dat one wuz."
We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was thegladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf ofhis leg.
When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brashas what we did before. It was hurting him consider-able, and bleeding; so we laid him in the wigwam andtore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him,but he says:
"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don't stopnow; don't fool around here, and the evasion boomingalong so handsome; man the sweeps, and set herloose! Boys, we done it elegant! -- 'deed we did. Iwish WE'D a had the handling of Louis XVI., therewouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis, ascend toheaven!' wrote down in HIS biography; no, sir, we'da whooped him over the BORDER -- that's what we'd adone with HIM -- and done it just as slick as nothingat all, too. Man the sweeps -- man the sweeps!"
But me and Jim was consulting -- and thinking.And after we'd thought a minute, I says:
"Say it, Jim."
So he says:
"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Efit wuz HIM dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boyswuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on en save me,nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?' Is datlike Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You BEThe wouldn't! WELL, den, is JIM gywne to say it?No, sah -- I doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'douta DOCTOR, not if it's forty year!"
I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'dsay what he did say -- so it was all right now, and Itold Tom I was a-going for a doctor. He raised con-siderable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it andwouldn't budge; so he was for crawling out and set-ting the raft loose himself; but we wouldn't let him.Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn't dono good.
So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, hesays:
"Well, then, if you re bound to go, I'll tell you theway to do when you get to the village. Shut the doorand blindfold the doctor tight and fast, and make himswear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full ofgold in his hand, and then take and lead him all aroundthe back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and thenfetch him here in the canoe, in a roundabout wayamongst the islands, and search him and take his chalkaway from him, and don't give it back to him tillyou get him back to the village, or else he will chalkthis raft so he can find it again. It's the way theyall do."
So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide inthe woods when he see the doctor coming till he wasgone again.
