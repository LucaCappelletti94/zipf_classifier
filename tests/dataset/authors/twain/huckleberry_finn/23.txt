Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows tothe people, and says the great tragedy will be per-formed only two nights more, on accounts of pressingLondon engagements, where the seats is all sold alreadyfor it in Drury Lane; and then he makes them anotherbow, and says if he has succeeded in pleasing themand instructing them, he will be deeply obleeged ifthey will mention it to their friends and get them tocome and see it.
Twenty people sings out:
"What, is it over? Is that ALL?"
The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time.Everybody sings out, "Sold!" and rose up mad, andwas a-going for that stage and them tragedians. But abig, fine looking man jumps up on a bench andshouts:
"Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen." They stoppedto listen. "We are sold -- mighty badly sold. Butwe don't want to be the laughing stock of this wholetown, I reckon, and never hear the last of this thing aslong as we live. NO. What we want is to go out ofhere quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the REST ofthe town! Then we'll all be in the same boat. Ain'tthat sensible?" ("You bet it is! -- the jedge isright!" everybody sings out.) "All right, then --not a word about any sell. Go along home, and ad-vise everybody to come and see the tragedy."
Next day you couldn't hear nothing around thattown but how splendid that show was. House wasjammed again that night, and we sold this crowd thesame way. When me and the king and the duke gothome to the raft we all had a supper; and by and by,about midnight, they made Jim and me back her outand float her down the middle of the river, and fetchher in and hide her about two mile below town.
The third night the house was crammed again -- andthey warn't new-comers this time, but people that wasat the show the other two nights. I stood by the dukeat the door, and I see that every man that went in hadhis pockets bulging, or something muffled up underhis coat -- and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither,not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel,and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I knowthe signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet I do,there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved inthere for a minute, but it was too various for me; Icouldn't stand it. Well, when the place couldn't holdno more people the duke he give a fellow a quarterand told him to tend door for him a minute, and thenhe started around for the stage door, I after him; butthe minute we turned the corner and was in the darkhe says:
"Walk fast now till you get away from the houses,and then shin for the raft like the dickens was afteryou!"
I done it, and he done the same. We struck theraft at the same time, and in less than two seconds wewas gliding down stream, all dark and still, and edgingtowards the middle of the river, nobody saying a word.I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of itwith the audience, but nothing of the sort; prettysoon he crawls out from under the wigwam, and says:
"Well, how'd the old thing pan out this time,duke?" He hadn't been up-town at all.
We never showed a light till we was about ten milebelow the village. Then we lit up and had a supper,and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bonesloose over the way they'd served them people. Theduke says:
"Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first housewould keep mum and let the rest of the town get ropedin; and I knew they'd lay for us the third night, andconsider it was THEIR turn now. Well, it IS their turn,and I'd give something to know how much they'd takefor it. I WOULD just like to know how they're puttingin their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic ifthey want to -- they brought plenty provisions."
Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights. I never see moneyhauled in by the wagon-load like that before.By and by, when they was asleep and snoring, Jimsays:
"Don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on,Huck?"
"No," I says, "it don't."
"Why don't it, Huck?"
"Well, it don't, because it's in the breed. I reckonthey're all alike,"
"But, Huck, dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscal-lions; dat's jist what dey is; dey's reglar rapscallions."
"Well, that's what I'm a-saying; all kings ismostly rapscallions, as fur as I can make out."
"Is dat so?"
"You read about them once -- you'll see. Lookat Henry the Eight; this 'n 's a Sunday-school Super-intendent to HIM. And look at Charles Second, andLouis Fourteen, and Louis Fifteen, and James Second,and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and fortymore; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that usedto rip around so in old times and raise Cain. My,you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he wasin bloom. He WAS a blossom. He used to marry anew wife every day, and chop off her head next morn-ing. And he would do it just as indifferent as if hewas ordering up eggs. 'Fetch up Nell Gwynn,' hesays. They fetch her up. Next morning, 'Chop offher head!' And they chop it off. 'Fetch up JaneShore,' he says; and up she comes, Next morning,'Chop off her head' -- and they chop it off. 'Ringup Fair Rosamun.' Fair Rosamun answers the bell.Next morning, 'Chop off her head.' And he madeevery one of them tell him a tale every night; and hekept that up till he had hogged a thousand and onetales that way, and then he put them all in a book,and called it Domesday Book -- which was a goodname and stated the case. You don't know kings,Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is oneof the cleanest I've struck in history. Well, Henryhe takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble withthis country. How does he go at it -- give notice? --give the country a show? No. All of a sudden heheaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard, andwhacks out a declaration of independence, and daresthem to come on. That was HIS style -- he never giveanybody a chance. He had suspicions of his father,the Duke of Wellington. Well, what did he do? Askhim to show up? No -- drownded him in a butt ofmamsey, like a cat. S'pose people left money layingaround where he was -- what did he do? He collaredit. S'pose he contracted to do a thing, and you paidhim, and didn't set down there and see that he doneit -- what did he do? He always done the other thing.S'pose he opened his mouth -- what then? If hedidn't shut it up powerful quick he'd lose a lie everytime. That's the kind of a bug Henry was; and ifwe'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooledthat town a heap worse than ourn done. I don't saythat ourn is lambs, because they ain't, when you comeright down to the cold facts; but they ain't nothing toTHAT old ram, anyway. All I say is, kings is kings,and you got to make allowances. Take them allaround, they're a mighty ornery lot. It's the waythey're raised."
"But dis one do SMELL so like de nation, Huck."
"Well, they all do, Jim. We can't help the way aking smells; history don't tell no way."
"Now de duke, he's a tolerble likely man in someways."
"Yes, a duke's different. But not very different.This one's a middling hard lot for a duke. Whenhe's drunk there ain't no near-sighted man could tellhim from a king."
"Well, anyways, I doan' hanker for no mo' un um,Huck. Dese is all I kin stan'."
"It's the way I feel, too, Jim. But we've got themon our hands, and we got to remember what they are,and make allowances. Sometimes I wish we couldhear of a country that's out of kings."
What was the use to tell Jim these warn't real kingsand dukes? It wouldn't a done no good; and, be-sides, it was just as I said: you couldn't tell them fromthe real kind.
I went to sleep, and Jim didn't call me when it wasmy turn. He often done that. When I waked upjust at daybreak he was sitting there with his headdown betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning tohimself. I didn't take notice nor let on. I knowedwhat it was about. He was thinking about his wifeand his children, away up yonder, and he was low andhomesick; because he hadn't ever been away fromhome before in his life; and I do believe he cared justas much for his people as white folks does for their'n.It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so. He wasoften moaning and mourning that way nights, whenhe judged I was asleep, and saying, "Po' little 'Liza-beth! po' little Johnny! it's mighty hard; I spec' Iain't ever gwyne to see you no mo', no mo'!" Hewas a mighty good nigger, Jim was.
But this time I somehow got to talking to him abouthis wife and young ones; and by and by he says:
"What makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase Ihear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack, era slam, while ago, en it mine me er de time I treat mylittle 'Lizabeth so ornery. She warn't on'y 'bout fo'year ole, en she tuck de sk'yarlet fever, en had apowful rough spell; but she got well, en one day shewas a-stannin' aroun', en I says to her, I says:
"'Shet de do'.'
"She never done it; jis' stood dah, kiner smilin' upat me. It make me mad; en I says agin, mighty loud,I says:
"'Doan' you hear me? Shet de do'!'
"She jis stood de same way, kiner smilin' up. Iwas a-bilin'! I says:
"'I lay I MAKE you mine!'
"En wid dat I fetch' her a slap side de head datsont her a-sprawlin'. Den I went into de yutherroom, en 'uz gone 'bout ten minutes; en when Icome back dah was dat do' a-stannin' open YIT, endat chile stannin' mos' right in it, a-lookin' down andmournin', en de tears runnin' down. My, but I WUZmad! I was a-gwyne for de chile, but jis' den -- itwas a do' dat open innerds -- jis' den, 'long come dewind en slam it to, behine de chile, ker-BLAM! -- en mylan', de chile never move'! My breff mos' hop outerme; en I feel so -- so -- I doan' know HOW I feel. Icrope out, all a-tremblin', en crope aroun' en open dedo' easy en slow, en poke my head in behine de chile,sof' en still, en all uv a sudden I says POW! jis' asloud as I could yell. SHE NEVER BUDGE! Oh, Huck, Ibust out a-cryin' en grab her up in my arms, en say,'Oh, de po' little thing! De Lord God Amightyfogive po' ole Jim, kaze he never gwyne to fogive his-self as long's he live!' Oh, she was plumb deef endumb, Huck, plumb deef en dumb -- en I'd ben a-treat'n her so!"
