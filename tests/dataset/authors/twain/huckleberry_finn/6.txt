He got to hanging around the widow's too muchand so she told him at last that if he didn't quit usingaround there she would make trouble for him. Well,WASN'T he mad? He said he would show who wasHuck Finn's boss. So he watched out for me one dayin the spring, and catched me, and took me up theriver about three mile in a skiff, and crossed over tothe Illinois shore where it was woody and there warn'tno houses but an old log hut in a place where thetimber was so thick you couldn't find it if you didn'tknow where it was.
He kept me with him all the time, and I never got achance to run off. We lived in that old cabin, and healways locked the door and put the key under his headnights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,and we fished and hunted, and that was what we livedon. Every little while he locked me in and went downto the store, three miles, to the ferry, and traded fishand game for whisky, and fetched it home and gotdrunk and had a good time, and licked me. Thewidow she found out where I was by and by, and shesent a man over to try to get hold of me; but papdrove him off with the gun, and it warn't long afterthat till I was used to being where I was, and likedit -- all but the cowhide part.
It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortableall day, smoking and fishing, and no books nor study.Two months or more run along, and my clothes got tobe all rags and dirt, and I didn't see how I'd ever gotto like it so well at the widow's, where you had towash, and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bedand get up regular, and be forever bothering over abook, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all thetime. I didn't want to go back no more. I hadstopped cussing, because the widow didn't like it; butnow I took to it again because pap hadn't no objec-tions. It was pretty good times up in the woodsthere, take it all around.
But by and by pap got too handy with his hick'ry,and I couldn't stand it. I was all over welts. He gotto going away so much, too, and locking me in. Oncehe locked me in and was gone three days. It wasdreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drowned,and I wasn't ever going to get out any more. I wasscared. I made up my mind I would fix up some wayto leave there. I had tried to get out of that cabinmany a time, but I couldn't find no way. Therewarn't a window to it big enough for a dog to getthrough. I couldn't get up the chimbly; it was toonarrow. The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Papwas pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything inthe cabin when he was away; I reckon I had huntedthe place over as much as a hundred times; well, Iwas most all the time at it, because it was about theonly way to put in the time. But this time I foundsomething at last; I found an old rusty wood-sawwithout any handle; it was laid in between a rafterand the clapboards of the roof. I greased it up andwent to work. There was an old horse-blanket nailedagainst the logs at the far end of the cabin behind thetable, to keep the wind from blowing through thechinks and putting the candle out. I got under thetable and raised the blanket, and went to work to sawa section of the big bottom log out -- big enough tolet me through. Well, it was a good long job, but Iwas getting towards the end of it when I heard pap'sgun in the woods. I got rid of the signs of my work,and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and prettysoon pap come in.
Pap warn't in a good humor -- so he was his naturalself. He said he was down town, and everything wasgoing wrong. His lawyer said he reckoned he wouldwin his lawsuit and get the money if they ever gotstarted on the trial; but then there was ways to put itoff a long time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to doit And he said people allowed there'd be anothertrial to get me away from him and give me to thewidow for my guardian, and they guessed it would winthis time. This shook me up considerable, because Ididn't want to go back to the widow's any more andbe so cramped up and sivilized, as they called it.Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed every-thing and everybody he could think of, and then cussedthem all over again to make sure he hadn't skippedany, and after that he polished off with a kind of ageneral cuss all round, including a considerable parcelof people which he didn't know the names of, and socalled them what's-his-name when he got to them, andwent right along with his cussing.
He said he would like to see the widow get me.He said he would watch out, and if they tried to comeany such game on him he knowed of a place six orseven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunttill they dropped and they couldn't find me. Thatmade me pretty uneasy again, but only for a minute;I reckoned I wouldn't stay on hand till he got thatchance.
The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch thethings he had got. There was a fifty-pound sack ofcorn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and afour-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and twonewspapers for wadding, besides some tow. I totedup a load, and went back and set down on the bow ofthe skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I reckonedI would walk off with the gun and some lines, and taketo the woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn'tstay in one place, but just tramp right across thecountry, mostly night times, and hunt and fish to keepalive, and so get so far away that the old man nor thewidow couldn't ever find me any more. I judged Iwould saw out and leave that night if pap got drunkenough, and I reckoned he would. I got so full of itI didn't notice how long I was staying till the old manhollered and asked me whether I was asleep ordrownded.
I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it wasabout dark. While I was cooking supper the old mantook a swig or two and got sort of warmed up, andwent to ripping again. He had been drunk over intown, and laid in the gutter all night, and he was asight to look at. A body would a thought he wasAdam -- he was just all mud. Whenever his liquorbegun to work he most always went for the govment.his time he says:
"Call this a govment! why, just look at it and seewhat it's like. Here's the law a-standing ready to takea man's son away from him -- a man's own son, whichhe has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and allthe expense of raising. Yes, just as that man has gotthat son raised at last, and ready to go to work andbegin to do suthin' for HIM and give him a rest, the lawup and goes for him. And they call THAT govment!That ain't all, nuther. The law backs that old JudgeThatcher up and helps him to keep me out o' myproperty. Here's what the law does: The law takes aman worth six thousand dollars and up'ards, and jamshim into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets himgo round in clothes that ain't fitten for a hog. Theycall that govment! A man can't get his rights in agovment like this. Sometimes I've a mighty notion tojust leave the country for good and all. Yes, and ITOLD 'em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lotsof 'em heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I,for two cents I'd leave the blamed country and nevercome a-near it agin. Them's the very words. I sayslook at my hat -- if you call it a hat -- but the lidraises up and the rest of it goes down till it's belowmy chin, and then it ain't rightly a hat at all, but morelike my head was shoved up through a jint o' stove-pipe. Look at it, says I -- such a hat for me to wear-- one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could gitmy rights.
"Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful.Why, looky here. There was a free nigger there fromOhio -- a mulatter, most as white as a white man. Hehad the whitest shirt on you ever see, too, and theshiniest hat; and there ain't a man in that town that'sgot as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a goldwatch and chain, and a silver-headed cane -- the awful-est old gray-headed nabob in the State. And what doyou think? They said he was a p'fessor in a college,and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowedeverything. And that ain't the wust. They said hecould VOTE when he was at home. Well, that let meout. Thinks I, what is the country a-coming to? Itwas 'lection day, and I was just about to go and votemyself if I warn't too drunk to get there; but whenthey told me there was a State in this country wherethey'd let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I'llnever vote agin. Them's the very words I said; theyall heard me; and the country may rot for all me --I'll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see thecool way of that nigger -- why, he wouldn't a give methe road if I hadn't shoved him out o' the way. Isays to the people, why ain't this nigger put up atauction and sold? -- that's what I want to know. Andwhat do you reckon they said? Why, they said hecouldn't be sold till he'd been in the State six months,and he hadn't been there that long yet. There, now --that's a specimen. They call that a govment that can'tsell a free nigger till he's been in the State six months.Here's a govment that calls itself a govment, and letson to be a govment, and thinks it is a govment, andyet's got to set stock-still for six whole months beforeit can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal,white-shirted free nigger, and --"
Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where hisold limber legs was taking him to, so he went head overheels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins,and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind oflanguage -- mostly hove at the nigger and the gov-ment, though he give the tub some, too, all along,here and there. He hopped around the cabin con-siderable, first on one leg and then on the other, hold-ing first one shin and then the other one, and at last helet out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetchedthe tub a rattling kick. But it warn't good judgment,because that was the boot that had a couple of his toesleaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised ahowl that fairly made a body's hair raise, and down hewent in the dirt, and rolled there, and held his toes;and the cussing he done then laid over anything hehad ever done previous. He said so his own self after-wards. He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in hisbest days, and he said it laid over him, too; but Ireckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.
After supper pap took the jug, and said he hadenough whisky there for two drunks and one deliriumtremens. That was always his word. I judged hewould be blind drunk in about an hour, and then Iwould steal the key, or saw myself out, one or t'other.He drank and drank, and tumbled down on hisblankets by and by; but luck didn't run my way. Hedidn't go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He groanedand moaned and thrashed around this way and that fora long time. At last I got so sleepy I couldn't keepmy eyes open all I could do, and so before I knowedwhat I was about I was sound asleep, and the candleburning.
I don't know how long I was asleep, but all of asudden there was an awful scream and I was up.There was pap looking wild, and skipping around everywhich way and yelling about snakes. He said theywas crawling up his legs; and then he would give ajump and scream, and say one had bit him on thecheek -- but I couldn't see no snakes. He startedand run round and round the cabin, hollering "Takehim off! take him off! he's biting me on the neck!"I never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Prettysoon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting;then he rolled over and over wonderful fast, kickingthings every which way, and striking and grabbing atthe air with his hands, and screaming and saying therewas devils a-hold of him. He wore out by and by,and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid stiller,and didn't make a sound. I could hear the owls andthe wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terri-ble still. He was laying over by the corner. By andby he raised up part way and listened, with his headto one side. He says, very low:
"Tramp -- tramp -- tramp; that's the dead; tramp-- tramp -- tramp; they're coming after me; but Iwon't go. Oh, they're here! don't touch me -- don't!hands off -- they're cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devilalone!"
Then he went down on all fours and crawled off,begging them to let him alone, and he rolled himselfup in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pinetable, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. Icould hear him through the blanket.
By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feetlooking wild, and he see me and went for me. Hechased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying hewould kill me, and then I couldn't come for him nomore. I begged, and told him I was only Huck; buthe laughed SUCH a screechy laugh, and roared andcussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when Iturned short and dodged under his arm he made agrab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders,and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the jacketquick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon hewas all tired out, and dropped down with his backagainst the door, and said he would rest a minute andthen kill me. He put his knife under him, and saidhe would sleep and get strong, and then he would seewho was who.
So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got theold split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could,not to make any noise, and got down the gun. Islipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointingtowards pap, and set down behind it to wait for him tostir. And how slow and still the time did drag along.
