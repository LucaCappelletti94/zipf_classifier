=======================
Zipf Binary classifier
=======================

What is this?
==============
This is a binary classifier (meaning it can separate documents in two classes) based on the `Zipf Distribution <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law>`_ using another python package of mine `zipf <https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/zipf>`_, converting a text into its frequency representation and then measuring its average distance from a set of zipf of class A and B, using the metrics implemented in yet another package authored by myself `dictances <https://github.com/LucaCappelletti94/dictances>`_.

How does it work?

How to I get it?
