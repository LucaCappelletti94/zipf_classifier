First they done a lecture on temperance; but theydidn't make enough for them both to get drunk on.Then in another village they started a dancing-school;but they didn't know no more how to dance than akangaroo does; so the first prance they made thegeneral public jumped in and pranced them out oftown. Another time they tried to go at yellocution;but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got upand give them a solid good cussing, and made themskip out. They tackled missionarying, and mesmeriz-ing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little ofeverything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck.So at last they got just about dead broke, and laidaround the raft as she floated along, thinking andthinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a dayat a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.
And at last they took a change and begun to laytheir heads together in the wigwam and talk low andconfidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and megot uneasy. We didn't like the look of it. We judgedthey was studying up some kind of worse deviltry thanever. We turned it over and over, and at last we madeup our minds they was going to break into somebody'shouse or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was prettyscared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn'thave nothing in the world to do with such actions, andif we ever got the least show we would give them thecold shake and clear out and leave them behind.Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good,safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabbyvillage named Pikesville, and the king he went ashoreand told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to townand smelt around to see if anybody had got any windof the Royal Nonesuch there yet. ("House to rob,you MEAN," says I to myself; "and when you getthrough robbing it you'll come back here and wonderwhat has become of me and Jim and the raft -- andyou'll have to take it out in wondering.") And hesaid if he warn't back by midday the duke and mewould know it was all right, and we was to come along.
So we stayed where we was. The duke he frettedand sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way.He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't seem todo nothing right; he found fault with every littlething. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was goodand glad when midday come and no king; we couldhave a change, anyway -- and maybe a chance for THEchance on top of it. So me and the duke went up tothe village, and hunted around there for the king, andby and by we found him in the back room of a littlelow doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyrag-ging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threateningwith all his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, andcouldn't do nothing to them. The duke he begun toabuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sassback, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out andshook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun downthe river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and Imade up my mind that it would be a long day beforethey ever see me and Jim again. I got down there allout of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:
"Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"
But there warn't no answer, and nobody come outof the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout --and then another -- and then another one; and runthis way and that in the woods, whooping and screech-ing; but it warn't no use -- old Jim was gone. ThenI set down and cried; I couldn't help it. But Icouldn't set still long. Pretty soon I went out on theroad, trying to think what I better do, and I run acrossa boy walking, and asked him if he'd seen a strangenigger dressed so and so, and he says:
"Yes."
"Whereabouts?" says I.
"Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile belowhere. He's a runaway nigger, and they've got him.Was you looking for him?"
"You bet I ain't! I run across him in the woodsabout an hour or two ago, and he said if I holleredhe'd cut my livers out -- and told me to lay down andstay where I was; and I done it. Been there eversince; afeard to come out."
"Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more,becuz they've got him. He run off f'm down South,som'ers."
"It's a good job they got him."
"Well, I RECKON! There's two hunderd dollars re-ward on him. It's like picking up money out'n theroad."
"Yes, it is -- and I could a had it if I'd been bigenough; I see him FIRST. Who nailed him?"
"It was an old fellow -- a stranger -- and he soldout his chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he's gotto go up the river and can't wait. Think o' that,now! You bet I'D wait, if it was seven year."
"That's me, every time," says I. "But maybe hischance ain't worth no more than that, if he'll sell it socheap. Maybe there's something ain't straight aboutit."
"But it IS, though -- straight as a string. I see thehandbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot --paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he'sfrum, below NewrLEANS. No-sirree-BOB, they ain't notrouble 'bout THAT speculation, you bet you. Say,gimme a chaw tobacker, won't ye?"
I didn't have none, so he left. I went to the raft,and set down in the wigwam to think. But I couldn'tcome to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore,but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble. Afterall this long journey, and after all we'd done for themscoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everythingall busted up and ruined, because they could have theheart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make hima slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too,for forty dirty dollars.
Once I said to myself it would be a thousand timesbetter for Jim to be a slave at home where his familywas, as long as he'd GOT to be a slave, and so I'd betterwrite a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell MissWatson where he was. But I soon give up that notionfor two things: she'd be mad and disgusted at hisrascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and soshe'd sell him straight down the river again; and ifshe didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungratefulnigger, and they'd make Jim feel it all the time, and sohe'd feel ornery and disgraced. And then think ofME! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped anigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to seeanybody from that town again I'd be ready to getdown and lick his boots for shame. That's just theway: a person does a low-down thing, and then hedon't want to take no consequences of it. Thinks aslong as he can hide, it ain't no disgrace. That wasmy fix exactly. The more I studied about this themore my conscience went to grinding me, and themore wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feel-ing. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden thathere was the plain hand of Providence slapping me inthe face and letting me know my wickedness was beingwatched all the time from up there in heaven,whilst Iwas stealing a poor old woman's nigger that hadn'tever done me no harm, and now was showing methere's One that's always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go onlyjust so fur and no further, I most dropped in mytracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I couldto kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying Iwas brung up wicked, and so I warn't so much toblame; but something inside of me kept saying,"There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone toit; and if you'd a done it they'd a learnt you therethat people that acts as I'd been acting about thatnigger goes to everlasting fire."
It made me shiver. And I about made up my mindto pray, and see if I couldn't try to quit being the kindof a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down.But the words wouldn't come. Why wouldn't they?It warn't no use to try and hide it from Him. Norfrom ME, neither. I knowed very well why theywouldn't come. It was because my heart warn't right;it was because I warn't square; it was because I wasplaying double. I was letting ON to give up sin, butaway inside of me I was holding on to the biggest oneof all. I was trying to make my mouth SAY I woulddo the right thing and the clean thing, and go and writeto that nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deepdown in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it.You can't pray a lie -- I found that out.
So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; anddidn't know what to do. At last I had an idea; and Isays, I'll go and write the letter -- and then see if I canpray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as lightas a feather right straight off, and my troubles allgone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, allglad and excited, and set down and wrote:
   Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down   here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps   has got him and he will give him up for the   reward if you send.
                                  HUCK FINN.
I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the firsttime I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed Icould pray now. But I didn't do it straight off, butlaid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinkinghow good it was all this happened so, and how near Icome to being lost and going to hell. And went onthinking. And got to thinking over our trip down theriver; and I see Jim before me all the time: in theday and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, some-times storms, and we a-floating along, talking andsinging and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seemto strike no places to harden me against him, but onlythe other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on topof his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleep-ing; and see him how glad he was when I come backout of the fog; and when I come to him again in theswamp, up there where the feud was; and such-liketimes; and would always call me honey, and pet meand do everything he could think of for me, and howgood he always was; and at last I struck the time Isaved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard,and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friendold Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he'sgot now; and then I happened to look around and seethat paper.
It was a close place. I took it up, and held it inmy hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to de-cide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. Istudied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and thensays to myself:
"All right, then, I'll GO to hell" -- and tore it up.
It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they wassaid. And I let them stay said; and never thought nomore about reforming. I shoved the whole thing outof my head, and said I would take up wickednessagain, which was in my line, being brung up to it, andthe other warn't. And for a starter I would go towork and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I couldthink up anything worse, I would do that, too; be-cause as long as I was in, and in for good, I might aswell go the whole hog.
Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, andturned over some considerable many ways in my mind;and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then Itook the bearings of a woody island that was downthe river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark Icrept out with my raft and went for it, and hid itthere, and then turned in. I slept the night through,and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,and put on my store clothes, and tied up some othersand one thing or another in a bundle, and took thecanoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where Ijudged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in thewoods, and then filled up the canoe with water, andloaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could findher again when I wanted her, about a quarter of amile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.
Then I struck up the road, and when I passed themill I see a sign on it, "Phelps's Sawmill," and whenI come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yardsfurther along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't seenobody around, though it was good daylight now.But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobodyjust yet -- I only wanted to get the lay of the land.According to my plan, I was going to turn up therefrom the village, not from below. So I just took alook, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, thevery first man I see when I got there was the duke.He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch --three-night performance -- like that other time. Theyhad the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him be-fore I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:
"Hel-LO! Where'd YOU come from?" Then hesays, kind of glad and eager, "Where's the raft? --got her in a good place?"
I says:
"Why, that's just what I was going to ask yourgrace."
Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:
"What was your idea for asking ME?" he says.
"Well," I says, "when I see the king in that dog-gery yesterday I says to myself, we can't get himhome for hours, till he's soberer; so I went a-loafingaround town to put in the time and wait. A man upand offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff overthe river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I wentalong; but when we was dragging him to the boat, andthe man left me a-holt of the rope and went behindhim to shove him along, he was too strong for me andjerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn'thave no dog, and so we had to chase him all over thecountry till we tired him out. We never got him tilldark; then we fetched him over, and I started downfor the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, Isays to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had toleave; and they've took my nigger, which is the onlynigger I've got in the world, and now I'm in a strangecountry, and ain't got no property no more, nor noth-ing, and no way to make my living;' so I set downand cried. I slept in the woods all night. But whatDID become of the raft, then? -- and Jim -- poor Jim!"
"Blamed if I know -- that is, what's become of theraft. That old fool had made a trade and got fortydollars, and when we found him in the doggery theloafers had matched half-dollars with him and gotevery cent but what he'd spent for whisky; and whenI got him home late last night and found the raft gone,we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and shookus, and run off down the river.'"
"I wouldn't shake my NIGGER, would I? -- the onlynigger I had in the world, and the only property."
"We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we'dcome to consider him OUR nigger; yes, we did considerhim so -- goodness knows we had trouble enough forhim. So when we see the raft was gone and we flatbroke, there warn't anything for it but to try theRoyal Nonesuch another shake. And I've peggedalong ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where's thatten cents? Give it here."
I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents,but begged him to spend it for something to eat, andgive me some, because it was all the money I had, andI hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday. He neversaid nothing. The next minute he whirls on me andsays:
"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?We'd skin him if he done that!"
"How can he blow? Hain't he run off?"
"No! That old fool sold him, and never dividedwith me, and the money's gone."
"SOLD him?" I says, and begun to cry; "why, hewas MY nigger, and that was my money. Where ishe? -- I want my nigger."
"Well, you can't GET your nigger, that's all -- sodry up your blubbering. Looky here -- do you thinkYOU'D venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I'dtrust you. Why, if you WAS to blow on us --"
He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly outof his eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:
"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't gotno time to blow, nohow. I got to turn out and findmy nigger."
He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with hisbills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling uphis forehead. At last he says:
"I'll tell you something. We got to be here threedays. If you'll promise you won't blow, and won'tlet the nigger blow, I'll tell you where to find him."
So I promised, and he says:
"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph----" and thenhe stopped. You see, he started to tell me the truth;but when he stopped that way, and begun to study andthink again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.And so he was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted tomake sure of having me out of the way the wholethree days. So pretty soon he says:
"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster-- Abram G. Foster -- and he lives forty mile backhere in the country, on the road to Lafayette."
"All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days.And I'll start this very afternoon."
"No you wont, you'll start NOW; and don't youlose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling bythe way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head andmove right along, and then you won't get into troublewith US, d'ye hear?"
That was the order I wanted, and that was the one Iplayed for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans.
"So clear out," he says; "and you can tell Mr.Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can gethim to believe that Jim IS your nigger -- some idiotsdon't require documents -- leastways I've heard there'ssuch down South here. And when you tell him thehandbill and the reward's bogus, maybe he'll believeyou when you explain to him what the idea was forgetting 'em out. Go 'long now, and tell him anythingyou want to; but mind you don't work your jaw anyBETWEEN here and there."
So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn'tlook around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me.But I knowed I could tire him out at that. I wentstraight out in the country as much as a mile before Istopped; then I doubled back through the woodstowards Phelps'. I reckoned I better start in on myplan straight off without fooling around, because Iwanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could getaway. I didn't want no trouble with their kind. I'dseen all I wanted to of them, and wanted to get entirelyshut of them.
