I set down one time back in the woods, and had along think about it. I says to myself, if a body canget anything they pray for, why don't Deacon Winnget back the money he lost on pork? Why can't thewidow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole?Why can't Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to myself, there ain't nothing in it. I went and told thewidow about it, and she said the thing a body couldget by praying for it was "spiritual gifts." This wastoo many for me, but she told me what she meant -- Imust help other people, and do everything I could forother people, and look out for them all the time, andnever think about myself. This was including MissWatson, as I took it. I went out in the woods andturned it over in my mind a long time, but I couldn'tsee no advantage about it -- except for the other peo-ple; so at last I reckoned I wouldn't worry about itany more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widowwould take me one side and talk about Providence in away to make a body's mouth water; but maybe nextday Miss Watson would take hold and knock it alldown again. I judged I could see that there was twoProvidences, and a poor chap would stand considerableshow with the widow's Providence, but if Miss Wat-son's got him there warn't no help for him any more.I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong tothe widow's if he wanted me, though I couldn't makeout how he was a-going to be any better off then thanwhat he was before, seeing I was so ignorant, and sokind of low-down and ornery.
Pap he hadn't been seen for more than a year, andthat was comfortable for me; I didn't want to see himno more. He used to always whale me when he wassober and could get his hands on me; though I usedto take to the woods most of the time when he wasaround. Well, about this time he was found in theriver drownded, about twelve mile above town, sopeople said. They judged it was him, anyway; saidthis drownded man was just his size, and was ragged,and had uncommon long hair, which was all like pap;but they couldn't make nothing out of the face, be-cause it had been in the water so long it warn't muchlike a face at all. They said he was floating on hisback in the water. They took him and buried him onthe bank. But I warn't comfortable long, because Ihappened to think of something. I knowed mightywell that a drownded man don't float on his back, buton his face. So I knowed, then, that this warn't pap,but a woman dressed up in a man's clothes. So I wasuncomfortable again. I judged the old man wouldturn up again by and by, though I wished he wouldn't.
We played robber now and then about a month, andthen I resigned. All the boys did. We hadn't robbednobody, hadn't killed any people, but only just pre-tended. We used to hop out of the woods and gocharging down on hog-drivers and women in cartstaking garden stuff to market, but we never hived anyof them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs "ingots," andhe called the turnips and stuff "julery," and we wouldgo to the cave and powwow over what we had done,and how many people we had killed and marked. ButI couldn't see no profit in it. One time Tom sent aboy to run about town with a blazing stick, which hecalled a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang toget together), and then he said he had got secret newsby his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanishmerchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in CaveHollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundredcamels, and over a thousand "sumter" mules, allloaded down with di'monds, and they didn't have onlya guard of four hundred soldiers, and so we would layin ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot andscoop the things. He said we must slick up our swordsand guns, and get ready. He never could go aftereven a turnip-cart but he must have the swords andguns all scoured up for it, though they was only lathand broomsticks, and you might scour at them till yourotted, and then they warn't worth a mouthful of ashesmore than what they was before. I didn't believe wecould lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs, butI wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was onhand next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and whenwe got the word we rushed out of the woods and downthe hill. But there warn't no Spaniards and A-rabs,and there warn't no camels nor no elephants. Itwarn't anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and onlya primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chasedthe children up the hollow; but we never got anythingbut some doughnuts and jam, though Ben Rogers gota rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and atract; and then the teacher charged in, and made usdrop everything and cut. I didn't see no di'monds,and I told Tom Sawyer so. He said there was loadsof them there, anyway; and he said there was A-rabsthere, too, and elephants and things. I said, whycouldn't we see them, then? He said if I warn't soignorant, but had read a book called Don Quixote, Iwould know without asking. He said it was all doneby enchantment. He said there was hundreds ofsoldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on,but we had enemies which he called magicians; andthey had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then thething for us to do was to go for the magicians. TomSawyer said I was a numskull.
"Why," said he, "a magician could call up a lotof genies, and they would hash you up like nothingbefore you could say Jack Robinson. They are as tallas a tree and as big around as a church."
"Well," I says, "s'pose we got some genies tohelp US -- can't we lick the other crowd then?"
"How you going to get them?"
"I don't know. How do THEY get them?"
"Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring,and then the genies come tearing in, with the thunderand lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling,and everything they're told to do they up and do it.They don't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower upby the roots, and belting a Sunday-school superinten-dent over the head with it -- or any other man."
"Who makes them tear around so?"
"Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. Theybelong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, andthey've got to do whatever he says. If he tells themto build a palace forty miles long out of di'monds, andfill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, andfetch an emperor's daughter from China for you tomarry, they've got to do it -- and they've got to do itbefore sun-up next morning, too. And more: they'vegot to waltz that palace around over the countrywherever you want it, you understand."
"Well," says I, "I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves 'stead offooling them away like that. And what's more -- if Iwas one of them I would see a man in Jericho before Iwould drop my business and come to him for the rub-bing of an old tin lamp."
"How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you'd HAVE tocome when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to ornot."
"What! and I as high as a tree and as big as achurch? All right, then; I WOULD come; but I layI'd make that man climb the highest tree there was inthe country."
"Shucks, it ain't no use to talk to you, Huck Finn.You don't seem to know anything, somehow -- perfectsaphead."
I thought all this over for two or three days, andthen I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it.I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out inthe woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like anInjun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but itwarn't no use, none of the genies come. So then Ijudged that all that stuff was only just one of TomSawyer's lies. I reckoned he believed in the A-rabsand the elephants, but as for me I think different. Ithad all the marks of a Sunday-school.
