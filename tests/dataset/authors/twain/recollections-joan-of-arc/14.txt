Joan Convinces the King
WELL, anything to make delay. The King's council advised him againstarriving at a decision in our matter too precipitately. He arrive at adecision too precipitately! So they sent a committee of priests--alwayspriests--into Lorraine to inquire into Joan's character and history--amatter which would consume several weeks, of course. You see howfastidious they were. It was as if people should come to put out the firewhen a man's house was burning down, and they waited till they could sendinto another country to find out if he had always kept the Sabbath ornot, before letting him try.
So the days poked along; dreary for us young people in some ways, but notin all, for we had one great anticipation in front of us; we had neverseen a king, and now some day we should have that prodigious spectacle tosee and to treasure in our memories all our lives; so we were on thelookout, and always eager and watching for the chance. The others weredoomed to wait longer than I, as it turned out. One day great newscame--the Orleans commissioners, with Yolande and our knights, had atlast turned the council's position and persuaded the King to see Joan.
Joan received the immense news gratefully but without losing her head,but with us others it was otherwise; we could not eat or sleep or do anyrational thing for the excitement and the glory of it. During two daysour pair of noble knights were in distress and trepidation on Joan'saccount, for the audience was to be at night, and they were afraid thatJoan would be so paralyzed by the glare of light from the long files oftorches, the solemn pomps and ceremonies, the great concourse of renownedpersonages, the brilliant costumes, and the other splendors of the Court,that she, a simple country-maid, and all unused to such things, would beovercome by these terrors and make a piteous failure.
No doubt I could have comforted them, but I was not free to speak. WouldJoan be disturbed by this cheap spectacle, this tinsel show, with itssmall King and his butterfly dukelets?--she who had spoken face to facewith the princes of heaven, the familiars of God, and seen their retinueof angels stretching back into the remoteness of the sky, myriads uponmyriads, like a measureless fan of light, a glory like the glory of thesun streaming from each of those innumerable heads, the massed radiancefilling the deeps of space with a blinding splendor? I thought not.
Queen Yolande wanted Joan to make the best possible impression upon theKing and the Court, so she was strenuous to have her clothed in therichest stuffs, wrought upon the princeliest pattern, and set off withjewels; but in that she had to be disappointed, of course, Joan not beingpersuadable to it, but begging to be simply and sincerely dressed, asbecame a servant of God, and one sent upon a mission of a serious sortand grave political import. So then the gracious Queen imagined andcontrived that simple and witching costume which I have described to youso many times, and which I cannot think of even now in my dull agewithout being moved just as rhythmical and exquisite music moves one; forthat was music, that dress--that is what it was--music that one saw witha the eyes and felt in the heart. Yes, she was a poem, she was a dream,she was a spirit when she was clothed in that.
She kept that raiment always, and wore it several times upon occasions ofstate, and it is preserved to this day in the Treasury of Orleans, withtwo of her swords, and her banner, and other things now sacred becausethey had belonged to her.
At the appointed time the Count of Vendome, a great lord of the court,came richly clothed, with his train of servants and assistants, toconduct Joan to the King, and the two knights and I went with her, beingentitled to this privilege by reason of our official positions near herperson.
When we entered the great audience-hall, there it all was just as I havealready painted it. Here were ranks of guards in shining armor and withpolished halberds; two sides of the hall were like flower-gardens forvariety of color and the magnificence of the costumes; light streamedupon these masses of color from two hundred and fifty flambeaux. Therewas a wide free space down the middle of the hall, and at the end of itwas a throne royally canopied, and upon it sat a crowned and scepteredfigure nobly clothed and blazing with jewels.
It is true that Joan had been hindered and put off a good while, but nowthat she was admitted to an audience at last, she was received withhonors granted to only the greatest personages. At the entrance doorstood four heralds in a row, in splendid tabards, with long slendersilver trumpets at their mouths, with square silken banners dependingfrom them embroidered with the arms of France. As Joan and the Countpassed by, these trumpets gave forth in unison one long rich note, and aswe moved down the hall under the pictured and gilded vaulting, this wasrepeated at every fifty feet of our progress--six times in all. It madeour good knights proud and happy, and they held themselves erect, andstiffened their stride, and looked fine and soldierly. They were notexpecting this beautiful and honorable tribute to our littlecountry-maid.
Joan walked two yards behind the Count, we three walked two yards behindJoan. Our solemn march ended when we were as yet some eight or ten stepsfrom the throne. The Count made a deep obeisance, pronounced Joan's name,then bowed again and moved to his place among a group of officials nearthe throne. I was devouring the crowned personage with all my eyes, andmy heart almost stood still with awe.
The eyes of all others were fixed upon Joan in a gaze of wonder which washalf worship, and which seemed to say, "How sweet--how lovely--howdivine!" All lips were parted and motionless, which was a sure sign thatthose people, who seldom forget themselves, had forgotten themselves now,and were not conscious of anything but the one object they were gazingupon. They had the look of people who are under the enchantment of avision.
Then they presently began to come to life again, rousing themselves outof the spell and shaking it off as one drives away little by little aclinging drowsiness or intoxication. Now they fixed their attention uponJoan with a strong new interest of another sort; they were full ofcuriosity to see what she would do--they having a secret and particularreason for this curiosity. So they watched. This is what they saw:
She made no obeisance, nor even any slight inclination of her head, butstood looking toward the throne in silence. That was all there was to seeat present.
I glanced up at De Metz, and was shocked at the paleness of his face. Iwhispered and said:
"What is it, man, what is it?"
His answering whisper was so weak I could hardly catch it:
"They have taken advantage of the hint in her letter to play a trick uponher! She will err, and they will laugh at her. That is not the King thatsits there."
Then I glanced at Joan. She was still gazing steadfastly toward thethrone, and I had the curious fancy that even her shoulders and the backof her head expressed bewilderment. Now she turned her head slowly, andher eye wandered along the lines of standing courtiers till it fell upona young man who was very quietly dressed; then her face lighted joyously,and she ran and threw herself at his feet, and clasped his knees,exclaiming in that soft melodious voice which was her birthright and wasnow charged with deep and tender feeling:
"God of his grace give you long life, O dear and gentle Dauphin!"
In his astonishment and exultation De Metz cried out:
"By the shadow of God, it is an amazing thing!" Then he mashed all thebones of my hand in his grateful grip, and added, with a proud shake ofhis mane, "Now, what have these painted infidels to say!"
Meantime the young person in the plain clothes was saying to Joan:
"Ah, you mistake, my child, I am not the King. There he is," and hepointed to the throne.
The knight's face clouded, and he muttered in grief and indignation:
"Ah, it is a shame to use her so. But for this lie she had gone throughsafe. I will go and proclaim to all the house what--"
"Stay where you are!" whispered I and the Sieur Bertrand in a breath, andmade him stop in his place.
Joan did not stir from her knees, but still lifted her happy face towardthe King, and said:
"No, gracious liege, you are he, and none other."
De Metz's troubles vanished away, and he said:
"Verily, she was not guessing, she knew. Now, how could she know? It is amiracle. I am content, and will meddle no more, for I perceive that sheis equal to her occasions, having that in her head that cannot profitablybe helped by the vacancy that is in mine."
This interruption of his lost me a remark or two of the other talk;however, I caught the King's next question:
"But tell me who you are, and what would you?"
"I am called Joan the Maid, and am sent to say that the King of Heavenwills that you be crowned and consecrated in your good city of Rheims,and be thereafter Lieutenant of the Lord of Heaven, who is King ofFrance. And He willeth also that you set me at my appointed work and giveme men-at-arms." After a slight pause she added, her eye lighting at thesound of her words, "For then will I raise the siege of Orleans and breakthe English power!"
The young monarch's amused face sobered a little when this martial speechfell upon that sick air like a breath blown from embattled camps andfields of war, and this trifling smile presently faded wholly away anddisappeared. He was grave now, and thoughtful. After a little he wavedhis hand lightly, and all the people fell away and left those two bythemselves in a vacant space. The knights and I moved to the oppositeside of the hall and stood there. We saw Joan rise at a sign, then sheand the King talked privately together.
All that host had been consumed with curiosity to see what Joan would do.Well, they had seen, and now they were full of astonishment to see thatshe had really performed that strange miracle according to the promise inher letter; and they were fully as much astonished to find that she wasnot overcome by the pomps and splendors about her, but was even moretranquil and at her ease in holding speech with a monarch than ever theythemselves had been, with all their practice and experience.
As for our two knights, they were inflated beyond measure with pride inJoan, but nearly dumb, as to speech, they not being able to think out anyway to account for her managing to carry herself through this imposingordeal without ever a mistake or an awkwardness of any kind to mar thegrace and credit of her great performance.
The talk between Joan and the King was long and earnest, and held in lowvoices. We could not hear, but we had our eyes and could note effects;and presently we and all the house noted one effect which was memorableand striking, and has been set down in memoirs and histories and intestimony at the Process of Rehabilitation by some who witnessed it; forall knew it was big with meaning, though none knew what that meaning wasat that time, of course. For suddenly we saw the King shake off hisindolent attitude and straighten up like a man, and at the same time lookimmeasurably astonished. It was as if Joan had told him something almosttoo wonderful for belief, and yet of a most uplifting and welcome nature.
It was long before we found out the secret of this conversation, but weknow it now, and all the world knows it. That part of the talk was likethis--as one may read in all histories. The perplexed King asked Joan fora sign. He wanted to believe in her and her mission, and that her Voiceswere supernatural and endowed with knowledge hidden from mortals, but howcould he do this unless these Voices could prove their claim in someabsolutely unassailable way? It was then that Joan said:
"I will give you a sign, and you shall no more doubt. There is a secrettrouble in your heart which you speak of to none--a doubt which wastesaway your courage, and makes you dream of throwing all away and fleeingfrom your realm. Within this little while you have been praying, in yourown breast, that God of his grace would resolve that doubt, even if thedoing of it must show you that no kingly right is lodged in you."
It was that that amazed the King, for it was as she had said: his prayerwas the secret of his own breast, and none but God could know about it.So he said:
"The sign is sufficient. I know now that these Voices are of God. Theyhave said true in this matter; if they have said more, tell it me--I willbelieve."
"They have resolved that doubt, and I bring their very words, which arethese: Thou art lawful heir to the King thy father, and true heir ofFrance. God has spoken it. Now lift up they head, and doubt no more, butgive me men-at-arms and let me get about my work."
Telling him he was of lawful birth was what straightened him up and madea man of him for a moment, removing his doubts upon that head andconvincing him of his royal right; and if any could have hanged hishindering and pestiferous council and set him free, he would haveanswered Joan's prayer and set her in the field. But no, those creatureswere only checked, not checkmated; they could invent some more delays.
We had been made proud by the honors which had so distinguished Joan'sentrance into that place--honors restricted to personages of very highrank and worth--but that pride was as nothing compared with the pride wehad in the honor done her upon leaving it. For whereas those first honorswere shown only to the great, these last, up to this time, had been shownonly to the royal. The King himself led Joan by the hand down the greathall to the door, the glittering multitude standing and making reverenceas they passed, and the silver trumpets sounding those rich notes oftheirs. Then he dismissed her with gracious words, bending low over herhand and kissing it. Always--from all companies, high or low--she wentforth richer in honor and esteem than when she came.
And the King did another handsome thing by Joan, for he sent us back toCourdray Castle torch-lighted and in state, under escort of his owntroop--his guard of honor--the only soldiers he had; and finely equippedand bedizened they were, too, though they hadn't seen the color of theirwages since they were children, as a body might say. The wonders whichJoan had been performing before the King had been carried all around bythis time, so the road was so packed with people who wanted to get asight of her that we could hardly dig through; and as for talkingtogether, we couldn't, all attempts at talk being drowned in the storm ofshoutings and huzzas that broke out all along as we passed, and keptabreast of us like a wave the whole way.
