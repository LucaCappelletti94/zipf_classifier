She was not quite what you would call refined. She was not quite whatyou would call unrefined. She was the kind of person that keeps aparrot. --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.
So far as I am able to judge, nothing has been left undone, either by manor Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sunvisits on his round. Nothing seems to have been forgotten, nothing overlooked. Always, when you think you have come to the end of hertremendous specialties and have finished banging tags upon her as theLand of the Thug, the Land of the Plague, the Land of Famine, the Land ofGiant Illusions, the Land of Stupendous Mountains, and so forth, anotherspecialty crops up and another tag is required. I have been overlookingthe fact that India is by an unapproachable supremacy--the Land ofMurderous Wild Creatures. Perhaps it will be simplest to throw away thetags and generalize her with one all-comprehensive name, as the Land ofWonders.
For many years the British Indian Government has been trying to destroythe murderous wild creatures, and has spent a great deal of money in theeffort. The annual official returns show that the undertaking is adifficult one.
These returns exhibit a curious annual uniformity in results; the sort ofuniformity which you find in the annual output of suicides in the world'scapitals, and the proportions of deaths by this, that, and the otherdisease. You can always come close to foretelling how many suicides willoccur in Paris, London, and New York, next year, and also how many deathswill result from cancer, consumption, dog-bite, falling out of thewindow, getting run over by cabs, etc., if you know the statistics ofthose matters for the present year. In the same way, with one year'sIndian statistics before you, you can guess closely at how many peoplewere killed in that Empire by tigers during the previous year, and theyear before that, and the year before that, and at how many were killedin each of those years by bears, how many by wolves, and how many bysnakes; and you can also guess closely at how many people are going to bekilled each year for the coming five years by each of those agencies.You can also guess closely at how many of each agency the government isgoing to kill each year for the next five years.
I have before me statistics covering a period of six consecutive years.By these, I know that in India the tiger kills something over 800 personsevery year, and that the government responds by killing about double asmany tigers every year. In four of the six years referred to, the tigergot 800 odd; in one of the remaining two years he got only 700, but inthe other remaining year he made his average good by scoring 917. He isalways sure of his average. Anyone who bets that the tiger will kill2,400 people in India in any three consecutive years has invested hismoney in a certainty; anyone who bets that he will kill 2,600 in anythree consecutive years, is absolutely sure to lose.
As strikingly uniform as are the statistics of suicide, they are not anymore so than are those of the tiger's annual output of slaughtered humanbeings in India. The government's work is quite uniform, too; it aboutdoubles the tiger's average. In six years the tiger killed 5,000persons, minus 50; in the same six years 10,000 tigers were killed, minus400.
The wolf kills nearly as many people as the tiger--700 a year to thetiger's 800 odd--but while he is doing it, more than 5,000 of his tribefall.
The leopard kills an average of 230 people per year, but loses 3,300 ofhis own mess while he is doing it.
The bear kills 100 people per year at a cost of 1,250 of his own tribe.
The tiger, as the figures show, makes a very handsome fight against man.But it is nothing to the elephant's fight. The king of beasts, the lordof the jungle, loses four of his mess per year, but he kills forty--fivepersons to make up for it.
But when it comes to killing cattle, the lord of the jungle is notinterested. He kills but 100 in six years--horses of hunters, no doubt--but in the same six the tiger kills more than 84,000, the leopard100,000, the bear 4,000, the wolf 70,000, the hyena more than 13,000,other wild beasts 27,000, and the snakes 19,000, a grand total of morethan 300,000; an average of 50,000 head per year.
In response, the government kills, in the six years, a total of 3,201,232wild beasts and snakes. Ten for one.
It will be perceived that the snakes are not much interested in cattle;they kill only 3,000 odd per year. The snakes are much more interestedin man. India swarms with deadly snakes. At the head of the list is thecobra, the deadliest known to the world, a snake whose bite kills wherethe rattlesnake's bite merely entertains.
In India, the annual man-killings by snakes are as uniform, as regular,and as forecastable as are the tiger-average and the suicide-average.Anyone who bets that in India, in any three consecutive years the snakeswill kill 49,500 persons, will win his bet; and anyone who bets that inIndia in any three consecutive years, the snakes will kill 53,500persons, will lose his bet. In India the snakes kill 17,000 people ayear; they hardly ever fall short of it; they as seldom exceed it. Aninsurance actuary could take the Indian census tables and thegovernment's snake tables and tell you within sixpence how much it wouldbe worth to insure a man against death by snake-bite there. If I had adollar for every person killed per year in India, I would rather have itthan any other property, as it is the only property in the world notsubject to shrinkage.
I should like to have a royalty on the government-end of the snakebusiness, too, and am in London now trying to get it; but when I get itit is not going to be as regular an income as the other will be if I getthat; I have applied for it. The snakes transact their end of thebusiness in a more orderly and systematic way than the governmenttransacts its end of it, because the snakes have had a long experienceand know all about the traffic. You can make sure that the governmentwill never kill fewer than 110,000 snakes in a year, and that it willnewer quite reach 300,000 too much room for oscillation; good speculativestock, to bear or bull, and buy and sell long and short, and all thatkind of thing, but not eligible for investment like the other. The manthat speculates in the government's snake crop wants to go carefully. Iwould not advise a man to buy a single crop at all--I mean a crop offutures for the possible wobble is something quite extraordinary. If hecan buy six future crops in a bunch, seller to deliver 1,500,000altogether, that is another matter. I do not know what snakes are worthnow, but I know what they would be worth then, for the statistics showthat the seller could not come within 427,000 of carrying out hiscontract. However, I think that a person who speculates in snakes is afool, anyway. He always regrets it afterwards.
To finish the statistics. In six years the wild beasts kill 20,000persons, and the snakes kill 103,000. In the same six the governmentkills 1,073,546 snakes. Plenty left.
There are narrow escapes in India. In the very jungle where I killedsixteen tigers and all those elephants, a cobra bit me but it got well;everyone was surprised. This could not happen twice in ten years,perhaps. Usually death would result in fifteen minutes.
We struck out westward or northwestward from Calcutta on an itinerary ofa zig-zag sort, which would in the course of time carry us across Indiato its northwestern corner and the border of Afghanistan. The first partof the trip carried us through a great region which was an endlessgarden--miles and miles of the beautiful flower from whose juices comesthe opium, and at Muzaffurpore we were in the midst of the indigoculture; thence by a branch road to the Ganges at a point near Dinapore,and by a train which would have missed the connection by a week but forthe thoughtfulness of some British officers who were along, and who knewthe ways of trains that are run by natives without white supervision.This train stopped at every village; for no purpose connected withbusiness, apparently. We put out nothing, we took nothing aboard. Thetrain bands stepped ashore and gossiped with friends a quarter of anhour, then pulled out and repeated this at the succeeding villages. Wehad thirty-five miles to go and six hours to do it in, but it was plainthat we were not going to make it. It was then that the English officerssaid it was now necessary to turn this gravel train into an express. Sothey gave the engine-driver a rupee and told him to fly. It was a simpleremedy. After that we made ninety miles an hour. We crossed the Gangesjust at dawn, made our connection, and went to Benares, where we stayedtwenty-four hours and inspected that strange and fascinating piety-hiveagain; then left for Lucknow, a city which is perhaps the mostconspicuous of the many monuments of British fortitude and valor that arescattered about the earth.
The heat was pitiless, the flat plains were destitute of grass, and bakeddry by the sun they were the color of pale dust, which was flying inclouds. But it was much hotter than this when the relieving forcesmarched to Lucknow in the time of the Mutiny. Those were the days of 138deg. in the shade.
