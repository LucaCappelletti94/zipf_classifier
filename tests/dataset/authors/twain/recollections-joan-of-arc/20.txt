Joan Puts Heart in Her Army
WE WERE at Blois three days. Oh, that camp, it is one of the treasures ofmy memory! Order? There was no more order among those brigands than thereis among the wolves and the hyenas. They went roaring and drinking about,whooping, shouting, swearing, and entertaining themselves with all mannerof rude and riotous horse-play; and the place was full of loud and lewdwomen, and they were no whit behind the men for romps and noise andfantastics.
It was in the midst of this wild mob that Noel and I had our firstglimpse of La Hire. He answered to our dearest dreams. He was of greatsize and of martial bearing, he was cased in mail from head to heel, witha bushel of swishing plumes on his helmet, and at his side the vast swordof the time.
He was on his way to pay his respects in state to Joan, and as he passedthrough the camp he was restoring order, and proclaiming that the Maidhad come, and he would have no such spectacle as this exposed to the headof the army. His way of creating order was his own, not borrowed. He didit with his great fists. As he moved along swearing and admonishing, helet drive this way, that way, and the other, and wherever his blowlanded, a man went down.
"Damn you!" he said, "staggering and cursing around like this, and theCommander-in-Chief in the camp! Straighten up!" and he laid the man flat.What his idea of straightening up was, was his own secret.
We followed the veteran to headquarters, listening, observing,admiring--yes, devouring, you may say, the pet hero of the boys of Francefrom our cradles up to that happy day, and their idol and ours. I calledto mind how Joan had once rebuked the Paladin, there in the pastures ofDomremy, for uttering lightly those mighty names, La Hire and the Bastardof Orleans, and how she said that if she could but be permitted to standafar off and let her eyes rest once upon those great men, she would holdit a privilege. They were to her and the other girls just what they wereto the boys. Well, here was one of them at last--and what was his errand?It was hard to realize it, and yet it was true; he was coming to uncoverhis head before her and take her orders.
While he was quieting a considerable group of his brigands in hissoothing way, near headquarters, we stepped on ahead and got a glimpse ofJoan's military family, the great chiefs of the army, for they had allarrived now. There they were, six officers of wide renown, handsome menin beautiful armor, but the Lord High Admiral of France was thehandsomest of them all and had the most gallant bearing.
When La Hire entered, one could see the surprise in his face at Joan'sbeauty and extreme youth, and one could see, too, by Joan's glad smile,that it made her happy to get sight of this hero of her childhood atlast. La Hire bowed low, with his helmet in his gauntleted hand, and madea bluff but handsome little speech with hardly an oath in it, and onecould see that those two took to each other on the spot.
The visit of ceremony was soon over, and the others went away; but LaHire stayed, and he and Joan sat there, and he sipped her wine, and theytalked and laughed together like old friends. And presently she gave himsome instructions, in his quality as master of the camp, which made hisbreath stand still. For, to begin with, she said that all those loosewomen must pack out of the place at once, she wouldn't allow one of themto remain. Next, the rough carousing must stop, drinking must be broughtwithin proper and strictly defined limits, and discipline must take theplace of disorder. And finally she climaxed the list of surprises withthis--which nearly lifted him out of his armor:
"Every man who joins my standard must confess before the priest andabsolve himself from sin; and all accepted recruits must be present atdivine service twice a day."
La Hire could not say a word for a good part of a minute, then he said,in deep dejection:
"Oh, sweet child, they were littered in hell, these poor darlings ofmine! Attend mass? Why, dear heart, they'll see us both damned first!"
And he went on, pouring out a most pathetic stream of arguments andblasphemy, which broke Joan all up, and made her laugh as she had notlaughed since she played in the Domremy pastures. It was good to hear.
But she stuck to her point; so the soldier yielded, and said all right,if such were the orders he must obey, and would do the best that was inhim; then he refreshed himself with a lurid explosion of oaths, and saidthat if any man in the camp refused to renounce sin and lead a piouslife, he would knock his head off. That started Joan off again; she wasreally having a good time, you see. But she would not consent to thatform of conversions. She said they must be voluntary.
La Hire said that that was all right, he wasn't going to kill thevoluntary ones, but only the others.
No matter, none of them must be killed--Joan couldn't have it. She saidthat to give a man a chance to volunteer, on pain of death if he didn't,left him more or less trammeled, and she wanted him to be entirely free.
So the soldier sighed and said he would advertise the mass, but said hedoubted if there was a man in camp that was any more likely to go to itthan he was himself. Then there was another surprise for him, for Joansaid:
"But, dear man, you are going!"
"I? Impossible! Oh, this is lunacy!"
"Oh, no, it isn't. You are going to the service--twice a day."
"Oh, am I dreaming? Am I drunk--or is my hearing playing me false? Why, Iwould rather go to--"
"Never mind where. In the morning you are going to begin, and after thatit will come easy. Now don't look downhearted like that. Soon you won'tmind it."
La Hire tried to cheer up, but he was not able to do it. He sighed like azephyr, and presently said:
"Well, I'll do it for you, but before I would do it for another, I swearI--"
"But don't swear. Break it off."
"Break it off? It is impossible! I beg you to--to-- Why--oh, my General,it is my native speech!"
He begged so hard for grace for his impediment, that Joan left him onefragment of it; she said he might swear by his bton, the symbol of hisgeneralship.
He promised that he would swear only by his bton when in her presence,and would try to modify himself elsewhere, but doubted he could manageit, now that it was so old and stubborn a habit, and such a solace andsupport to his declining years.
That tough old lion went away from there a good deal tamed andcivilized--not to say softened and sweetened, for perhaps thoseexpressions would hardly fit him. Noel and I believed that when he wasaway from Joan's influence his old aversions would come up so strong inhim that he could not master them, and so wouldn't go to mass. But we gotup early in the morning to see.
Satan was converted, you see. Well, the rest followed. Joan rode up anddown that camp, and wherever that fair young form appeared in its shiningarmor, with that sweet face to grace the vision and perfect it, the rudehost seemed to think they saw the god of war in person, descended out ofthe clouds; and first they wondered, then they worshiped. After that, shecould do with them what she would.
In three days it was a clean camp and orderly, and those barbarians wereherding to divine service twice a day like good children. The women weregone. La Hire was stunned by these marvels; he could not understand them.He went outside the camp when he wanted to swear. He was that sort of aman--sinful by nature and habit, but full of superstitious respect forholy places.
The enthusiasm of the reformed army for Joan, its devotion to her, andthe hot desire had aroused in it to be led against the enemy, exceededany manifestations of this sort which La Hire had ever seen before in hislong career. His admiration of it all, and his wonder over the mysteryand miracle of it, were beyond his power to put into words. He had heldthis army cheap before, but his pride and confidence in it knew no limitsnow. He said:
"Two or three days ago it was afraid of a hen-roost; one could storm thegates of hell with it now."
Joan and he were inseparable, and a quaint and pleasant contrast theymade. He was so big, she so little; he was so gray and so far along inhis pilgrimage of life, she so youthful; his face was so bronzed andscarred, hers so fair and pink, so fresh and smooth; she was so gracious,and he so stern; she was so pure, so innocent, he such a cyclopedia ofsin. In her eye was stored all charity and compassion, in his lightnings;when her glance fell upon you it seemed to bring benediction and thepeace of God, but with his it was different, generally.
They rode through the camp a dozen times a day, visiting every corner ofit, observing, inspecting, perfecting; and wherever they appeared theenthusiasm broke forth. They rode side by side, he a great figure ofbrawn and muscle, she a little masterwork of roundness and grace; he afortress of rusty iron, she a shining statuette of silver; and when thereformed raiders and bandits caught sight of them they spoke out, withaffection and welcome in their voices, and said:
"There they come--Satan and the Page of Christ!"
All the three days that we were in Blois, Joan worked earnestly andtirelessly to bring La Hire to God--to rescue him from the bondage ofsin--to breathe into his stormy hear the serenity and peace of religion.She urged, she begged, she implored him to pray. He stood out, three daysof our stay, begging about piteously to be let off--to be let off fromjust that one thing, that impossible thing; he would do anythingelse--anything--command, and he would obey--he would go through the firefor her if she said the word--but spare him this, only this, for hecouldn't pray, had never prayed, he was ignorant of how to frame aprayer, he had no words to put it in.
And yet--can any believe it?--she carried even that point, she won thatincredible victory. She made La Hire pray. It shows, I think, thatnothing was impossible to Joan of Arc. Yes, he stood there before her andput up his mailed hands and made a prayer. And it was not borrowed, butwas his very own; he had none to help him frame it, he made it out of hisown head--saying:
"Fair Sir God, I pray you to do by La Hire as he would do by you if youwere La Hire and he were God." [1]
Then he put on his helmet and marched out of Joan's tent as satisfiedwith himself as any one might be who had arranged a perplexed anddifficult business to the content and admiration of all the partiesconcerned in the matter.
If I had know that he had been praying, I could have understood why hewas feeling so superior, but of course I could not know that.
I was coming to the tent at that moment, and saw him come out, and sawhim march away in that large fashion, and indeed it was fine andbeautiful to see. But when I got to the tent door I stopped and steppedback, grieved and shocked, for I heard Joan crying, as I mistakenlythought--crying as if she could not contain nor endure the anguish of hersoul, crying as if she would die. But it was not so, she waslaughing--laughing at La Hire's prayer.
It was not until six-and-thirty years afterward that I found that out,and then--oh, then I only cried when that picture of young care-freemirth rose before me out of the blur and mists of that long-vanishedtime; for there had come a day between, when God's good gift of laughterhad gone out from me to come again no more in this life.
[1] This prayer has been stolen many times and by many nations in thepast four hundred and sixty years, but it originated with La Hire, andthe fact is of official record in the National Archives of France. Wehave the authority of Michelet for this. --TRANSLATOR
