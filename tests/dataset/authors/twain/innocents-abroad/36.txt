We have got so far east, now--a hundred and fifty-five degrees oflongitude from San Francisco--that my watch can not "keep the hang" ofthe time any more. It has grown discouraged, and stopped. I think itdid a wise thing. The difference in time between Sebastopol and thePacific coast is enormous. When it is six o'clock in the morning here,it is somewhere about week before last in California. We are excusablefor getting a little tangled as to time. These distractions anddistresses about the time have worried me so much that I was afraid mymind was so much affected that I never would have any appreciation oftime again; but when I noticed how handy I was yet about comprehendingwhen it was dinner-time, a blessed tranquillity settled down upon me, andI am tortured with doubts and fears no more.
Odessa is about twenty hours' run from Sebastopol, and is the mostnortherly port in the Black Sea. We came here to get coal, principally.The city has a population of one hundred and thirty-three thousand, andis growing faster than any other small city out of America. It is a freeport, and is the great grain mart of this particular part of the world.Its roadstead is full of ships. Engineers are at work, now, turning theopen roadstead into a spacious artificial harbor. It is to be almostinclosed by massive stone piers, one of which will extend into the seaover three thousand feet in a straight line.
I have not felt so much at home for a long time as I did when I "raisedthe hill" and stood in Odessa for the first time. It looked just like anAmerican city; fine, broad streets, and straight as well; low houses,(two or three stories,) wide, neat, and free from any quaintness ofarchitectural ornamentation; locust trees bordering the sidewalks (theycall them acacias;) a stirring, business-look about the streets and thestores; fast walkers; a familiar new look about the houses and everything; yea, and a driving and smothering cloud of dust that was so like amessage from our own dear native land that we could hardly refrain fromshedding a few grateful tears and execrations in the old time-honoredAmerican way. Look up the street or down the street, this way or thatway, we saw only America! There was not one thing to remind us that wewere in Russia. We walked for some little distance, reveling in thishome vision, and then we came upon a church and a hack-driver, andpresto! the illusion vanished! The church had a slender-spired dome thatrounded inward at its base, and looked like a turnip turned upside down,and the hackman seemed to be dressed in a long petticoat with out anyhoops. These things were essentially foreign, and so were the carriages--but every body knows about these things, and there is no occasion formy describing them.
We were only to stay here a day and a night and take in coal; weconsulted the guide-books and were rejoiced to know that there were nosights in Odessa to see; and so we had one good, untrammeled holyday onour hands, with nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoyourselves. We sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearfuland wonderful costumes from the back country; examined the populace asfar as eyes could do it; and closed the entertainment with an ice-creamdebauch. We do not get ice-cream every where, and so, when we do, we areapt to dissipate to excess. We never cared any thing about ice-cream athome, but we look upon it with a sort of idolatry now that it is soscarce in these red-hot climates of the East.
We only found two pieces of statuary, and this was another blessing. Onewas a bronze image of the Duc de Richelieu, grand-nephew of the splendidCardinal. It stood in a spacious, handsome promenade, overlooking thesea, and from its base a vast flight of stone steps led down to theharbor--two hundred of them, fifty feet long, and a wide landing at thebottom of every twenty. It is a noble staircase, and from a distance thepeople toiling up it looked like insects. I mention this statue and thisstairway because they have their story. Richelieu founded Odessa--watched over it with paternal care--labored with a fertile brain and awise understanding for its best interests--spent his fortune freely tothe same end--endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yetmake it one of the great cities of the Old World--built this noblestairway with money from his own private purse--and--. Well, the peoplefor whom he had done so much, let him walk down these same steps, oneday, unattended, old, poor, without a second coat to his back; and when,years afterwards, he died in Sebastopol in poverty and neglect, theycalled a meeting, subscribed liberally, and immediately erected thistasteful monument to his memory, and named a great street after him.It reminds me of what Robert Burns' mother said when they erected astately monument to his memory: "Ah, Robbie, ye asked them for bread andthey hae gi'en ye a stane."
The people of Odessa have warmly recommended us to go and call on theEmperor, as did the Sebastopolians. They have telegraphed his Majesty,and he has signified his willingness to grant us an audience. So we aregetting up the anchors and preparing to sail to his watering-place. Whata scratching around there will be, now! what a holding of importantmeetings and appointing of solemn committees!--and what a furbishing upof claw-hammer coats and white silk neck-ties! As this fearful ordeal weare about to pass through pictures itself to my fancy in all its dreadsublimity, I begin to feel my fierce desire to converse with a genuineEmperor cooling down and passing away. What am I to do with my hands?What am I to do with my feet? What in the world am I to do with myself?
