FROM DIARY:
November 1--noon. A fine day, a brilliant sun. Warm in the sun, coldin the shade--an icy breeze blowing out of the south. A solemn longswell rolling up northward. It comes from the South Pole, with nothingin the way to obstruct its march and tone its energy down. I have readsomewhere that an acute observer among the early explorers--Cook? orTasman?--accepted this majestic swell as trustworthy circumstantialevidence that no important land lay to the southward, and so did notwaste time on a useless quest in that direction, but changed his courseand went searching elsewhere.
Afternoon. Passing between Tasmania (formerly Van Diemen's Land) andneighboring islands--islands whence the poor exiled Tasmanian savagesused to gaze at their lost homeland and cry; and die of broken hearts.How glad I am that all these native races are dead and gone, or nearlyso. The work was mercifully swift and horrible in some portions ofAustralia. As far as Tasmania is concerned, the extermination wascomplete: not a native is left. It was a strife of years, and decades ofyears. The Whites and the Blacks hunted each other, ambushed each other,butchered each other. The Blacks were not numerous. But they were wary,alert, cunning, and they knew their country well. They lasted a longtime, few as they were, and inflicted much slaughter upon the Whites.
The Government wanted to save the Blacks from ultimate extermination, ifpossible. One of its schemes was to capture them and coop them up, on aneighboring island, under guard. Bodies of Whites volunteered for thehunt, for the pay was good--L5 for each Black captured and delivered, butthe success achieved was not very satisfactory. The Black was naked, andhis body was greased. It was hard to get a grip on him that would hold.The Whites moved about in armed bodies, and surprised little families ofnatives, and did make captures; but it was suspected that in thesesurprises half a dozen natives were killed to one caught--and that wasnot what the Government desired.
Another scheme was to drive the natives into a corner of the island andfence them in by a cordon of men placed in line across the country; butthe natives managed to slip through, constantly, and continue theirmurders and arsons.
The governor warned these unlettered savages by printed proclamation thatthey must stay in the desolate region officially appointed for them! Theproclamation was a dead letter; the savages could not read it. Afterwarda picture-proclamation was issued. It was painted up on boards, andthese were nailed to trees in the forest. Herewith is a photographicreproduction of this fashion-plate. Substantially it means: 
1.  The Governor wishes the Whites and the Blacks to love each other;
2.  He loves his black subjects;
3.  Blacks who kill Whites will be hanged;
4.  Whites who kill Blacks will be hanged.
Upon its several schemes the Government spent L30,000 and employed thelabors and ingenuities of several thousand Whites for a long time withfailure as a result.  Then, at last, a quarter of a century after thebeginning of the troubles between the two races, the right man was found.No, he found himself.  This was George Augustus Robinson, called inhistory "The Conciliator."  He was not educated, and not conspicuous inany way.  He was a working bricklayer, in Hobart Town.  But he must havebeen an amazing personality; a man worth traveling far to see.  It may behis counterpart appears in history, but I do not know where to look forit.
He set himself this incredible task: to go out into the wilderness, thejungle, and the mountain-retreats where the hunted and implacable savageswere hidden, and appear among them unarmed, speak the language of loveand of kindness to them, and persuade them to forsake their homes and thewild free life that was so dear to them, and go with him and surrender tothe hated Whites and live under their watch and ward, and upon theircharity the rest of their lives!  On its face it was the dream of amadman.
In the beginning, his moral-suasion project was sarcastically dubbed thesugar plum speculation.  If the scheme was striking, and new to theworld's experience, the situation was not less so.  It was this.  TheWhite population numbered 40,000 in 1831; the Black population numberedthree hundred.  Not 300 warriors, but 300 men, women, and children.  TheWhites were armed with guns, the Blacks with clubs and spears.  TheWhites had fought the Blacks for a quarter of a century, and had triedevery thinkable way to capture, kill, or subdue them; and could not doit.  If white men of any race could have done it, these would haveaccomplished it.  But every scheme had failed, the splendid 300, thematchless 300 were unconquered, and manifestly unconquerable.  They wouldnot yield, they would listen to no terms, they would fight to the bitterend.  Yet they had no poet to keep up their heart, and sing the marvel oftheir magnificent patriotism.
At the end of five-and-twenty years of hard fighting, the surviving 300naked patriots were still defiant, still persistent, still efficaciouswith their rude weapons, and the Governor and the 40,000 knew not whichway to turn, nor what to do.
Then the Bricklayer--that wonderful man--proposed to go out into thewilderness, with no weapon but his tongue, and no protection but hishonest eye and his humane heart; and track those embittered savages totheir lairs in the gloomy forests and among the mountain snows.Naturally, he was considered a crank.  But he was not quite that.  Infact, he was a good way short of that.  He was building upon his long andintimate knowledge of the native character.  The deriders of his projectwere right--from their standpoint--for they believed the natives to bemere wild beasts; and Robinson was right, from his standpoint--for hebelieved the natives to be human beings.  The truth did really liebetween the two.  The event proved that Robinson's judgment was soundest;but about once a month for four years the event came near to giving theverdict to the deriders, for about that frequently Robinson barelyescaped falling under the native spears.
But history shows that he had a thinking head, and was not a mere wildsentimentalist.  For instance, he wanted the war parties (called) inbefore he started unarmed upon his mission of peace.  He wanted the bestchance of success--not a half-chance.  And he was very willing to havehelp; and so, high rewards were advertised, for any who would go unarmedwith him.  This opportunity was declined.  Robinson persuaded some tamednatives of both sexes to go with him--a strong evidence of his persuasivepowers, for those natives well knew that their destruction would bealmost certain.  As it turned out, they had to face death over and overagain.
Robinson and his little party had a difficult undertaking upon theirhands.  They could not ride off, horseback, comfortably into the woodsand call Leonidas and his 300 together for a talk and a treaty thefollowing day; for the wild men were not in a body; they were scattered,immense distances apart, over regions so desolate that even the birdscould not make a living with the chances offered--scattered in groups oftwenty, a dozen, half a dozen, even in groups of three.  And the missionmust go on foot.  Mr. Bonwick furnishes a description of those horribleregions, whereby it will be seen that even fugitive gangs of the hardiestand choicest human devils the world has seen--the convicts set apart topeople the "Hell of Macquarrie Harbor Station"--were never able, butonce, to survive the horrors of a march through them, but starving andstruggling, and fainting and failing, ate each other, and died:
"Onward, still onward, was the order of the indomitable Robinson.  No oneignorant of the western country of Tasmania can form a correct idea ofthe traveling difficulties.  While I was resident in Hobart Town, theGovernor, Sir John Franklin, and his lady, undertook the western journeyto Macquarrie Harbor, and suffered terribly.  One man who assisted tocarry her ladyship through the swamps, gave me his bitter experience ofits miseries.  Several were disabled for life.  No wonder that but oneparty, escaping from Macquarrie Harbor convict settlement, arrived at thecivilized region in safety.  Men perished in the scrub, were lost insnow, or were devoured by their companions.  This was the territorytraversed by Mr. Robinson and his Black guides.  All honor to hisintrepidity, and their wonderful fidelity!  When they had, in the depthof winter, to cross deep and rapid rivers, pass among mountains sixthousand feet high, pierce dangerous thickets, and find food in a countryforsaken even by birds, we can realize their hardships.
"After a frightful journey by Cradle Mountain, and over the lofty plateauof Middlesex Plains, the travelers experienced unwonted misery, and thecircumstances called forth the best qualities of the noble little band.Mr. Robinson wrote afterwards to Mr. Secretary Burnett some details ofthis passage of horrors.  In that letter, of Oct 2, 1834, he states thathis Natives were very reluctant to go over the dreadful mountain passes;that 'for seven successive days we continued traveling over one solidbody of snow;'  that 'the snows were of incredible depth;'  that 'theNatives were frequently up to their middle in snow.'  But still theill-clad, ill-fed, diseased, and way-worn men and women were sustained bythe cheerful voice of their unconquerable friend, and responded mostnobly to his call."
Mr. Bonwick says that Robinson's friendly capture of the Big River triberemember, it was a whole tribe--"was by far the grandest feature of thewar, and the crowning glory of his efforts." The word "war" was not wellchosen, and is misleading.  There was war still, but only the Blacks wereconducting it--the Whites were holding off until Robinson could give hisscheme a fair trial.  I think that we are to understand that the friendlycapture of that tribe was by far the most important thing, the highest invalue, that happened during the whole thirty years of trucelesshostilities; that it was a decisive thing, a peaceful Waterloo, thesurrender of the native Napoleon and his dreaded forces, the happy endingof the long strife.  For "that tribe was the terror of the colony," itschief "the Black Douglas of Bush households."
Robinson knew that these formidable people were lurking somewhere, insome remote corner of the hideous regions just described, and he and hisunarmed little party started on a tedious and perilous hunt for them.  Atlast, "there, under the shadows of the Frenchman's Cap, whose grim conerose five thousand feet in the uninhabited westward interior," they werefound.  It was a serious moment.  Robinson himself believed, for once,that his mission, successful until now, was to end here in failure, andthat his own death-hour had struck.
The redoubtable chief stood in menacing attitude, with his eighteen-footspear poised; his warriors stood massed at his back, armed for battle,their faces eloquent with their long-cherished loathing for white men."They rattled their spears and shouted their war-cry."  Their women wereback of them, laden with supplies of weapons, and keeping their 150 eagerdogs quiet until the chief should give the signal to fall on.
"I think we shall soon be in the resurrection," whispered a member ofRobinson's little party.
"I think we shall," answered Robinson; then plucked up heart and beganhis persuasions--in the tribe's own dialect, which surprised and pleasedthe chief.  Presently there was an interruption by the chief:
"Who are you?"
"We are gentlemen."
"Where are your guns?"
"We have none."
The warrior was astonished.
"Where your little guns?" (pistols).
"We have none."
A few minutes passed--in by-play--suspense--discussion among thetribesmen--Robinson's tamed squaws ventured to cross the line and beginpersuasions upon the wild squaws.  Then the chief stepped back "to conferwith the old women--the real arbiters of savage war."  Mr. Bonwickcontinues:
     "As the fallen gladiator in the arena looks for the signal of life     or death from the president of the amphitheatre, so waited our     friends in anxious suspense while the conference continued.  In a     few minutes, before a word was uttered, the women of the tribe threw     up their arms three times.  This was the inviolable sign of peace!     Down fell the spears.  Forward, with a heavy sigh of relief, and     upward glance of gratitude, came the friends of peace.  The     impulsive natives rushed forth with tears and cries, as each saw in     the other's rank a loved one of the past.
     "It was a jubilee of joy.  A festival followed.  And, while tears     flowed at the recital of woe, a corrobory of pleasant laughter     closed the eventful day."
In four years, without the spilling of a drop of blood, Robinson broughtthem all in, willing captives, and delivered them to the white governor,and ended the war which powder and bullets, and thousands of men to usethem, had prosecuted without result since 1804.
Marsyas charming the wild beasts with his music--that is fable; but themiracle wrought by Robinson is fact.  It is history--and authentic; andsurely, there is nothing greater, nothing more reverence-compelling inthe history of any country, ancient or modern.
And in memory of the greatest man Australasia ever developed or ever willdevelop, there is a stately monument to George Augustus Robinson, theConciliator in--no, it is to another man, I forget his name.
However, Robertson's own generation honored him, and in manifesting ithonored themselves.  The Government gave him a money-reward and athousand acres of land; and the people held mass-meetings and praised himand emphasized their praise with a large subscription of money.
A good dramatic situation; but the curtain fell on another:
     "When this desperate tribe was thus captured, there was much     surprise to find that the L30,000 of a little earlier day had been     spent, and the whole population of the colony placed under arms, in     contention with an opposing force of sixteen men with wooden spears!     Yet such was the fact.  The celebrated Big River tribe, that had     been raised by European fears to a host, consisted of sixteen men,     nine women, and one child.  With a knowledge of the mischief done by     these few, their wonderful marches and their widespread aggressions,     their enemies cannot deny to them the attributes of courage and     military tact.  A Wallace might harass a large army with a small and     determined band; but the contending parties were at least equal in     arms and civilization.  The Zulus who fought us in Africa, the     Maories in New Zealand, the Arabs in the Soudan, were far better     provided with weapons, more advanced in the science of war, and     considerably more numerous, than the naked Tasmanians.  Governor     Arthur rightly termed them a noble race."
These were indeed wonderful people, the natives.  They ought not to havebeen wasted.  They should have been crossed with the Whites.  It wouldhave improved the Whites and done the Natives no harm.
But the Natives were wasted, poor heroic wild creatures.  They weregathered together in little settlements on neighboring islands, andpaternally cared for by the Government, and instructed in religion, anddeprived of tobacco, because the superintendent of the Sunday-school wasnot a smoker, and so considered smoking immoral.
The Natives were not used to clothes, and houses, and regular hours, andchurch, and school, and Sunday-school, and work, and the other misplacedpersecutions of civilization, and they pined for their lost home andtheir wild free life.  Too late they repented that they had traded thatheaven for this hell.  They sat homesick on their alien crags, and day byday gazed out through their tears over the sea with unappeasable longingtoward the hazy bulk which was the specter of what had been theirparadise; one by one their hearts broke and they died.
In a very few years nothing but a scant remnant remained alive.  Ahandful lingered along into age.  In 1864 the last man died, in 1876 thelast woman died, and the Spartans of Australasia were extinct.
The Whites always mean well when they take human fish out of the oceanand try to make them dry and warm and happy and comfortable in a chickencoop; but the kindest-hearted white man can always be depended on toprove himself inadequate when he deals with savages.  He cannot turn thesituation around and imagine how he would like it to have a well-meaningsavage transfer him from his house and his church and his clothes and hisbooks and his choice food to a hideous wilderness of sand and rocks andsnow, and ice and sleet and storm and blistering sun, with no shelter, nobed, no covering for his and his family's naked bodies, and nothing toeat but snakes and grubs and 'offal.  This would be a hell to him; and ifhe had any wisdom he would know that his own civilization is a hell tothe savage--but he hasn't any, and has never had any; and for lack of ithe shut up those poor natives in the unimaginable perdition of hiscivilization, committing his crime with the very best intentions, and sawthose poor creatures waste away under his tortures; and gazed at it,vaguely troubled and sorrowful, and wondered what could be the matterwith them.  One is almost betrayed into respecting those criminals, theywere so sincerely kind, and tender, and humane; and well-meaning.
They didn't know why those exiled savages faded away, and they did theirhonest best to reason it out.  And one man, in a like case in New SouthWales, did reason it out and arrive at a solution:
     "It is from the wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven against     cold ungodliness and unrighteousness of men."
That settles it.
