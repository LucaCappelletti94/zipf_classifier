Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plan-tations, and they all look alike. A rail fence round atwo-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off andup-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, toclimb over the fence with, and for the women to standon when they are going to jump on to a horse; somesickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it wasbare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbedoff; big double log-house for the white folks -- hewedlogs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar,and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time oranother; round-log kitchen, with a big broad, openbut roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabinsin a row t'other side the smoke-house; one little hutall by itself away down against the back fence, andsome outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut;bench by the kitchen door, with bucket of water and agourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more houndsasleep round about; about three shade trees away offin a corner; some currant bushes and gooseberrybushes in one place by the fence; outside of the fencea garden and a watermelon patch; then the cottonfields begins, and after the fields the woods.
I went around and clumb over the back stile by theash-hopper, and started for the kitchen. When I gota little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheelwailing along up and sinking along down again; andthen I knowed for certain I wished I was dead -- forthat IS the lonesomest sound in the whole world.
I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan,but just trusting to Providence to put the right wordsin my mouth when the time come; for I'd noticed thatProvidence always did put the right words in my mouthif I left it alone.
When I got half-way, first one hound and thenanother got up and went for me, and of course Istopped and faced them, and kept still. And suchanother powwow as they made! In a quarter of aminute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel, as you maysay -- spokes made out of dogs -- circle of fifteenof them packed together around me, with their necksand noses stretched up towards me, a-barking andhowling; and more a-coming; you could see them sail-ing over fences and around corners from everywheres.
A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen witha rolling-pin in her hand, singing out, "Begone YOUTige! you Spot! begone sah!" and she fetched firstone and then another of them a clip and sent themhowling, and then the rest followed; and the nextsecond half of them come back, wagging their tailsaround me, and making friends with me. There ain'tno harm in a hound, nohow.
And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl andtwo little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linenshirts, and they hung on to their mother's gown, andpeeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the waythey always do. And here comes the white womanrunning from the house, about forty-five or fifty yearold, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand;and behind her comes her little white children, actingthe same way the little niggers was going. She wassmiling all over so she could hardly stand -- and says:
"It's YOU, at last! -- AIN'T it?"
I out with a "Yes'm" before I thought.
She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and thengripped me by both hands and shook and shook; andthe tears come in her eyes, and run down over; andshe couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and keptsaying, "You don't look as much like your mother asI reckoned you would; but law sakes, I don't care forthat, I'm so glad to see you! Dear, dear, it does seemlike I could eat you up! Children, it's your cousinTom! -- tell him howdy."
But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers intheir mouths, and hid behind her. So she run on:
"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast rightaway -- or did you get your breakfast on the boat?"
I said I had got it on the boat. So then she startedfor the house, leading me by the hand, and the childrentagging after. When we got there she set me down ina split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a littlelow stool in front of me, holding both of my hands,and says:
"Now I can have a GOOD look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry for it a many and a many a time,all these long years, and it's come at last! We beenexpecting you a couple of days and more. What kep'you? -- boat get aground?"
"Yes'm -- she --"
"Don't say yes'm -- say Aunt Sally. Where'd sheget aground?"
I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn'tknow whether the boat would be coming up the riveror down. But I go a good deal on instinct; and myinstinct said she would be coming up -- from downtowards Orleans. That didn't help me much, though;for I didn't know the names of bars down that way. Isee I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the name of theone we got aground on -- or -- Now I struck an idea,and fetched it out:
"It warn't the grounding -- that didn't keep us backbut a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head."
"Good gracious! anybody hurt?"
"No'm. Killed a nigger."
"Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do gethurt. Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silaswas coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook,and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.And I think he died afterwards. He was a Baptist.Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rougethat knowed his people very well. Yes, I remembernow, he DID die. Mortification set in, and they had toamputate him. But it didn't save him. Yes, it wasmortification -- that was it. He turned blue all over,and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. Theysay he was a sight to look at. Your uncle's been upto the town every day to fetch you. And he's goneagain, not more'n an hour ago; he'll be back anyminute now. You must a met him on the road, didn'tyou? -- oldish man, with a --"
"No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boatlanded just at daylight, and I left my baggage on thewharf-boat and went looking around the town and outa piece in the country, to put in the time and not gethere too soon; and so I come down the back way."
"Who'd you give the baggage to?"
"Nobody."
"Why, child, it 'll be stole!"
"Not where I hid it I reckon it won't," I says.
"How'd you get your breakfast so early on theboat?"
It was kinder thin ice, but I says:
"The captain see me standing around, and told meI better have something to eat before I went ashore;so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch, andgive me all I wanted."
I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good. Ihad my mind on the children all the time; I wanted toget them out to one side and pump them a little, andfind out who I was. But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she madethe cold chills streak all down my back, because shesays:
"But here we're a-running on this way, and youhain't told me a word about Sis, nor any of them.Now I'll rest my works a little, and you start up yourn;just tell me EVERYTHING -- tell me all about 'm allevery one of 'm; and how they are, and what they'redoing, and what they told you to tell me; and everylast thing you can think of."
Well, I see I was up a stump -- and up it good.Providence had stood by me this fur all right, but Iwas hard and tight aground now. I see it warn't a bitof use to try to go ahead -- I'd got to throw up myhand. So I says to myself, here's another place whereI got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin;but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed,and says:
"Here he comes! Stick your head down lower --there, that'll do; you can't be seen now. Don't youlet on you're here. I'll play a joke on him. Children,don't you say a word."
I see I was in a fix now. But it warn't no use toworry; there warn't nothing to do but just hold still,and try and be ready to stand from under when thelightning struck.
I had just one little glimpse of the old gentlemanwhen he come in; then the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelpsshe jumps for him, and says:
"Has he come?"
"No," says her husband.
"Good-NESS gracious!" she says, "what in thewarld can have become of him?"
"I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "andI must say it makes me dreadful uneasy."
"Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted!He MUST a come; and you've missed him along theroad. I KNOW it's so -- something tells me so."
"Why, Sally, I COULDN'T miss him along the road --YOU know that."
"But oh, dear, dear, what WILL Sis say! He must acome! You must a missed him. He --"
"Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already dis-tressed. I don't know what in the world to make of it.I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind acknowledging't I'm right down scared. But there's no hope thathe's come; for he COULDN'T come and me miss him.Sally, it's terrible -- just terrible -- something's hap-pened to the boat, sure!"
"Why, Silas! Look yonder! -- up the road! -- ain'tthat somebody coming?"
He sprung to the window at the head of the bed,and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted. Shestooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give mea pull, and out I come; and when he turned backfrom the window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smil-ing like a house afire, and I standing pretty meek andsweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared, andsays:
"Why, who's that?"
"Who do you reckon 't is?"
"I hain't no idea. Who IS it?"
"It's TOM SAWYER!"
By jings, I most slumped through the floor! Butthere warn't no time to swap knives; the old mangrabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on shak-ing; and all the time how the woman did dance aroundand laugh and cry; and then how they both did fire offquestions about Sid, and Mary, and the rest of thetribe.
But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what Iwas; for it was like being born again, I was so glad tofind out who I was. Well, they froze to me for twohours; and at last, when my chin was so tired itcouldn't hardly go any more, I had told them moreabout my family -- I mean the Sawyer family -- thanever happened to any six Sawyer families. And I ex-plained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head atthe mouth of White River, and it took us three days tofix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; be-cause THEY didn't know but what it would take threedays to fix it. If I'd a called it a bolthead it would adone just as well.
Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down oneside, and pretty uncomfortable all up the other. Be-ing Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable, and itstayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear asteamboat coughing along down the river. Then Isays to myself, s'pose Tom Sawyer comes down on thatboat? And s'pose he steps in here any minute, andsings out my name before I can throw him a wink tokeep quiet?
Well, I couldn't HAVE it that way; it wouldn't do atall. I must go up the road and waylay him. So Itold the folks I reckoned I would go up to the townand fetch down my baggage. The old gentleman wasfor going along with me, but I said no, I could drivethe horse myself, and I druther he wouldn't take notrouble about me.
