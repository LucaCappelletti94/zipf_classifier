 THE BURIED CITY OF POMPEII
They pronounce it Pom-pay-e. I always had an idea that you went downinto Pompeii with torches, by the way of damp, dark stairways, just asyou do in silver mines, and traversed gloomy tunnels with lava overheadand something on either hand like dilapidated prisons gouged out of thesolid earth, that faintly resembled houses. But you do nothing the kind.Fully one-half of the buried city, perhaps, is completely exhumed andthrown open freely to the light of day; and there stand the long rows ofsolidly-built brick houses (roofless) just as they stood eighteen hundredyears ago, hot with the flaming sun; and there lie their floors,clean-swept, and not a bright fragment tarnished or waiting of thelabored mosaics that pictured them with the beasts, and birds, andflowers which we copy in perishable carpets to-day; and here are theVenuses, and Bacchuses, and Adonises, making love and getting drunk inmany-hued frescoes on the walls of saloon and bed-chamber; and there arethe narrow streets and narrower sidewalks, paved with flags of good hardlava, the one deeply rutted with the chariot-wheels, and the other withthe passing feet of the Pompeiians of by-gone centuries; and there arethe bake-shops, the temples, the halls of justice, the baths, thetheatres--all clean-scraped and neat, and suggesting nothing of thenature of a silver mine away down in the bowels of the earth. Thebroken pillars lying about, the doorless doorways and the crumbled topsof the wilderness of walls, were wonderfully suggestive of the "burntdistrict" in one of our cities, and if there had been any charredtimbers, shattered windows, heaps of debris, and general blackness andsmokiness about the place, the resemblance would have been perfect. Butno--the sun shines as brightly down on old Pompeii to-day as it did whenChrist was born in Bethlehem, and its streets are cleaner a hundredtimes than ever Pompeiian saw them in her prime. I know whereof Ispeak--for in the great, chief thoroughfares (Merchant street and theStreet of Fortune) have I not seen with my own eyes how for two hundredyears at least the pavements were not repaired!--how ruts five and eventen inches deep were worn into the thick flagstones by thechariot-wheels of generations of swindled tax-payers? And do I not knowby these signs that Street Commissioners of Pompeii never attended totheir business, and that if they never mended the pavements they nevercleaned them? And, besides, is it not the inborn nature of StreetCommissioners to avoid their duty whenever they get a chance? I wish Iknew the name of the last one that held office in Pompeii so that Icould give him a blast. I speak with feeling on this subject, because Icaught my foot in one of those ruts, and the sadness that came over mewhen I saw the first poor skeleton, with ashes and lava sticking to it,was tempered by the reflection that may be that party was the StreetCommissioner.
No--Pompeii is no longer a buried city. It is a city of hundreds andhundreds of roofless houses, and a tangled maze of streets where onecould easily get lost, without a guide, and have to sleep in some ghostlypalace that had known no living tenant since that awful November night ofeighteen centuries ago.
We passed through the gate which faces the Mediterranean, (called the"Marine Gate,") and by the rusty, broken image of Minerva, still keepingtireless watch and ward over the possessions it was powerless to save,and went up a long street and stood in the broad court of the Forum ofJustice. The floor was level and clean, and up and down either side wasa noble colonnade of broken pillars, with their beautiful Ionic andCorinthian columns scattered about them. At the upper end were thevacant seats of the Judges, and behind them we descended into a dungeonwhere the ashes and cinders had found two prisoners chained on thatmemorable November night, and tortured them to death. How they must havetugged at the pitiless fetters as the fierce fires surged around them!
Then we lounged through many and many a sumptuous private mansion whichwe could not have entered without a formal invitation in incomprehensibleLatin, in the olden time, when the owners lived there--and we probablywouldn't have got it. These people built their houses a good deal alike.The floors were laid in fanciful figures wrought in mosaics ofmany-colored marbles. At the threshold your eyes fall upon a Latinsentence of welcome, sometimes, or a picture of a dog, with the legend"Beware of the Dog," and sometimes a picture of a bear or a faun with noinscription at all. Then you enter a sort of vestibule, where they usedto keep the hat-rack, I suppose; next a room with a large marble basinin the midst and the pipes of a fountain; on either side are bedrooms;beyond the fountain is a reception-room, then a little garden,dining-room, and so forth and so on. The floors were all mosaic, thewalls were stuccoed, or frescoed, or ornamented with bas-reliefs, andhere and there were statues, large and small, and little fish-pools, andcascades of sparkling water that sprang from secret places in thecolonnade of handsome pillars that surrounded the court, and kept theflower-beds fresh and the air cool. Those Pompeiians were veryluxurious in their tastes and habits. The most exquisite bronzes wehave seen in Europe, came from the exhumed cities of Herculaneum andPompeii, and also the finest cameos and the most delicate engravings onprecious stones; their pictures, eighteen or nineteen centuries old, areoften much more pleasing than the celebrated rubbish of the old mastersof three centuries ago. They were well up in art. From the creation ofthese works of the first, clear up to the eleventh century, art seemshardly to have existed at all--at least no remnants of it are left--andit was curious to see how far (in some things, at any rate,) these oldtime pagans excelled the remote generations of masters that came afterthem. The pride of the world in sculptures seem to be the Laocoon andthe Dying Gladiator, in Rome. They are as old as Pompeii, were dug fromthe earth like Pompeii; but their exact age or who made them can only beconjectured. But worn, and cracked, without a history, and with theblemishing stains of numberless centuries upon them, they still mutelymock at all efforts to rival their perfections.
It was a quaint and curious pastime, wandering through this old silentcity of the dead--lounging through utterly deserted streets wherethousands and thousands of human beings once bought and sold, and walkedand rode, and made the place resound with the noise and confusion oftraffic and pleasure. They were not lazy. They hurried in those days.We had evidence of that. There was a temple on one corner, and it was ashorter cut to go between the columns of that temple from one street tothe other than to go around--and behold that pathway had been worn deepinto the heavy flagstone floor of the building by generations oftime-saving feet! They would not go around when it was quicker to gothrough. We do that way in our cities.
Every where, you see things that make you wonder how old these old houseswere before the night of destruction came--things, too, which bring backthose long dead inhabitants and place the living before your eyes. Forinstance: The steps (two feet thick--lava blocks) that lead up out of theschool, and the same kind of steps that lead up into the dress circle ofthe principal theatre, are almost worn through! For ages the boyshurried out of that school, and for ages their parents hurried into thattheatre, and the nervous feet that have been dust and ashes for eighteencenturies have left their record for us to read to-day. I imagined Icould see crowds of gentlemen and ladies thronging into the theatre, withtickets for secured seats in their hands, and on the wall, I read theimaginary placard, in infamous grammar, "POSITIVELY NO FREE LIST, EXCEPTMEMBERS OF THE PRESS!" Hanging about the doorway (I fancied,) wereslouchy Pompeiian street-boys uttering slang and profanity, and keeping awary eye out for checks. I entered the theatre, and sat down in one ofthe long rows of stone benches in the dress circle, and looked at theplace for the orchestra, and the ruined stage, and around at the widesweep of empty boxes, and thought to myself, "This house won't pay." Itried to imagine the music in full blast, the leader of the orchestrabeating time, and the "versatile" So-and-So (who had "just returned froma most successful tour in the provinces to play his last and farewellengagement of positively six nights only, in Pompeii, previous to hisdeparture for Herculaneum,") charging around the stage and piling theagony mountains high--but I could not do it with such a "house" as that;those empty benches tied my fancy down to dull reality. I said, thesepeople that ought to be here have been dead, and still, and moldering todust for ages and ages, and will never care for the trifles and folliesof life any more for ever--"Owing to circumstances, etc., etc., therewill not be any performance to-night." Close down the curtain. Put outthe lights.
And so I turned away and went through shop after shop and store afterstore, far down the long street of the merchants, and called for thewares of Rome and the East, but the tradesmen were gone, the marts weresilent, and nothing was left but the broken jars all set in cement ofcinders and ashes: the wine and the oil that once had filled them weregone with their owners.
In a bake-shop was a mill for grinding the grain, and the furnaces forbaking the bread: and they say that here, in the same furnaces, theexhumers of Pompeii found nice, well baked loaves which the baker had notfound time to remove from the ovens the last time he left his shop,because circumstances compelled him to leave in such a hurry.
In one house (the only building in Pompeii which no woman is now allowedto enter,) were the small rooms and short beds of solid masonry, just asthey were in the old times, and on the walls were pictures which lookedalmost as fresh as if they were painted yesterday, but which no pen couldhave the hardihood to describe; and here and there were Latininscriptions--obscene scintillations of wit, scratched by hands thatpossibly were uplifted to Heaven for succor in the midst of a drivingstorm of fire before the night was done.
In one of the principal streets was a ponderous stone tank, and awater-spout that supplied it, and where the tired, heated toilers from theCampagna used to rest their right hands when they bent over to put theirlips to the spout, the thick stone was worn down to a broad groove aninch or two deep. Think of the countless thousands of hands that hadpressed that spot in the ages that are gone, to so reduce a stone thatis as hard as iron!
They had a great public bulletin board in Pompeii--a place whereannouncements for gladiatorial combats, elections, and such things, wereposted--not on perishable paper, but carved in enduring stone. One lady,who, I take it, was rich and well brought up, advertised a dwelling or soto rent, with baths and all the modern improvements, and several hundredshops, stipulating that the dwellings should not be put to immoralpurposes. You can find out who lived in many a house in Pompeii by thecarved stone door-plates affixed to them: and in the same way you cantell who they were that occupy the tombs. Every where around are thingsthat reveal to you something of the customs and history of this forgottenpeople. But what would a volcano leave of an American city, if it oncerained its cinders on it? Hardly a sign or a symbol to tell its story.
In one of these long Pompeiian halls the skeleton of a man was found,with ten pieces of gold in one hand and a large key in the other. He hadseized his money and started toward the door, but the fiery tempestcaught him at the very threshold, and he sank down and died. One moreminute of precious time would have saved him. I saw the skeletons of aman, a woman, and two young girls. The woman had her hands spread wideapart, as if in mortal terror, and I imagined I could still trace uponher shapeless face something of the expression of wild despair thatdistorted it when the heavens rained fire in these streets, so many agesago. The girls and the man lay with their faces upon their arms, as ifthey had tried to shield them from the enveloping cinders. In oneapartment eighteen skeletons were found, all in sitting postures, andblackened places on the walls still mark their shapes and show theirattitudes, like shadows. One of them, a woman, still wore upon herskeleton throat a necklace, with her name engraved upon it--JULIE DIDIOMEDE.
But perhaps the most poetical thing Pompeii has yielded to modernresearch, was that grand figure of a Roman soldier, clad in completearmor; who, true to his duty, true to his proud name of a soldier ofRome, and full of the stern courage which had given to that name itsglory, stood to his post by the city gate, erect and unflinching, tillthe hell that raged around him burned out the dauntless spirit it couldnot conquer.
We never read of Pompeii but we think of that soldier; we can not writeof Pompeii without the natural impulse to grant to him the mention he sowell deserves. Let us remember that he was a soldier--not a policeman--and so, praise him. Being a soldier, he staid,--because the warriorinstinct forbade him to fly. Had he been a policeman he would havestaid, also--because he would have been asleep.
There are not half a dozen flights of stairs in Pompeii, and no otherevidences that the houses were more than one story high. The people didnot live in the clouds, as do the Venetians, the Genoese and Neapolitansof to-day.
We came out from under the solemn mysteries of this city of the VenerablePast--this city which perished, with all its old ways and its quaint oldfashions about it, remote centuries ago, when the Disciples werepreaching the new religion, which is as old as the hills to us now--andwent dreaming among the trees that grow over acres and acres of its stillburied streets and squares, till a shrill whistle and the cry of "Allaboard--last train for Naples!" woke me up and reminded me that Ibelonged in the nineteenth century, and was not a dusty mummy, caked withashes and cinders, eighteen hundred years old. The transition wasstartling. The idea of a railroad train actually running to old deadPompeii, and whistling irreverently, and calling for passengers in themost bustling and business-like way, was as strange a thing as one couldimagine, and as unpoetical and disagreeable as it was strange.
Compare the cheerful life and the sunshine of this day with the horrorsthe younger Pliny saw here, the 9th of November, A.D. 79, when he was sobravely striving to remove his mother out of reach of harm, while shebegged him, with all a mother's unselfishness, to leave her to perish andsave himself. 
     'By this time the murky darkness had so increased that one might     have believed himself abroad in a black and moonless night, or in a     chamber where all the lights had been extinguished.  On every hand     was heard the complaints of women, the wailing of children, and the     cries of men.  One called his father, another his son, and another     his wife, and only by their voices could they know each other.  Many     in their despair begged that death would come and end their     distress.
     "Some implored the gods to succor them, and some believed that this     night was the last, the eternal night which should engulf the     universe!
     "Even so it seemed to me--and I consoled myself for the coming death     with the reflection: BEHOLD, THE WORLD IS PASSING AWAY!"
                              * * * * * * * *
After browsing among the stately ruins of Rome, of Baiae, of Pompeii, andafter glancing down the long marble ranks of battered and namelessimperial heads that stretch down the corridors of the Vatican, one thingstrikes me with a force it never had before: the unsubstantial, unlastingcharacter of fame.  Men lived long lives, in the olden time, andstruggled feverishly through them, toiling like slaves, in oratory, ingeneralship, or in literature, and then laid them down and died, happy inthe possession of an enduring history and a deathless name.  Well, twentylittle centuries flutter away, and what is left of these things?  A crazyinscription on a block of stone, which snuffy antiquaries bother over andtangle up and make nothing out of but a bare name (which they spellwrong)--no history, no tradition, no poetry--nothing that can give iteven a passing interest.  What may be left of General Grant's great nameforty centuries hence?  This--in the Encyclopedia for A. D. 5868,possibly:
     "URIAH S. (or Z.) GRAUNT--popular poet of ancient times in the Aztec     provinces of the United States of British America.  Some authors say     flourished about A. D. 742; but the learned Ah-ah Foo-foo states     that he was a cotemporary of Scharkspyre, the English poet, and     flourished about A. D. 1328, some three centuries after the Trojan     war instead of before it.  He wrote 'Rock me to Sleep, Mother.'"
These thoughts sadden me.  I will to bed.
