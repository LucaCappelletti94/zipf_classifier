  Close your eyes, my love, let me make you blind;	 They have taught you to see	Only a mean arithmetic on the face of things,	A cunning algebra in the faces of men,	 And God like geometry Completing his circles, and working cleverly.	 I'll kiss you over the eyes till I kiss you blind;	 If I can--if any one could.	Then perhaps in the dark you'll have got what you want to find.	You've discovered so many bits, with your clever eyes,  And I'm a kaleidoscope	That you shake and shake, and yet it won't come to your mind.	Now stop carping at me.--But God, how I hate you!	 Do you fear I shall swindle you?	Do you think if you take me as I am, that that will abate you Somehow?--so sad, so intrinsic, so spiritual, yet so cautious, you	Must have me all in your will and your consciousness--	 I hate you.
