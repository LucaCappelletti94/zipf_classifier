Nothing is so ignorant as a man's left hand, except a lady's watch.
 --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.

You notice that Mrs. Praed knows her art.  She can place a thing beforeyou so that you can see it.  She is not alone in that.  Australia isfertile in writers whose books are faithful mirrors of the life of thecountry and of its history.  The materials were surprisingly rich, bothin quality and in mass, and Marcus Clarke, Ralph Boldrewood, Cordon,Kendall, and the others, have built out of them a brilliant and vigorousliterature, and one which must endure.  Materials--there is no end tothem!  Why, a literature might be made out of the aboriginal all byhimself, his character and ways are so freckled with varieties--varietiesnot staled by familiarity, but new to us.  You do not need to invent anypicturesquenesses; whatever you want in that line he can furnish you; andthey will not be fancies and doubtful, but realities and authentic.  Inhis history, as preserved by the white man's official records, he iseverything--everything that a human creature can be.  He covers theentire ground.  He is a coward--there are a thousand fact to prove it.He is brave--there are a thousand facts to prove it.  He is treacherous--oh, beyond imagination! he is faithful, loyal, true--the white man'srecords supply you with a harvest of instances of it that are noble,worshipful, and pathetically beautiful.  He kills the starving strangerwho comes begging for food and shelter there is proof of it.  He succors,and feeds, and guides to safety, to-day, the lost stranger who fired onhim only yesterday--there is proof of it.  He takes his reluctant brideby force, he courts her with a club, then loves her faithfully through along life--it is of record.  He gathers to himself another wife by thesame processes, beats and bangs her as a daily diversion, and by and bylays down his life in defending her from some outside harm--it is ofrecord.  He will face a hundred hostiles to rescue one of his children,and will kill another of his children because the family is large enoughwithout it.  His delicate stomach turns, at certain details of the whiteman's food; but he likes over-ripe fish, and brazed dog, and cat, andrat, and will eat his own uncle with relish.  He is a sociable animal,yet he turns aside and hides behind his shield when his mother-in-lawgoes by.  He is childishly afraid of ghosts and other trivialities thatmenace his soul, but dread of physical pain is a weakness which he is notacquainted with.  He knows all the great and many of the littleconstellations, and has names for them; he has a symbol-writing by meansof which he can convey messages far and wide among the tribes; he has acorrect eye for form and expression, and draws a good picture; he cantrack a fugitive by delicate traces which the white man's eye cannotdiscern, and by methods which the finest white intelligence cannotmaster; he makes a missile which science itself cannot duplicate withoutthe model--if with it; a missile whose secret baffled and defeated thesearchings and theorizings of the white mathematicians for seventy years;and by an art all his own he performs miracles with it which the whiteman cannot approach untaught, nor parallel after teaching.  Withincertain limits this savage's intellect is the alertest and the brightestknown to history or tradition; and yet the poor creature was never ableto invent a counting system that would reach above five, nor a vesselthat he could boil water in.  He is the prize-curiosity of all the races.To all intents and purposes he is dead--in the body; but he has featuresthat will live in literature.
Mr. Philip Chauncy, an officer of the Victorian Government, contributedto its archives a report of his personal observations of the aboriginalswhich has in it some things which I wish to condense slightly and inserthere.  He speaks of the quickness of their eyes and the accuracy of theirjudgment of the direction of approaching missiles as being quiteextraordinary, and of the answering suppleness and accuracy of limb andmuscle in avoiding the missile as being extraordinary also.  He has seenan aboriginal stand as a target for cricket-balls thrown with great forceten or fifteen yards, by professional bowlers, and successfully dodgethem or parry them with his shield during about half an hour.  One ofthose balls, properly placed, could have killed him; "Yet he depended,with the utmost self-possession, on the quickness of his eye and hisagility."
The shield was the customary war-shield of his race, and would not be aprotection to you or to me.  It is no broader than a stovepipe, and isabout as long as a man's arm.  The opposing surface is not flat, butslopes away from the centerline like a boat's bow.  The difficulty abouta cricket-ball that has been thrown with a scientific "twist" is, that itsuddenly changes it course when it is close to its target and comesstraight for the mark when apparently it was going overhead or to oneside.  I should not be able to protect myself from such balls forhalf-an-hour, or less.
Mr. Chauncy once saw "a little native man" throw a cricket-ball 119yards.  This is said to beat the English professional record by thirteenyards.
We have all seen the circus-man bound into the air from a spring-boardand make a somersault over eight horses standing side by side.  Mr.Chauncy saw an aboriginal do it over eleven; and was assured that he hadsometimes done it over fourteen.  But what is that to this:
     "I saw the same man leap from the ground, and in going over he     dipped his head, unaided by his hands, into a hat placed in an     inverted position on the top of the head of another man sitting     upright on horseback--both man and horse being of the average size.     The native landed on the other side of the horse with the hat fairly     on his head.  The prodigious height of the leap, and the precision     with which it was taken so as to enable him to dip his head into the     hat, exceeded any feat of the kind I have ever beheld."
I should think so!  On board a ship lately I saw a young Oxford athleterun four steps and spring into the air and squirm his hips by aside-twist over a bar that was five and one-half feet high; but he couldnot have stood still and cleared a bar that was four feet high.  I knowthis, because I tried it myself.
One can see now where the kangaroo learned its art.
Sir George Grey and Mr. Eyre testify that the natives dug wells fourteenor fifteen feet deep and two feet in diameter at the bore--dug them inthe sand--wells that were "quite circular, carried straight down, and thework beautifully executed."
Their tools were their hands and feet.  How did they throw sand out fromsuch a depth?  How could they stoop down and get it, with only two feetof space to stoop in?  How did they keep that sand-pipe from caving inon them?  I do not know.  Still, they did manage those seemingimpossibilities.  Swallowed the sand, may be.
Mr. Chauncy speaks highly of the patience and skill and alertintelligence of the native huntsman when he is stalking the emu, thekangaroo, and other game:
     "As he walks through the bush his step is light, elastic, and     noiseless; every track on the earth catches his keen eye; a leaf, or     fragment of a stick turned, or a blade of grass recently bent by the     tread of one of the lower animals, instantly arrests his attention;     in fact, nothing escapes his quick and powerful sight on the ground,     in the trees, or in the distance, which may supply him with a meal     or warn him of danger.  A little examination of the trunk of a tree     which may be nearly covered with the scratches of opossums ascending     and descending is sufficient to inform him whether one went up the     night before without coming down again or not."
Fennimore Cooper lost his chance.  He would have known how to value thesepeople.  He wouldn't have traded the dullest of them for the brightestMohawk he ever invented.
All savages draw outline pictures upon bark; but the resemblances are notclose, and expression is usually lacking.  But the Australianaboriginal's pictures of animals were nicely accurate in form, attitude,carriage; and he put spirit into them, and expression.  And his picturesof white people and natives were pretty nearly as good as his pictures ofthe other animals.  He dressed his whites in the fashion of their day,both the ladies and the gentlemen.  As an untaught wielder of the pencilit is not likely that he has had his equal among savage people.
His place in art--as to drawing, not color-work--is well up, all thingsconsidered.  His art is not to be classified with savage art at all, buton a plane two degrees above it and one degree above the lowest plane ofcivilized art.  To be exact, his place in art is between Botticelli andDe Maurier.  That is to say, he could not draw as well as De Maurier butbetter than Boticelli.  In feeling, he resembles both; also in groupingand in his preferences in the matter of subjects.  His "corrobboree" ofthe Australian wilds reappears in De Maurier's Belgravian ballrooms, withclothes and the smirk of civilization added; Botticelli's "Spring" is the"corrobboree" further idealized, but with fewer clothes and more smirk.And well enough as to intention, but--my word!
The aboriginal can make a fire by friction.  I have tried that.
All savages are able to stand a good deal of physical pain.  TheAustralian aboriginal has this quality in a well-developed degree.  Donot read the following instances if horrors are not pleasant to you.They were recorded by the Rev. Henry N. Wolloston, of Melbourne, who hadbeen a surgeon before he became a clergyman:
     1.  "In the summer of 1852 I started on horseback from Albany, King     George's Sound, to visit at Cape Riche, accompanied by a native on     foot.  We traveled about forty miles the first day, then camped by a     water-hole for the night.  After cooking and eating our supper, I     observed the native, who had said nothing to me on the subject,     collect the hot embers of the fire together, and deliberately place     his right foot in the glowing mass for a moment, then suddenly     withdraw it, stamping on the ground and uttering a long-drawn     guttural sound of mingled pain and satisfaction.  This operation he     repeated several times.  On my inquiring the meaning of his strange     conduct, he only said, 'Me carpenter-make 'em' ('I am mending my     foot'), and then showed me his charred great toe, the nail of which     had been torn off by a tea-tree stump, in which it had been caught     during the journey, and the pain of which he had borne with stoical     composure until the evening, when he had an opportunity of     cauterizing the wound in the primitive manner above described."
And he proceeded on the journey the next day, "as if nothing hadhappened"--and walked thirty miles.  It was a strange idea, to keep asurgeon and then do his own surgery.
     2.  "A native about twenty-five years of age once applied to me, as     a doctor, to extract the wooden barb of a spear, which, during a     fight in the bush some four months previously, had entered his     chest, just missing the heart, and penetrated the viscera to a     considerable depth.  The spear had been cut off, leaving the barb     behind, which continued to force its way by muscular action     gradually toward the back; and when I examined him I could feel a     hard substance between the ribs below the left blade-bone.  I made a     deep incision, and with a pair of forceps extracted the barb, which     was made, as usual, of hard wood about four inches long and from     half an inch to an inch thick.  It was very smooth, and partly     digested, so to speak, by the maceration to which it had been     exposed during its four months' journey through the body.  The wound     made by the spear had long since healed, leaving only a small     cicatrix; and after the operation, which the native bore without     flinching, he appeared to suffer no pain.  Indeed, judging from his     good state of health, the presence of the foreign matter did not     materially annoy him.  He was perfectly well in a few days."
But No. 3 is my favorite.  Whenever I read it I seem to enjoy all thatthe patient enjoyed--whatever it was:
     3.  "Once at King George's Sound a native presented himself to me     with one leg only, and requested me to supply him with a wooden leg.     He had traveled in this maimed state about ninety-six miles, for     this purpose.  I examined the limb, which had been severed just     below the knee, and found that it had been charred by fire, while     about two inches of the partially calcined bone protruded through     the flesh.  I at once removed this with the saw; and having made as     presentable a stump of it as I could, covered the amputated end of     the bone with a surrounding of muscle, and kept the patient a few     days under my care to allow the wound to heal.  On inquiring, the     native told me that in a fight with other black-fellows a spear had     struck his leg and penetrated the bone below the knee.  Finding it     was serious, he had recourse to the following crude and barbarous     operation, which it appears is not uncommon among these people in     their native state.  He made a fire, and dug a hole in the earth     only sufficiently large to admit his leg, and deep enough to allow     the wounded part to be on a level with the surface of the ground.     He then surrounded the limb with the live coals or charcoal, which     was replenished until the leg was literally burnt off.  The     cauterization thus applied completely checked the hemorrhage, and he     was able in a day or two to hobble down to the Sound, with the aid     of a long stout stick, although he was more than a week on the     road."
But he was a fastidious native.  He soon discarded the wooden leg madefor him by the doctor, because "it had no feeling in it."  It must havehad as much as the one he burnt off, I should think.
So much for the Aboriginals.  It is difficult for me to let them alone.They are marvelously interesting creatures.  For a quarter of a century,now, the several colonial governments have housed their remnants incomfortable stations, and fed them well and taken good care of them inevery way.  If I had found this out while I was in Australia I could haveseen some of those people--but I didn't.  I would walk thirty miles tosee a stuffed one.
Australia has a slang of its own.  This is a matter of course.  The vastcattle and sheep industries, the strange aspects of the country, and thestrange native animals, brute and human, are matters which wouldnaturally breed a local slang.  I have notes of this slang somewhere, butat the moment I can call to mind only a few of the words and phrases.They are expressive ones.  The wide, sterile, unpeopled deserts havecreated eloquent phrases like "No Man's Land" and the "Never-neverCountry."  Also this felicitous form: "She lives in the Never-neverCountry"--that is, she is an old maid.  And this one is not withoutmerit: "heifer-paddock"--young ladies' seminary.  "Bail up" and "stickup" equivalent of our highwayman-term to "hold up" a stage-coach or atrain.  "New-chum" is the equivalent of our "tenderfoot"--new arrival.
And then there is the immortal "My word!"  "We must import it.""M-y word!"
In cold print it is the equivalent of our "Ger-rreat Caesar!" but spokenwith the proper Australian unction and fervency, it is worth six of itfor grace and charm and expressiveness.  Our form is rude and explosive;it is not suited to the drawing-room or the heifer-paddock; but "M-yword!" is, and is music to the ear, too, when the utterer knows how tosay it.  I saw it in print several times on the Pacific Ocean, but itstruck me coldly, it aroused no sympathy.  That was because it was thedead corpse of the thing, the 'soul was not there--the tones werelacking--the informing spirit--the deep feeling--the eloquence.  But thefirst time I heard an Australian say it, it was positively thrilling.
