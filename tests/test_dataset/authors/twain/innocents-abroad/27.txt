So far, good. If any man has a right to feel proud of himself, andsatisfied, surely it is I. For I have written about the Coliseum, andthe gladiators, the martyrs, and the lions, and yet have never once usedthe phrase "butchered to make a Roman holiday." I am the only free whiteman of mature age, who has accomplished this since Byron originated theexpression.
Butchered to make a Roman holiday sounds well for the first seventeen oreighteen hundred thousand times one sees it in print, but after that itbegins to grow tiresome. I find it in all the books concerning Rome--andhere latterly it reminds me of Judge Oliver. Oliver was a young lawyer,fresh from the schools, who had gone out to the deserts of Nevada tobegin life. He found that country, and our ways of life, there, in thoseearly days, different from life in New England or Paris. But he put on awoollen shirt and strapped a navy revolver to his person, took to thebacon and beans of the country, and determined to do in Nevada as Nevadadid. Oliver accepted the situation so completely that although he musthave sorrowed over many of his trials, he never complained--that is, henever complained but once. He, two others, and myself, started to thenew silver mines in the Humboldt mountains--he to be Probate Judge ofHumboldt county, and we to mine. The distance was two hundred miles. Itwas dead of winter. We bought a two-horse wagon and put eighteen hundredpounds of bacon, flour, beans, blasting-powder, picks and shovels in it;we bought two sorry-looking Mexican "plugs," with the hair turned thewrong way and more corners on their bodies than there are on the mosqueof Omar; we hitched up and started. It was a dreadful trip. But Oliverdid not complain. The horses dragged the wagon two miles from town andthen gave out. Then we three pushed the wagon seven miles, and Olivermoved ahead and pulled the horses after him by the bits. We complained,but Oliver did not. The ground was frozen, and it froze our backs whilewe slept; the wind swept across our faces and froze our noses. Oliverdid not complain. Five days of pushing the wagon by day and freezing bynight brought us to the bad part of the journey--the Forty Mile Desert,or the Great American Desert, if you please. Still, thismildest-mannered man that ever was, had not complained. We started acrossat eight in the morning, pushing through sand that had no bottom; toilingall day long by the wrecks of a thousand wagons, the skeletons of tenthousand oxen; by wagon-tires enough to hoop the Washington Monument tothe top, and ox-chains enough to girdle Long Island; by human graves;with our throats parched always, with thirst; lips bleeding from thealkali dust; hungry, perspiring, and very, very weary--so weary that whenwe dropped in the sand every fifty yards to rest the horses, we couldhardly keep from going to sleep--no complaints from Oliver: none the nextmorning at three o'clock, when we got across, tired to death.
Awakened two or three nights afterward at midnight, in a narrow canon, bythe snow falling on our faces, and appalled at the imminent danger ofbeing "snowed in," we harnessed up and pushed on till eight in themorning, passed the "Divide" and knew we were saved. No complaints.Fifteen days of hardship and fatigue brought us to the end of the twohundred miles, and the Judge had not complained. We wondered if anything could exasperate him. We built a Humboldt house. It is done inthis way. You dig a square in the steep base of the mountain, and set uptwo uprights and top them with two joists. Then you stretch a greatsheet of "cotton domestic" from the point where the joists join thehill-side down over the joists to the ground; this makes the roof and thefront of the mansion; the sides and back are the dirt walls your digginghas left. A chimney is easily made by turning up one corner of the roof.Oliver was sitting alone in this dismal den, one night, by a sage-brushfire, writing poetry; he was very fond of digging poetry out of himself--or blasting it out when it came hard. He heard an animal's footstepsclose to the roof; a stone or two and some dirt came through and fell byhim. He grew uneasy and said "Hi!--clear out from there, can't you!"--from time to time. But by and by he fell asleep where he sat, and prettysoon a mule fell down the chimney! The fire flew in every direction, andOliver went over backwards. About ten nights after that, he recoveredconfidence enough to go to writing poetry again. Again he dozed off tosleep, and again a mule fell down the chimney. This time, about half ofthat side of the house came in with the mule. Struggling to get up, themule kicked the candle out and smashed most of the kitchen furniture, andraised considerable dust. These violent awakenings must have beenannoying to Oliver, but he never complained. He moved to a mansion onthe opposite side of the canon, because he had noticed the mules did notgo there. One night about eight o'clock he was endeavoring to finish hispoem, when a stone rolled in--then a hoof appeared below the canvas--thenpart of a cow--the after part. He leaned back in dread, and shouted"Hooy! hooy! get out of this!" and the cow struggled manfully--lostground steadily--dirt and dust streamed down, and before Oliver could getwell away, the entire cow crashed through on to the table and made ashapeless wreck of every thing!
Then, for the first time in his life, I think, Oliver complained. Hesaid,
"This thing is growing monotonous!"
Then he resigned his judgeship and left Humboldt county. "Butchered tomake a Roman holyday" has grown monotonous to me.
In this connection I wish to say one word about Michael AngeloBuonarotti. I used to worship the mighty genius of Michael Angelo--thatman who was great in poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture--great inevery thing he undertook. But I do not want Michael Angelo forbreakfast--for luncheon--for dinner--for tea--for supper--for betweenmeals. I like a change, occasionally. In Genoa, he designed everything; in Milan he or his pupils designed every thing; he designed theLake of Como; in Padua, Verona, Venice, Bologna, who did we ever hear of,from guides, but Michael Angelo? In Florence, he painted every thing,designed every thing, nearly, and what he did not design he used to siton a favorite stone and look at, and they showed us the stone. In Pisahe designed every thing but the old shot-tower, and they would haveattributed that to him if it had not been so awfully out of theperpendicular. He designed the piers of Leghorn and the custom houseregulations of Civita Vecchia. But, here--here it is frightful. Hedesigned St. Peter's; he designed the Pope; he designed the Pantheon, theuniform of the Pope's soldiers, the Tiber, the Vatican, the Coliseum, theCapitol, the Tarpeian Rock, the Barberini Palace, St. John Lateran, theCampagna, the Appian Way, the Seven Hills, the Baths of Caracalla, theClaudian Aqueduct, the Cloaca Maxima--the eternal bore designed theEternal City, and unless all men and books do lie, he painted every thingin it! Dan said the other day to the guide, "Enough, enough, enough!Say no more! Lump the whole thing! say that the Creator made Italy fromdesigns by Michael Angelo!"
I never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil, so filledwith a blessed peace, as I did yesterday when I learned that MichaelAngelo was dead.
But we have taken it out of this guide. He has marched us through milesof pictures and sculpture in the vast corridors of the Vatican; andthrough miles of pictures and sculpture in twenty other palaces; he hasshown us the great picture in the Sistine Chapel, and frescoes enough tofrescoe the heavens--pretty much all done by Michael Angelo. So with himwe have played that game which has vanquished so many guides for us--imbecility and idiotic questions. These creatures never suspect--theyhave no idea of a sarcasm.
He shows us a figure and says: "Statoo brunzo." (Bronze statue.)
We look at it indifferently and the doctor asks: "By Michael Angelo?"
"No--not know who."
Then he shows us the ancient Roman Forum. The doctor asks: "MichaelAngelo?"
A stare from the guide. "No--thousan' year before he is born."
Then an Egyptian obelisk. Again: "Michael Angelo?"
"Oh, mon dieu, genteelmen! Zis is two thousan' year before he is born!"
He grows so tired of that unceasing question sometimes, that he dreads toshow us any thing at all. The wretch has tried all the ways he can thinkof to make us comprehend that Michael Angelo is only responsible for thecreation of a part of the world, but somehow he has not succeeded yet.Relief for overtasked eyes and brain from study and sightseeing isnecessary, or we shall become idiotic sure enough. Therefore this guidemust continue to suffer. If he does not enjoy it, so much the worse forhim. We do.
In this place I may as well jot down a chapter concerning those necessarynuisances, European guides. Many a man has wished in his heart he coulddo without his guide; but knowing he could not, has wished he could getsome amusement out of him as a remuneration for the affliction of hissociety. We accomplished this latter matter, and if our experience canbe made useful to others they are welcome to it.
Guides know about enough English to tangle every thing up so that a mancan make neither head or tail of it. They know their story by heart--thehistory of every statue, painting, cathedral or other wonder they showyou. They know it and tell it as a parrot would--and if you interrupt,and throw them off the track, they have to go back and begin over again.All their lives long, they are employed in showing strange things toforeigners and listening to their bursts of admiration. It is humannature to take delight in exciting admiration. It is what promptschildren to say "smart" things, and do absurd ones, and in other ways"show off" when company is present. It is what makes gossips turn out inrain and storm to go and be the first to tell a startling bit of news.Think, then, what a passion it becomes with a guide, whose privilege itis, every day, to show to strangers wonders that throw them into perfectecstasies of admiration! He gets so that he could not by any possibilitylive in a soberer atmosphere. After we discovered this, we never wentinto ecstasies any more--we never admired any thing--we never showed anybut impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence of thesublimest wonders a guide had to display. We had found their weak point.We have made good use of it ever since. We have made some of thosepeople savage, at times, but we have never lost our own serenity.
The doctor asks the questions, generally, because he can keep hiscountenance, and look more like an inspired idiot, and throw moreimbecility into the tone of his voice than any man that lives. It comesnatural to him.
The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American party, becauseAmericans so much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment and emotionbefore any relic of Columbus. Our guide there fidgeted about as if hehad swallowed a spring mattress. He was full of animation--full ofimpatience. He said:
"Come wis me, genteelmen!--come! I show you ze letter writing byChristopher Colombo!--write it himself!--write it wis his own hand!--come!"
He took us to the municipal palace. After much impressive fumbling ofkeys and opening of locks, the stained and aged document was spreadbefore us. The guide's eyes sparkled. He danced about us and tapped theparchment with his finger:
"What I tell you, genteelmen! Is it not so? See! handwritingChristopher Colombo!--write it himself!"
We looked indifferent--unconcerned. The doctor examined the documentvery deliberately, during a painful pause.--Then he said, without anyshow of interest:
"Ah--Ferguson--what--what did you say was the name of the party who wrotethis?"
"Christopher Colombo! ze great Christopher Colombo!"
Another deliberate examination.
"Ah--did he write it himself; or--or how?"
"He write it himself!--Christopher Colombo! He's own hand-writing, writeby himself!"
Then the doctor laid the document down and said:
"Why, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that couldwrite better than that."
"But zis is ze great Christo--"
"I don't care who it is! It's the worst writing I ever saw. Now youmusn't think you can impose on us because we are strangers. We are notfools, by a good deal. If you have got any specimens of penmanship ofreal merit, trot them out!--and if you haven't, drive on!"
We drove on. The guide was considerably shaken up, but he made one moreventure. He had something which he thought would overcome us. He said:
"Ah, genteelmen, you come wis me! I show you beautiful, O, magnificentbust Christopher Colombo!--splendid, grand, magnificent!"
He brought us before the beautiful bust--for it was beautiful--and sprangback and struck an attitude:
"Ah, look, genteelmen!--beautiful, grand,--bust Christopher Colombo!--beautiful bust, beautiful pedestal!"
The doctor put up his eye-glass--procured for such occasions:
"Ah--what did you say this gentleman's name was?"
"Christopher Colombo!--ze great Christopher Colombo!"
"Christopher Colombo--the great Christopher Colombo. Well, what did hedo?"
"Discover America!--discover America, Oh, ze devil!"
"Discover America. No--that statement will hardly wash. We are justfrom America ourselves. We heard nothing about it. Christopher Colombo--pleasant name--is--is he dead?"
"Oh, corpo di Baccho!--three hundred year!"
"What did he die of?"
"I do not know!--I can not tell."
"Small-pox, think?"
"I do not know, genteelmen!--I do not know what he die of!"
"Measles, likely?"
"May be--may be--I do not know--I think he die of somethings."
"Parents living?"
"Im-poseeeble!"
"Ah--which is the bust and which is the pedestal?"
"Santa Maria!--zis ze bust!--zis ze pedestal!"
"Ah, I see, I see--happy combination--very happy combination, indeed.Is--is this the first time this gentleman was ever on a bust?"
That joke was lost on the foreigner--guides can not master the subtletiesof the American joke.
We have made it interesting for this Roman guide. Yesterday we spentthree or four hours in the Vatican, again, that wonderful world ofcuriosities. We came very near expressing interest, sometimes--evenadmiration--it was very hard to keep from it. We succeeded though.Nobody else ever did, in the Vatican museums. The guide was bewildered--non-plussed. He walked his legs off, nearly, hunting up extraordinarythings, and exhausted all his ingenuity on us, but it was a failure; wenever showed any interest in any thing. He had reserved what heconsidered to be his greatest wonder till the last--a royal Egyptianmummy, the best preserved in the world, perhaps. He took us there. Hefelt so sure, this time, that some of his old enthusiasm came back tohim:
"See, genteelmen!--Mummy! Mummy!"
The eye-glass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever.
"Ah,--Ferguson--what did I understand you to say the gentleman's namewas?"
"Name?--he got no name!--Mummy!--'Gyptian mummy!"
"Yes, yes. Born here?"
"No! 'Gyptian mummy!"
"Ah, just so. Frenchman, I presume?"
"No!--not Frenchman, not Roman!--born in Egypta!"
"Born in Egypta. Never heard of Egypta before. Foreign locality,likely. Mummy--mummy. How calm he is--how self-possessed. Is, ah--ishe dead?"
"Oh, sacre bleu, been dead three thousan' year!"
The doctor turned on him savagely:
"Here, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this! Playing us forChinamen because we are strangers and trying to learn! Trying to imposeyour vile second-hand carcasses on us!--thunder and lightning, I've anotion to--to--if you've got a nice fresh corpse, fetch him out!--or byGeorge we'll brain you!"
We make it exceedingly interesting for this Frenchman. However, he haspaid us back, partly, without knowing it. He came to the hotel thismorning to ask if we were up, and he endeavored as well as he could todescribe us, so that the landlord would know which persons he meant. Hefinished with the casual remark that we were lunatics. The observationwas so innocent and so honest that it amounted to a very good thing for aguide to say.
There is one remark (already mentioned,) which never yet has failed todisgust these guides. We use it always, when we can think of nothingelse to say. After they have exhausted their enthusiasm pointing outto us and praising the beauties of some ancient bronze image orbroken-legged statue, we look at it stupidly and in silence for five,ten, fifteen minutes--as long as we can hold out, in fact--and then ask:
"Is--is he dead?"
That conquers the serenest of them. It is not what they are looking for--especially a new guide. Our Roman Ferguson is the most patient,unsuspecting, long-suffering subject we have had yet. We shall be sorryto part with him. We have enjoyed his society very much. We trust hehas enjoyed ours, but we are harassed with doubts.
We have been in the catacombs. It was like going down into a very deepcellar, only it was a cellar which had no end to it. The narrow passagesare roughly hewn in the rock, and on each hand as you pass along, thehollowed shelves are carved out, from three to fourteen deep; each held acorpse once. There are names, and Christian symbols, and prayers, orsentences expressive of Christian hopes, carved upon nearly everysarcophagus. The dates belong away back in the dawn of the Christianera, of course. Here, in these holes in the ground, the first Christianssometimes burrowed to escape persecution. They crawled out at night toget food, but remained under cover in the day time. The priest told usthat St. Sebastian lived under ground for some time while he was beinghunted; he went out one day, and the soldiery discovered and shot him todeath with arrows. Five or six of the early Popes--those who reignedabout sixteen hundred years ago--held their papal courts and advised withtheir clergy in the bowels of the earth. During seventeen years--fromA.D. 235 to A.D. 252--the Popes did not appear above ground. Four wereraised to the great office during that period. Four years apiece, orthereabouts. It is very suggestive of the unhealthiness of undergroundgraveyards as places of residence. One Pope afterward spent his entirepontificate in the catacombs--eight years. Another was discovered inthem and murdered in the episcopal chair. There was no satisfaction inbeing a Pope in those days. There were too many annoyances. There areone hundred and sixty catacombs under Rome, each with its maze of narrowpassages crossing and recrossing each other and each passage walled tothe top with scooped graves its entire length. A careful estimate makesthe length of the passages of all the catacombs combined foot up ninehundred miles, and their graves number seven millions. We did not gothrough all the passages of all the catacombs. We were very anxious todo it, and made the necessary arrangements, but our too limited timeobliged us to give up the idea. So we only groped through the dismallabyrinth of St. Callixtus, under the Church of St. Sebastian. In thevarious catacombs are small chapels rudely hewn in the stones, and herethe early Christians often held their religious services by dim, ghostlylights. Think of mass and a sermon away down in those tangled cavernsunder ground!
In the catacombs were buried St. Cecilia, St. Agnes, and several other ofthe most celebrated of the saints. In the catacomb of St. Callixtus, St.Bridget used to remain long hours in holy contemplation, and St. CharlesBorromeo was wont to spend whole nights in prayer there. It was also thescene of a very marvelous thing. 
     "Here the heart of St. Philip Neri was so inflamed with divine love     as to burst his ribs."
I find that grave statement in a book published in New York in 1808, andwritten by "Rev. William H. Neligan, LL.D., M. A., Trinity College,Dublin; Member of the Archaeological Society of Great Britain."Therefore, I believe it.  Otherwise, I could not.  Under othercircumstances I should have felt a curiosity to know what Philip had fordinner.
This author puts my credulity on its mettle every now and then.  He tellsof one St. Joseph Calasanctius whose house in Rome he visited; he visitedonly the house--the priest has been dead two hundred years.  He says theVirgin Mary appeared to this saint.  Then he continues:
     "His tongue and his heart, which were found after nearly a century     to be whole, when the body was disinterred before his canonization,     are still preserved in a glass case, and after two centuries the     heart is still whole.  When the French troops came to Rome, and when     Pius VII. was carried away prisoner, blood dropped from it."
To read that in a book written by a monk far back in the Middle Ages,would surprise no one; it would sound natural and proper; but when it isseriously stated in the middle of the nineteenth century, by a man offinished education, an LL.D., M. A., and an Archaeological magnate, itsounds strangely enough.  Still, I would gladly change my unbelief forNeligan's faith, and let him make the conditions as hard as he pleased.
The old gentleman's undoubting, unquestioning simplicity has a rarefreshness about it in these matter-of-fact railroading and telegraphingdays.  Hear him, concerning the church of Ara Coeli: 
     "In the roof of the church, directly above the high altar, is     engraved, 'Regina Coeli laetare Alleluia.'  In the sixth century     Rome was visited by a fearful pestilence.  Gregory the Great urged     the people to do penance, and a general procession was formed.  It     was to proceed from Ara Coeli to St. Peter's.  As it passed before     the mole of Adrian, now the Castle of St. Angelo, the sound of     heavenly voices was heard singing (it was Easter morn,) 'Regina     Coeli, laetare! alleluia! quia quem meruisti portare, alleluia!     resurrexit sicut dixit; alleluia!'  The Pontiff, carrying in his     hands the portrait of the Virgin, (which is over the high altar and     is said to have been painted by St. Luke,) answered, with the     astonished people, 'Ora pro nobis Deum, alleluia!'  At the same time     an angel was seen to put up a sword in a scabbard, and the     pestilence ceased on the same day.  There are four circumstances     which 'CONFIRM'--[The italics are mine--M. T.]--this miracle: the     annual procession which takes place in the western church on the     feast of St Mark; the statue of St. Michael, placed on the mole of     Adrian, which has since that time been called the Castle of St.     Angelo; the antiphon Regina Coeli which the Catholic church sings     during paschal time; and the inscription in the church."
